diversity and inclusion 

 

we hold strongly to the principle that a qualified diverse workforce and inclusive workplace helps us represent the broad crosssection of ideas values and beliefs of our employees customers suppliers and communities in 2017 we established our diversity and inclusion initiative which reaches enterprisewide and aims to create an inclusive culture and environment where employees from all backgrounds can succeed and be heard employees are evaluated and hired nationally in accordance with established criteria and regulatory requirements specific to their anticipated role within the company

 

in addition the company’s employee resource groups ergs offer opportunities for employee professional development community engagement and networking comprised of groups for women latinos veterans lgbtqia and african americans our ergs promote camaraderie within the workforce and allow employees with similar interests to build meaningful work relationships

 

employee safety and health 

 

the health and wellbeing of our workforce is a priority as we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all our operations as safely as possible jb hunt employees participate in regular jobspecific safety training programs in addition jb hunt’s million mile safe driving and recognition awards program has recognized and rewarded our drivers who dedicate themselves to accidentfree driving since its inception in 1996 the program has awarded more than 33 million to over 4100 drivers

 

we believe that access to quality healthcare is also an important part of this priority and we have programs in place that focus on improving the quality of care that our employees and their families receive paid leave is another key component of this focus and the company offers benefit plans that comply with all applicable laws

 

in response to covid19 we implemented safety response activities at our home office campus and all other field locations throughout north america which included requiring remote working when possible expanded health and safety policies facility modifications increased security coverage and purchase and distribution of personal protective equipment and supplies during 2021 we committed to providing incremental paid time off for employees to help offset any financial loss caused by their absence from work when receiving the covid19 vaccination due to the nature of our business and the large portion of our workforce consisting of drivers and other nonoffice personnel fewer than 25 of our total employees have been able to work remotely however we remain committed to the safety of our workforce suppliers and customers while continuing to meet our customers’ needs

 

 

revenue equipment 

 

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our fms segment primarily utilizes straight trucks or similar equipment through thirdparty carriers while the jbt segment operates primarily 53foot dryvan trailers

 

as of december 31 2021 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 18757 units in addition we had 2108 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers improved fuel efficiency and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2021 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 25 years while our containers averaged 82 years of age and our trailers averaged 66 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities

 

competition and the industry 

 

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs and fms segments attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country

 

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services

 

regulation 

 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries we are also subject to a variety of requirements of national state and local governments including the us environmental protection agency and the occupational safety and health administration

 

on september 9 2021 president biden issued an executive order that in conjunction with guidance issued pursuant to the order requires all employers with us government contracts to require their usbased employees contractors or subcontractors who work on or in support of certain us government contracts to be fully vaccinated for covid19 by december 8 2021 with limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons permitted various states have challenged the mandate in multiple federal district courts resulting in the enforcement of this mandate to be currently enjoined nationwide we are awaiting final resolution of this matter but do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity

 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water these laws and regulations have the effect of increasing the costs risks and liabilities associated with our applicable operations we are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change if current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities

 

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the factors outlined previously in this form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks

 

risks related to our industry 

 

our business is significantly impacted by economic conditions customer business cycles and seasonal factors 

 

our business is dependent on the freight shipping needs of our customers which can be heavily impacted by economic conditions and other factors affecting their businesses recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers may substantially reduce freight volumes for which our customers need transportation services and lead to excess capacity in the industry and resulting pressure on the rates we are able to obtain for our services adverse economic conditions may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

our business is significantly impacted by the effects of national or international health pandemics on general economic conditions and the operations of our customers and thirdparty suppliers and service providers 

 

our operations can be heavily impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease principally the recent outbreak of the covid19 virus the effects of the covid19 pandemic have and may continue to disrupt or restrict the freight shipping activities of some of our customers on which our business is dependent in addition adverse economic conditions caused by covid19 may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses furthermore the continuation or resumption of covid19 related social and economic disruptions may lead to other events which could negatively impact our operations including service limitations of our thirdparty purchased transportation providers reduced availability of drivers and other key employees disruptions in the procurement of revenue equipment restrictions at us ports of call excess capacity or rate reductions within the intermodal or trucking industries inability of suppliers to continue activities or volatile financial credit markets the extent to which the covid19 outbreak and any future resurgences will impact general economic and business conditions is highly uncertain and unpredictable however any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

 

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

 

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs

 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change compliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 

we are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change if current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the bnsf and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth

 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2021 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

 

 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2022 with substantially the same terms as our 2021 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected

 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

the dot fmcsa and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations our failure to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations to which we are subject whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments further these agencies could institute new laws rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time compliance with new laws rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services

 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services

 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

 

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins

 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services

 

risks related to our business 

 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2021 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 39 of our revenue one customer accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs and fms segments may involve longterm written contracts those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

 

 

a determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs 

 

federal and state legislation as well as tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors an example of such legislation recently enacted in california is currently under a judicial stay with respect to trucking companies while a legal challenge to the law is pending there can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that reclassifies independent contractors to be employees if our independent contractors are determined to be our employees that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax workers’ compensation unemployment benefits labor employment and tort laws as well as our potential liability for employee benefits in addition such changes may be applied retroactively and if so we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results

 

we may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures 

 

we by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation including personal injury claims vehicular collisions and accidents alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws such as classaction lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay commercial and contract disputes cargo loss and property damage claims while we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance we accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation its likelihood of success and an evaluation of the possible range of loss our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which or an inability to keep pace with technological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth we have also invested significantly in the development of our marketplace for jb hunt 360 online freight matching platform through which we are generating an increasing amount of revenue each of our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks theft or misuse of data terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation we also could experience an inability to keep pace with technological advances resulting in our information technology platforms becoming obsolete or our competitors developing related or similar service offerings more effective than ours

 

 

acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings 

 

a substantial portion of the growth of our fms segment has resulted from strategic acquisitions and our future growth strategy for fms and possibly other operating segments may involve the acquisition of one or more businesses we could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets personnel and operations with our own regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our operating costs acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks including without limitation the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies difficulties in maintaining controls procedures and policies potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees failure to realize expected efficiencies synergies and cost savings or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired

 

our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving fms or other segments many of which cannot be presently identified

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following

 

workers ’ compensation and accident costs 

 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment

 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type for 2019 through 2021 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for workers’ compensation claims for nearly all states we have policies in place for 2022 with substantially the same terms as our 2021 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage

 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate personal injury and property damage claim liability this process involves the use of expected loss rates lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and contractual premium adjustment factors if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2021 we had an accrual of approximately 287 million for estimated claims in addition we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of selfinsurance levels on covered claims at december 31 2021 we have recorded 311 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims other insurance deposits and prepaid insurance premiums

 

revenue equipment 

 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2021

 

 

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense

 

revenue recognition 

 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services accordingly we serve as a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for selection of thirdparty transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements

 

we recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided with related expenses recognized as incurred accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period

 

our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables are recorded at amounts billed to customers when loads are delivered or services are performed the allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated over the life of the underlying receivable and is based on historical experience any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts each applied to segregated risk pools based on the business segment that generated the receivable the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision

 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year

 

  

2021 compared with 2020 

 

consolidated operating revenues 

 

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 263 to 1217 billion in 2021 compared to 964 billion in 2020 this increase was primarily due to increased ics and jbt revenue higher jbi revenue per load increased average revenue producing trucks and fleet productivity within dcs and increased fms stops and revenue per stop fuel surcharge revenues increased 655 to 125 billion in 2021 compared to 757 million in 2020 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2021 revenue increased 229 over 2020

 

consolidated operating expenses 

 

our 2021 consolidated operating expenses increased 246 from 2020 while yearoveryear revenue increased 263 resulting in a 2021 operating ratio of 914 compared to 926 in 2020

 

rents and purchased transportation costs increased 302 in 2021 primarily due to increased thirdparty rail and truck purchased transportation rates in jbi and ics increased ics load volume and an increase in the use of thirdparty truck carriers by jbt and fms during 2021 salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 176 in 2021 from 2020 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to a tighter supply of qualified drivers a trend we anticipate continuing and an increase in the number of employees as well as an increase in incentive compensation compared to 2020 depreciation and amortization expense increased 56 in 2021 primarily due to equipment purchases related to new dcs longterm customer contracts the addition of trailing equipment and scheduled turnover of tractors within jbi higher trailer counts in jbt and increased capital investments in information technology

 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 484 in 2021 compared with 2020 due primarily to an increase in the price of fuel during 2021 and increased road miles we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense

 

operating supplies and expenses increased 105 in 2021 compared with 2020 driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance costs increased tire expense increased tolls expense higher travel and entertainment expense and higher weatherrelated towing costs partially offset by reduced operating supplies and building maintenance costs in response to covid19 compared to 2020 general and administrative expenses increased 86 from 2020 primarily due to higher advertising costs increased technology spend and increased driver hiring expenses partially offset by a 57 million benefit from the reduction of a contingent liability in the fms segment additionally net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 55 million in 2021 compared to net losses of 44 million in 2020 insurance and claims expense increased 227 in 2021 primarily due to higher incident volume and severity and increased insurance policy premium expenses partially offset by a 32 million benefit from the net settlement of claims within the fms segment

 

net interest expense for 2021 decreased by 28 compared with 2020 due to lower effective interest rates on our debt income tax expense increased 494 in 2021 due primarily to increased taxable earnings in 2021 our effective income tax rate was 239 in 2021 and 240 in 2020

 

segments 

 

we operated five business segments during calendar year 2021 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

 

  

  

 

operating data by segment 

 

  

    

 

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue increased 17 to 545 billion in 2021 from 468 billion in 2020 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of an 19 increase in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rate changes cost recovery efforts and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 2 decrease in load volume eastern network load volumes increased 1 and transcontinental loads decreased 3 compared to 2020 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased 14 compared to 2020

 

operating income of the jbi segment increased to 603 million in 2021 from 428 million in 2020 benefits from increased revenue per load were partially offset by network inefficiencies caused by continued rail and customer fluidity challenges higher rail and thirdparty dray purchased transportation expense higher driver wages and recruiting costs increased nondriver salary wages and incentive compensation and higher equipment costs when compared to 2020

 

dcs segment 

 

dcs segment revenue increased 17 to 258 billion in 2021 from 220 billion in 2020 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week increased 8 compared to 2020 productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 5 from 2020 the increase in productivity was primarily a result of contracted indexedbased price escalators and less unassigned idle equipment partially offset by expected lower productivity within startup accounts and an increase in open assigned trucks due to the tighter supply of qualified drivers and covidrelated labor disruptions customer retention rates remain above 98

 

operating income of our dcs segment decreased to 304 million in 2021 from 314 million in 2020 higher revenues during the current year were more than offset by increases in driver wage and recruiting costs increased nondriver salary wages and incentive compensation increased casualty insurance and claims costs higher group medical benefits and additional costs related to the implementation of new longterm customer contracts

 

ics segment 

 

ics segment revenue increased 53 to 254 billion in 2021 from 166 billion in 2020 revenue per load increased 46 when compared to 2020 primarily due to higher spot and contractual customer rates within the truckload business and changes in customer freight mix when compared to 2020 overall volumes increased 5 with truckload volumes increasing 13 when compared to 2020 contractual business was 51 of the total load volume and 39 of the total revenue in the 2021 compared to 60 of the total load volume and 43 of the total revenue in 2020

 

ics segment had operating income of 46 million in 2021 compared to an operating loss of 45 million in 2020 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue and higher gross profit margins partially offset by higher personnel incentive compensation and increased technology costs gross profit margin increased to 118 in the current year versus 99 last year approximately 158 billion of ics revenue for 2021 was executed through the marketplace for jb hunt 360 compared to 114 billion in 2020 ics’s carrier base increased 36 when compared to 2020

 

fms segment 

 

fms revenue increased 22 to 842 million in 2021 from 689 million in 2020 primarily due to the addition of multiple customer contracts implemented during the current year and 2020 including temporary suspension of operations at several customer sites as a result of the covid19 pandemic stop count for 2021 increased 11 while productivity defined as revenue per stop increased 10 compared to 2020 the increase in productivity was primarily due to a shift in the mix of business between asset and assetlight operations and the implementation of higher rates

 

fms segment had operating income of 28 million in 2021 compared to an operating loss of 1 million in 2020 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenues a 57 million benefit from the reduction of a contingent liability and a 32 million benefit from the net settlement of claims these items were partially offset by higher implementation costs related to new longterm contractual business higher thirdparty contract carrier costs lower volumes with certain customers related to product availability because of supply chain disruptions and higher personnel salary wages and incentive compensation

 

 

jbt segment 

 

jbt segment revenue increased 72 to 796 million in 2021 from 463 million in 2020 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2021 increased 70 compared to 2020 primarily due to a 10 increase in load volume and a 55 increase in revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue per load compared to 2020 the 2021 growth in load count was primarily due to the continued expansion of jb hunt 360box which leverages the jb hunt 360 platform to access drop trailer capacity for customers across our transportation network at the end of 2021 jbt operated 2235 tractors and 11172 trailers compared to 1769 and 8567 at the end of 2020

 

jbt segment had operating income of 65 million in 2021 compared with 17 million in 2020 the increase in operating income was driven primarily by increased load counts and revenue per load during 2021 which were partially offset by increases in purchased transportation expense higher costs to attract and retain drivers higher nondriver salary wages and incentive compensation and additional costs from further investments in the trailer network and technology related to the continued expansion of jb hunt 360box

 

 

2020 compared with 2019 

 

consolidated operating revenues 

 

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 51 to 964 billion in 2020 compared to 917 billion in 2019 primarily due to increased ics revenue per load the december 2019 acquisition and new contractual business onboarded throughout 2020 in fms and increased load volumes in jbt and dcs the increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in jbi revenue per load fuel surcharge revenues decreased 274 to 757 million in 2020 compared to 104 billion in 2019 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2020 revenue increased 93 over 2019

rents and purchased transportation costs increased 94 in 2020 primarily due to increased load volume and thirdparty rail and truck purchased transportation rates in jbi and ics and an increase in the use of thirdparty truck carriers by fms and jbt during 2020 partially offset by jbi 2019 rail purchased transportation costs including a 268 million charge resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 83 in 2020 from 2019 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to a tighter supply of qualified drivers and an increase in the number of employees as well as higher cost of employee group medical benefits compared to 2019 in addition 2020 included a 123 million onetime covid19 related bonus paid to employee drivers and other key field personnel depreciation and amortization expense increased 57 in 2020 primarily due to equipment purchases related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and the addition of standard and specialized trailing equipment within our jbi segment

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 228 in 2020 compared with 2019 due primarily to a decrease in the price of fuel during 2020

 

 

operating supplies and expenses were virtually flat in 2020 compared with 2019 driven primarily by higher operating supplies and building maintenance costs in response to covid19 increased toll costs and higher equipment maintenance costs offset by reduced travel and entertainment expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 62 from 2019 primarily due to decreased professional fees lower advertising costs lower driver hiring expenses and decreased net loss from the sale or disposal of assets partially offset by increased technology spend on the jb hunt 360 platform and legacy system upgrades higher bad debt expenses and increased building rental expenses additionally net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 44 million in 2020 compared to net losses of 131 million in 2019 insurance and claims expense decreased 145 in 2020 primarily due to the absence of a 20 million fms claim settlement charge and 174 million in reserve charges in 2019 for arbitration related legal fees cost and interest claimed by bnsf partially offset by an increase in insurance premiums in 2020

 

net interest expense for 2020 decreased by 110 compared with 2019 due to lower effective interest rates on our debt income tax expense decreased 28 in 2020 due primarily to decreased taxable earnings in 2020 our effective income tax rate was 240 in 2020 and 242 in 2019

 

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue decreased 1 to 468 billion in 2020 from 474 billion in 2019 this decrease in revenue was primarily a result of a 3 decrease in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 2 increase in load volume eastern network load volumes decreased 1 and transcontinental loads increased 4 compared to 2019 average length of haul increased 1 in 2020 when compared to 2019 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 1 compared to 2019

 

operating income of the jbi segment decreased to 428 million in 2020 from 447 million in 2019 benefits from increased load volume in 2020 were more than offset by higher rail purchased transportation costs covid19 related network inefficiencies higher personnel costs which included a onetime covid19 related bonus paid to employee drivers and other key field personnel and higher dray costs resulting from disruptions in rail capacity and a constricted labor and truck capacity environment operating income for jbi in 2019 was impacted by a 268 million charge to rail purchase transportation expense resulting from the issuance of a final award regarding our arbitration with bnsf and a 174 million charge to insurance and claims expense for arbitration related legal fees cost and interest claimed by bnsf

 

dcs segment 

 

dcs segment revenue increased 3 to 220 billion in 2020 from 213 billion in 2019 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week remained flat when compared to 2019 productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 2 from 2019 the increase in productivity was primarily a result of better utilization of assets between customer accounts contracted customer rate increases and increased customer supply chain fluidity customer retention rates remain above 98

 

operating income of our dcs segment increased to 314 million in 2020 from 278 million in 2019 the increase is primarily due to increased fleet productivity the absence of significant new customer implementation costs throughout the majority of the year lower driver related turnover costs and lower travel and entertainment expenses operating income was partially offset by higher nondriver personnel costs a onetime covid19 related bonus and higher equipment ownership costs when compared to 2019

 

ics segment 

 

ics segment revenue increased 23 to 166 billion in 2020 from 135 billion in 2019 overall volumes increased 2 with truckload volumes increasing 15 when compared to 2019 revenue per load increased 21 when compared to 2019 primarily due to customer mix changes and higher spot and contractual pricing contractual business was approximately 60 of the total load volume and 43 of the total revenue in the 2020 compared to 65 of the total load volume and 49 of the total revenue in 2019

 

ics segment incurred an operating loss of 45 million in 2020 compared to operating loss of 11 million in 2019 the increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower gross profit margins and increased technology spending as the marketplace for jb hunt 360 continues to expand in functionality and capacity gross profit margin decreased to 99 in 2020 versus 131 last year primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment and constricted supply dynamics compared to 2019 approximately 114 billion of ics revenue for 2020 was executed through the marketplace for jb hunt 360 compared to 840 million in 2019 ics’s carrier base increased 19

 

 

fms segment 

 

fms revenue increased 22 to 689 million in 2020 from 567 million in 2019 primarily due to two business acquisitions completed in 2019 and an increase in new customer contracts throughout 2020 partially offset by the temporary suspension of operations at various customer sites in 2020 as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic stop count for 2020 increased 30 and productivity defined as revenue per stop decreased 7 compared to 2019 the reduction in productivity was primarily due to a change in the mix of service methods to a more assetlight model resulting from the 2019 business acquisitions and a shift in the mix of services provided during 2020 as customers were affected by covid19 within our fms network

 

fms segment had an operating loss of 1 million in 2020 compared to an operating loss of 9 million in 2019 the current period operating loss was primarily due to increased costs to expand and improve through service quality performance controls the fms network lost revenue resulting from the temporary suspension of operations at several customer sites in response to covid19 higher bad debt expense higher personnel costs which included a onetime covid19 related bonus higher covid19 related operating supplies expense an increase in noncash amortization expense attributable to the 2019 business acquisitions fms segment operating loss for 2019 included a 20 million insurance claim settlement charge

 

jbt segment 

 

jbt segment revenue increased 19 to 463 million in 2020 from 389 million in 2019 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2020 increased 23 compared to 2019 primarily due to a 17 increase in load volume and a 5 increase in revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue per load compared to 2019 the 2020 growth in load count was partially due to the continued expansion of jb hunt 360box which leverages the jb hunt 360 platform at the end of 2020 jbt operated 1769 tractors and 8567 trailers compared to 1831 and 6975 at the end of 2019

 

jbt segment had operating income of 17 million in 2020 compared with 29 million in 2019 the decrease in operating income was driven primarily by higher purchased transportation expense and higher nondriver personnel cost and technology modernization expenses for the continued expansion of jb hunt 360box compared to 2019

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 122 billion in 2021 compared to 112 billion in 2020 due to increased earnings partially offset by the timing of general working capital activities

 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 877 million in 2021 compared with 613 million in 2020 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in equipment purchases net of proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2021

 

net cash used in financing activities was 305 million in 2021 compared with 232 million in 2020 this increase resulted primarily from an increase in treasury stock purchased and dividends paid in 2021

 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 026 per share quarterly dividend in 2019 a 027 per share quarterly dividend in 2020 a 028 per share quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2021 and a 030 per share quarterly dividend in the last three quarters of 2021 on january 20 2022 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 030 to 040 per share which was paid february 18 2022 to stockholders of record on february 4 2022 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid

 

liquidity 

 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers and chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment as well as periodic business acquisitions we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements or other capital expenditures depending on market and overall economic conditions however we do anticipate that the current challenges related to timely delivery of ordered equipment will continue due to supply chain challenges impacting production in recent years we have obtained capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment for our senior notes maturing in 2022 it is our intent to pay the entire outstanding balances in full on or before the maturity dates using our existing cash balance senior revolving line of credit or other sources of longterm financing

 

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future at december 31 2021 we had a cash balance of 356 million and we had no outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit which authorizes us to borrow up to 750 million under a senior revolving line of credit and is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks that expires in september 2023 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees

 

we continue to evaluate the possible effects of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts on operational cash flows including the risks of declines in the overall freight market and our customers liquidity and ability to pay we regularly monitor working capital and maintain frequent communication with our customers suppliers and service providers a large portion of our cost structure is variable purchased transportation expense represents more than half of our total costs but is heavily tied to load volumes our second largest cost item is salaries and wages the largest portion of which is driver pay which includes a large variable component

 

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first is 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 which was issued in march 2014 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning september 2014 the second is 350 million of 330 senior notes due august 2022 issued in august 2015 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year beginning february 2016 the third is 700 million of 3875 senior notes due march 2026 issued in march 2019 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning september 2019 we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively convert our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to a variable rate resulting in an interest rates of 151 at december 31 2021 the applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on libor plus an established margin

 

 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2021 we were well above compliance with all covenants and financial ratios and we fully intend and expect to emerge from the current covid19 related economic environment with our investmentgrade rating intact in addition we do not anticipate the future international transitioning from libor to alternative rates to have a material impact on our financial statements

 

we are currently committed to spend a total of approximately 188 billion net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2022 and 2023 which is primarily related to the acquisition of tractors containers chassis and other trailing equipment

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements other than our net purchase commitments of 188 billion as of december 31 2021

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 330 to 3875 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to a variable rate the applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 35 million

 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2021 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the factors outlined previously in this form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks

 

risk s r elated to our industry 

 

our business is significantly impacted by economic conditions customer business cycles and seasonal factors 

 

our business is dependent on the freight shipping needs of our customers which can be heavily impacted by economic conditions and other factors affecting their businesses recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers may substantially reduce freight volumes for which our customers need transportation services and lead to excess capacity in the industry and resulting pressure on the rates we are able to obtain for our services adverse economic conditions may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

 

our business is significantly impacted by the effects of national or international health pandemics on general economic conditions and the operations of our customers and thirdparty suppliers and service providers 

  

our operations can be heavily impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease principally the recent outbreak of the covid19 virus this virus has spread throughout multiple countries including the united states and in march 2020 the world health organization designated covid19 as a pandemic the effects of covid19 have and may continue to disrupt or restrict the freight shipping activities of some of our customers on which our business is dependent in addition adverse economic conditions caused by covid19 may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses furthermore the continuation of covid19 related social and economic disruptions may lead to other events which could negatively impact our operations including service limitations of our thirdparty purchased transportation providers reduced availability of drivers and other key employees disruptions in the procurement of revenue equipment restrictions at us ports of call excess capacity or rate reductions within the intermodal or trucking industries inability of suppliers to continue activities or volatile financial credit markets the extent to which the covid19 outbreak will impact general economic and business conditions is highly uncertain and unpredictable however any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change compliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 

we are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change if current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the bnsf and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

 

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth

 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2020 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2021 with substantially the same terms as our 2020 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected

 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot fmcsa and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations our failure to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations to which we are subject whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments further these agencies could institute new laws rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time compliance with new laws rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services

 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services

 

 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins

 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services

  

risk s related to our business 

 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2020 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 37 of our revenue one customer accounted for approximately 10 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve longterm written contracts those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

 

a determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs  

  

federal and state legislation as well as tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors an example of such legislation recently enacted in california is currently under a judicial stay with respect to trucking companies while a legal challenge to the law is pending there can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that reclassifies independent contractors to be employees if our independent contractors are determined to be our employees that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax workers’ compensation unemployment benefits labor employment and tort laws as well as our potential liability for employee benefits in addition such changes may be applied retroactively and if so we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results

 

we may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures 

 

we by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation including personal injury claims vehicular collisions and accidents alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws such as classaction lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay commercial and contract disputes cargo loss and property damage claims while we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance we accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation its likelihood of success and an evaluation of the possible range of loss our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

 

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth we have also invested significantly in the development of our marketplace for jb hunt 360° online freight matching platform through which we are generating an increasing amount of revenue each of our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks theft or misuse of data terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation we also could experience an inability to keep pace with technological advances resulting in our information technology platforms becoming obsolete or our competitors developing related or similar service offerings more effective than ours

 

acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings 

 

a substantial portion of the growth of our fms segment has resulted from strategic acquisitions and our future growth strategy for fms and possibly other operating segments may involve the acquisition of one or more businesses we could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets personnel and operations with our own regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our operating costs acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks including without limitation the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies difficulties in maintaining controls procedures and policies potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees failure to realize expected efficiencies synergies and cost savings or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired

 

our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving fms or other segments many of which cannot be presently identified

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

in january 2017 we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1 2016 as well as to clarify other issues under our joint service agreement with bnsf bnsf requested the same in october 2019 the arbitrators issued a final award and we recorded pretax charges in the third quarter 2019 of 268 million related to certain charges claimed by bnsf and 174 million for legal fees cost and interest claimed by bnsf for a total of 442 million on january 17 2020 we filed under seal in the united states district court for the western district of arkansas the arkansas federal court a motion to confirm and enforce the final award seeking the court’s specific enforcement of certain confidential contractual rights the arbitrators decided in our favor bnsf moved to confirm the final award in the united states district court for the district of columbia but that requested relief was ultimately denied and dismissed as moot during the first quarter 2020 we recorded an 82 million pretax charge resulting from an adjusted calculation of the revenue divisions owed to bnsf under the final award on july 21 2020 the arkansas federal court granted our motion in part entering a judgment confirming the arbitration awards in a sealed opinion the court denied our request for additional enforcement relief but did not foreclose our right to pursue postconfirmation enforcement in court or in arbitration if warranted we have filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit seeking review of the arkansas federal court’s denial

 

we are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following

 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment

 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type for 2018 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and selfinsured for 100000 per workers’ compensation claim for 2019 and 2020 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for workers’ compensation claims for nearly all states we have policies in place for 2021 with substantially the same terms as our 2020 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage

 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2020 we had an accrual of approximately 257 million for estimated claims in addition we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of selfinsurance levels on covered claims at december 31 2020 we have recorded 304 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims other insurance deposits and prepaid insurance premiums

 

revenue equipment 

 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2020

 

 

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense

 

revenue recognition 

 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services accordingly we serve as a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for selection of thirdparty transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements

 

we recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided with related expenses recognized as incurred accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period

 

our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables are recorded at amounts billed to customers when loads are delivered or services are performed the allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated over the life of the underlying receivable and is based on historical experience any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts each applied to segregated risk pools based on the business segment that generated the receivable the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision

 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies

  

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year

 

  

2020 compared with 2019 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 51 to 964 billion in 2020 compared to 917 billion in 2019 primarily due to increased ics revenue per load the december 2019 acquisition and new contractual business onboarded throughout 2020 in fms and increased load volumes in jbt and dcs the increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in jbi revenue per load fuel surcharge revenues decreased 274 to 757 million in 2020 compared to 104 billion in 2019 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2020 revenue increased 93 over 2019

 

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2020 consolidated operating expenses increased 58 from 2019 while yearoveryear revenue increased 51 resulting in a 2020 operating ratio of 926 compared to 920 in 2019

 

rents and purchased transportation costs increased 94 in 2020 primarily due to increased load volume and thirdparty rail and truck purchased transportation rates in jbi and ics and an increase in the use of thirdparty truck carriers by fms and jbt during 2020 partially offset by jbi 2019 rail purchased transportation costs including a 268 million charge resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 83 in 2020 from 2019 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to a tighter supply of qualified drivers and an increase in the number of employees as well as higher cost of employee group medical benefits compared to 2019 in addition 2020 included a 123 million onetime covid19 related bonus paid to employee drivers and other key field personnel depreciation and amortization expense increased 57 in 2020 primarily due to equipment purchases related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and the addition of standard and specialized trailing equipment within our jbi segment

 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 228 in 2020 compared with 2019 due primarily to a decrease in the price of fuel during 2020 we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense

 

operating supplies and expenses were virtually flat in 2020 compared with 2019 driven primarily by higher operating supplies and building maintenance costs in response to covid19 increased toll costs and higher equipment maintenance costs offset by reduced travel and entertainment expenses general and administrative expenses decreased 62 from 2019 primarily due to decreased professional fees lower advertising costs lower driver hiring expenses and decreased net loss from the sale or disposal of assets partially offset by increased technology spend on the jb hunt 360° platform and legacy system upgrades higher bad debt expenses and increased building rental expenses additionally net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 44 million in 2020 compared to net losses of 131 million in 2019 insurance and claims expense decreased 145 in 2020 primarily due to the absence of a 20 million fms claim settlement charge and 174 million in reserve charges in 2019 for arbitration related legal fees cost and interest claimed by bnsf partially offset by an increase in insurance premiums in 2020

 

net interest expense for 2020 decreased by 110 compared with 2019 due to lower effective interest rates on our debt income tax expense decreased 28 in 2020 due primarily to decreased taxable earnings in 2020 our effective income tax rate was 240 in 2020 and 242 in 2019

  

 

segments 

 

we operated five business segments during calendar year 2020 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

 

  

  

   

 

operating data by segment 

 

  

  

 

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue decreased 1 to 468 billion in 2020 from 474 billion in 2019 this decrease in revenue was primarily a result of a 3 decrease in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 2 increase in load volume eastern network load volumes decreased 1 and transcontinental loads increased 4 compared to 2019 average length of haul increased 1 in 2020 when compared to 2019 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 1 compared to 2019

 

operating income of the jbi segment decreased to 428 million in 2020 from 447 million in 2019 benefits from increased load volume in 2020 were more than offset by higher rail purchased transportation costs covid19 related network inefficiencies higher personnel costs which included a onetime covid19 related bonus paid to employee drivers and other key field personnel and higher dray costs resulting from disruptions in rail capacity and a constricted labor and truck capacity environment operating income for jbi in 2019 was impacted by a 268 million charge to rail purchase transportation expense resulting from the issuance of a final award regarding our arbitration with bnsf and a 174 million charge to insurance and claims expense for arbitration related legal fees cost and interest claimed by bnsf

 

dcs segment 

 

dcs segment revenue increased 3 to 220 billion in 2020 from 213 billion in 2019 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week remained flat when compared to 2019 productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 2 from 2019 the increase in productivity was primarily a result of better utilization of assets between customer accounts contracted customer rate increases and increased customer supply chain fluidity customer retention rates remain above 98

 

operating income of our dcs segment increased to 314 million in 2020 from 278 million in 2019 the increase is primarily due to increased fleet productivity the absence of significant new customer implementation costs throughout the majority of the year lower driver related turnover costs and lower travel and entertainment expenses operating income was partially offset by higher nondriver personnel costs a onetime covid19 related bonus and higher equipment ownership costs when compared to 2019

 

ics segment 

 

ics segment revenue increased 23 to 166 billion in 2020 from 135 billion in 2019 overall volumes increased 2 with truckload volumes increasing 15 when compared to 2019 revenue per load increased 21 when compared to 2019 primarily due to customer mix changes and higher spot and contractual pricing contractual business was approximately 60 of the total load volume and 43 of the total revenue in the 2020 compared to 65 of the total load volume and 49 of the total revenue in 2019

 

ics segment incurred an operating loss of 45 million in 2020 compared to operating loss of 11 million in 2019 the increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower gross profit margins and increased technology spending as the marketplace for jb hunt 360° continues to expand in functionality and capacity gross profit margin decreased to 99 in the current year versus 131 last year primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment and constricted supply dynamics compared to 2019 approximately 114 billion of ics revenue for 2020 was executed through the marketplace for jb hunt 360° compared to 840 million in 2019 ics’s carrier base increased 19 and the employee count decreased 17 when compared to 2019

 

fms segment 

 

fms revenue increased 22 to 689 million in 2020 from 567 million in 2019 primarily due to two business acquisitions completed in 2019 and an increase in new customer contracts throughout 2020 partially offset by the temporary suspension of operations at various customer sites in 2020 as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic stop count for 2020 increased 30 and productivity defined as revenue per stop decreased 7 compared to 2019 the reduction in productivity was primarily due to a change in the mix of service methods to a more assetlight model resulting from the 2019 business acquisitions and a shift in the mix of services provided during 2020 as customers were affected by covid19 within our fms network

 

 

fms segment had an operating loss of 1 million in 2020 compared to an operating loss of 9 million in 2019 the current period operating loss was primarily due to increased costs to expand and improve through service quality performance controls the fms network lost revenue resulting from the temporary suspension of operations at several customer sites in response to covid19 higher bad debt expense higher personnel costs which included a onetime covid19 related bonus higher covid19 related operating supplies expense an increase in noncash amortization expense attributable to the 2019 business acquisitions fms segment operating loss for 2019 included a 20 million insurance claim settlement charge

 

jbt segment 

 

jbt segment revenue increased 19 to 463 million in 2020 from 389 million in 2019 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2020 increased 23 compared to 2019 primarily due to a 17 increase in load volume and a 5 increase in revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue per load compared to 2019 the 2020 growth in load count was partially due to the continued expansion of 360box which leverages the jb hunt 360° platform at the end of 2020 jbt operated 1769 tractors and 8567 trailers compared to 1831 and 6975 at the end of 2019

 

jbt segment had operating income of 17 million in 2020 compared with 29 million in 2019 the decrease in operating income was driven primarily by higher purchased transportation expense and higher nondriver personnel cost and technology modernization expenses for the continued expansion of 360box compared to 2019

 

2019 compared with 2018 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 64 to 917 billion in 2019 compared to 861 billion in 2018 primarily due to increased revenue in dcs related to an increase in revenue producing trucks higher truck productivity defined as revenue per truck per week and an acquisition in the first quarter 2019 the increase in revenue was further attributable to increased load volumes in ics and higher revenue per load in jbi partially offset by a decrease in jbi load volumes and a reduction in rates per loaded mile and the number of operating tractors in jbt fuel surcharge revenues decreased 14 to 104 billion in 2019 compared to 106 billion in 2018 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2019 revenue increased 75 over 2018

 

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2019 consolidated operating expenses increased 63 from 2018 while yearoveryear revenue increased 64 resulting in a 2019 operating ratio of 920 compared to 921 in 2018

 

rents and purchased transportation costs increased 21 in 2019 primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates within jbi and ics segments and jbi rail purchased transportation costs including a 268 million charge in 2019 resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf the current year increase in rents and purchased transportation costs was partially offset by a 1523 million bnsf arbitration related charge recorded by jbi in 2018 salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 125 in 2019 from 2018 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers depreciation and amortization expense increased 145 in 2019 primarily due to equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts

 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 09 in 2019 compared with 2018 due primarily to an increase in road miles partially offset by a decrease in the price of fuel during 2019 operating supplies and expenses increased 97 driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance and tire expenses due to increased equipment counts increased toll costs higher travel costs and higher facility maintenance expenses general and administrative expenses increased 176 from 2018 primarily due to increased technology spend on the jb hunt 360° platform and legacy system upgrades higher fms network facility costs and increased advertising expenses additionally net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 131 million in 2019 compared to net losses of 121 million in 2018 insurance and claims expense increased 215 in 2019 primarily due to 2019 including a 174 million reserve charge for arbitration related legal fees costs and interest claimed by bnsf and the inclusion of a 200 million fms claim charge within dcs partially offset by 2018 including specific reserve charges for the settlement of lawsuits with current and former drivers

 

net interest expense for 2019 increased by 317 compared with 2018 due to an increase in average debt levels and higher effective interest rates on our debt

 

our effective income tax rate was 242 in 2019 and 236 in 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in discreet tax benefits recognized related to sharebased compensation vesting partially offset by favorable settlements of state income tax audits during 2019

 

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue increased 1 to 474 billion in 2019 from 472 billion in 2018 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 4 increase in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 3 decrease in load volume eastern network load volumes decreased 9 and transcontinental loads increased 1 compared to 2018 average length of haul increased 2 in 2019 when compared to 2018 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 6 compared to 2018

 

operating income of the jbi segment increased to 447 million in 2019 from 401 million in 2018 benefits from customer rate increases and freight mix were partially offset by decreased volumes which includes volume lost to rail rationalization increased rail purchased transportation costs higher equipment ownership and maintenance costs increased technology modernization expenses lower box turns higher box repositioning costs and increased driver wages and recruiting costs current year operating income was further impacted by a 268 million charge to rail purchase transportation expense resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf and a 174 million charge to insurance and claims expense for arbitration related legal fees costs and interest claimed by bnsf jbi recorded 1523 million of additional bnsf arbitration related charges in 2018 excluding these 2018 charges and the 2019 arbitration related charges of 442 million operating income for 2019 decreased 11 when compared to 2018

 

dcs segment 

 

dcs segment revenue increased 19 to 213 billion in 2019 from 179 billion in 2018 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week increased 2 when compared to 2018 productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 3 from 2018 the increase in productivity was primarily a result of better integration of assets between customer accounts customer rate increases and increased customer supply chain fluidity during 2019 compared to 2018 dcs ended 2019 with a net additional 850 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2018 approximately 69 of these additions represent private fleet conversion customer retention rates for 2019 remained above 98

 

 

operating income of our dcs segment increased to 278 million in 2019 from 195 million in 2018 the increase is primarily due to increased productivity and additional trucks under contract partially offset by increased driver wages and recruiting costs higher nondriver personnel costs and higher equipment ownership costs compared to 2018

 

ics segment 

 

ics segment revenue increased 1 to 135 billion in 2019 from 133 billion in 2018 overall volumes increased 1 revenue per load remained flat when compared to 2018 primarily due to customer mix changes a lower spot pricing market and a competitive pricing environment for contractual truckload business when compared to 2018 contractual business was approximately 71 of the total load volume and 59 of the total revenue in the 2019 compared to 70 of the total load volume and 48 of the total revenue in 2018

 

ics segment incurred an operating loss of 11 million in 2019 compared to operating income of 50 million in 2018 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower gross profit margins increased expenses to expand capacity and functionality of the marketplace for jb hunt 360° higher personnel costs and increased digital marketing expenses gross profit margin decreased to 131 in the current year versus 154 last year primarily due to weaker spot market activity and lower contractual rates on committed business compared to 2018 approximately 840 million of ics revenue for 2019 was executed through the marketplace for jb hunt 360° compared to 558 million in 2018 ics’s carrier base increased 15 and the employee count increased 6 when compared to 2018

 

fms segment 

 

fms revenue increased 51 to 567 million in 2019 from 375 million in 2018 primarily due to the business acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2019 and an increase in new customer contracts throughout 2019 stop count for 2019 increased 105 while productivity defined as revenue per stop decreased 26 compared to 2018 the reduction in productivity was primarily due to a change in the mix of service methods to a more assetlight model resulting from the 2019 business acquisition

 

fms segment had an operating loss of 9 million in 2019 compared to an operating loss of 2 million in 2018 the benefit of increased revenue was more than offset by higher insurance and claims costs which included a 20 million insurance claim charge in 2019 higher costs from the expanded fms network and additional noncash amortization expense of 38 million compared to 2018

 

jbt segment 

 

jbt segment revenue decreased 7 to 389 million in 2019 from 417 million in 2018 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2019 decreased 6 compared to 2018 primarily due to a 1 decrease in rates per loaded mile a 3 decrease in length of haul and a 2 decrease in load volumes compared to 2018 at the end of 2019 jbt operated 1831 tractors compared to 2112 at the end of 2018

 

jbt segment had operating income of 29 million in 2019 compared with 37 million in 2018 the decrease in operating income was driven primarily by lower spot market activity higher empty miles per load increased driver wages and recruiting costs and the reduction in overall load volumes

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

net cash provided by operating activities remained virtually flat totaling 112 billion in 2020 compared to 110 billion in 2019 due to the timing of general working capital activities offset by the decrease in earnings

 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 613 million in 2020 compared with 804 million in 2019 the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in equipment purchases net of proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2020 and from 2019 including the completion of two business acquisitions

 

net cash used in financing activities was 232 million in 2020 compared with 267 million in 2019 this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in treasury stock purchased in 2020 in addition net cash used in financing activities for 2019 included the full retirement of our 250 million of 240 senior notes that matured in march 2019 partially offset by our issuance of 700 million of 3875 senior notes due march 2026

 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 024 per share quarterly dividend in 2018 a 026 per share quarterly dividend in 2019 and a 027 per share quarterly dividend in 2020 on january 21 2021 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 027 to 028 per share which was paid february 19 2021 to stockholders of record on february 5 2021 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid

  

liquidity 

 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers and chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment as well as periodic business acquisitions we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements or other capital expenditures depending on market and overall economic conditions during 2020 we postponed a portion of our equipment purchases in order to increase our available cash in light of the economic disruption and uncertainty resulting from covid19 in recent years we have obtained capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment during the fourth quarter of 2020 we completed a business acquisition see note 12 acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion we used our existing cash to finance this transaction and to provide any necessary liquidity for current and future operations

 

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future should covid19 related economic conditions warrant we believe we have sufficient credit resources available to meet our near and longterm operating and capital needs at december 31 2020 we had a cash balance of 313 million and we had no outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit which authorizes us to borrow up to 750 million under a senior revolving line of credit and is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks that expires in september 2023 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees

 

we are continually evaluating the possible effects of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts on operational cash flows including the risks of declines in the overall freight market and our customers liquidity and ability to pay we regularly monitor working capital and maintain frequent communication with our customers suppliers and service providers during 2020 operational cost reduction activities consisted primarily of canceling nonessential travel and hiring activities and the delay of other discretionary spending which we will continue to do as necessary a large portion of our cost structure is variable purchased transportation expense represents more than half of our total costs but is heavily tied to load volumes our second largest cost item is salaries and wages the largest portion of which is driver pay which includes a large variable component currently we have made no adjustments to our costs that we consider more fixed in nature however we continue to monitor the environment and are prepared to adjust if necessary

 

 

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first is 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 which was issued in march 2014 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning september 2014 the second is 350 million of 330 senior notes due august 2022 issued in august 2015 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year beginning february 2016 the third is 700 million of 3875 senior notes due march 2026 issued in march 2019 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning september 2019 we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively convert our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to a variable rate resulting in an interest rates of 158 at december 31 2020 the applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on libor plus an established margin

 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2020 we were well above compliance with all covenants and financial ratios and we fully intend and expect to emerge from the current covid19 related economic environment with our investmentgrade rating intact

 

we are currently committed to spend a total of approximately 112 billion net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2021 and 2022 which is primarily related to the acquisition of tractors containers chassis and other trailing equipment

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements other than our net purchase commitments of 112 billion as of december 31 2020

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2020

 

   

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2020

 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 38 million at december 31 2020 that expire at various dates in 2021 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 717 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 330 to 3875 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to a variable rate the applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 35 million

 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2020 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the factors outlined previously in this form 10k regarding forwardlooking statements and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks

 

our business is significantly impacted by economic conditions customer business cycles and seasonal factors 

 

our business is dependent on the freight shipping needs of our customers which can be heavily impacted by economic conditions and other factors affecting their businesses recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers may substantially reduce freight volumes for which our customers need transportation services and lead to excess capacity in the industry and resulting pressure on the rates we are able to obtain for our services adverse economic conditions may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the bnsf and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth

 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2019 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

 

 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2020 with substantially the same terms as our 2019 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected

 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2019 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 32 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve longterm written contracts those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot fmcsa and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations our failure to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations to which we are subject whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments further these agencies could institute new laws rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time compliance with new laws rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services

 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services

 

 

a determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs  

  

federal and state legislation as well as tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors an example of such legislation recently enacted in california is currently under a judicial stay with respect to trucking companies while a legal challenge to the law is pending there can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that reclassifies independent contractors to be employees if our independent contractors are determined to be our employees that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax workers’ compensation unemployment benefits labor employment and tort laws as well as our potential liability for employee benefits in addition such changes may be applied retroactively and if so we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results

 

we may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures 

 

we by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation including personal injury claims vehicular collisions and accidents alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws such as classaction lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay commercial and contract disputes cargo loss and property damage claims while we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance we accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation its likelihood of success and an evaluation of the possible range of loss our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth we have also invested significantly in the development of our marketplace for jb hunt 360 online freight matching platform through which we are generating an increasing amount of revenue each of our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation

 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins

 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services

  

 

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs

 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change compliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 

we are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change if current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

 

acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings 

 

we could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets personnel and operations with our own regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our operating costs acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks including without limitation the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies difficulties in maintaining controls procedures and policies potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees failure to realize expected efficiencies synergies and cost savings or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired

 

our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination many of which cannot be presently identified

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following

 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment

 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type for 2017 and 2018 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and selfinsured for 100000 per workers’ compensation claim for 2019 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for workers’ compensation claims for nearly all states we have policies in place for 2020 with substantially the same terms as our 2019 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage

 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2019 we had an accrual of approximately 263 million for estimated claims in addition we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of selfinsurance levels on covered claims at december 31 2019 we have recorded 281 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims other insurance deposits and prepaid insurance premiums

 

revenue equipment 

 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2019

 

 

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense

 

revenue recognition 

 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services accordingly we serve as a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for selection of thirdparty transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements

 

we recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided with related expenses recognized as incurred accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period

 

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision

 

the tax cuts and jobs act the act was enacted in december 2017 beginning in 2018 the act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 at december 31 2017 we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future which was generally 21 the provisional amount recorded resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was 3092 million which was included as a component of 2017 income tax from continuing operations during 2018 we finalized our calculations for our 2017 federal income tax return which was filed based on the law prior to the act resulting in no significant change to the initial measurement of these balances remaining aspects of the act were not relevant to our operations

 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies

  

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year

 

  

2019 compared with 2018 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 64 to 917 billion in 2019 compared to 861 billion in 2018 primarily due to increased revenue in dcs related to an increase in revenue producing trucks higher truck productivity defined as revenue per truck per week and an acquisition in the first quarter 2019 the increase in revenue was further attributable to increased load volumes in ics and higher revenue per load in jbi partially offset by a decrease in jbi load volumes and a reduction in rates per loaded mile and the number of operating tractors in jbt fuel surcharge revenues decreased 14 to 104 billion in 2019 compared to 106 billion in 2018 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2019 revenue increased 75 over 2018

 

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2019 consolidated operating expenses increased 63 from 2018 while yearoveryear revenue increased 64 resulting in a 2019 operating ratio of 920 compared to 921 in 2018

 

rents and purchased transportation costs increased 21 in 2019 primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates within jbi and ics segments and jbi rail purchased transportation costs including a 268 million charge in 2019 resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf the current year increase in rents and purchased transportation costs was partially offset by a 1523 million bnsf arbitration related charge recorded by jbi in 2018 salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 125 in 2019 from 2018 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers depreciation and amortization expense increased 145 in 2019 primarily due to equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts

 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 09 in 2019 compared with 2018 due primarily to an increase in road miles partially offset by a decrease in the price of fuel during 2019 we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense

 

operating supplies and expenses increased 97 driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance and tire expenses due to increased equipment counts increased toll costs higher travel costs and higher facility maintenance expenses general and administrative expenses increased 176 from 2018 primarily due to increased technology spend on the jb hunt 360 platform and legacy system upgrades higher final mile services ® fms network facility costs and increased advertising expenses additionally net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 131 million in 2019 compared to net losses of 121 million in 2018 insurance and claims expense increased 215 in 2019 primarily due to 2019 including a 174 million reserve charge for arbitration related legal fees costs and interest claimed by bnsf and the inclusion of a 200 million fms claim charge within dcs partially offset by 2018 including specific reserve charges for the settlement of lawsuits with current and former drivers

 

net interest expense for 2019 increased by 317 compared with 2018 due to an increase in average debt levels and higher effective interest rates on our debt

 

our effective income tax rate was 242 in 2019 and 236 in 2018 the increase in 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in discreet tax benefits recognized related to sharebased compensation vesting partially offset by favorable settlements of state income tax audits during 2019

  

 

segments 

 

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2019 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

 

  

  

   

  

operating data by segment 

  

    

 

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue increased 1 to 474 billion in 2019 from 472 billion in 2018 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 4 increase in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by a 3 decrease in load volume eastern network load volumes decreased 9 and transcontinental loads increased 1 compared to 2018 average length of haul increased 2 in 2019 when compared to 2018 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 6 compared to 2018

 

operating income of the jbi segment increased to 447 million in 2019 from 401 million in 2018 benefits from customer rate increases and freight mix were partially offset by decreased volumes which includes volume lost to rail rationalization increased rail purchased transportation costs higher equipment ownership and maintenance costs increased technology modernization expenses lower box turns higher box repositioning costs and increased driver wages and recruiting costs current year operating income was further impacted by a 268 million charge to rail purchase transportation expense resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with bnsf and a 174 million charge to insurance and claims expense for arbitration related legal fees costs and interest claimed by bnsf jbi recorded 1523 million of additional bnsf arbitration related charges in 2018 excluding these 2018 charges and the 2019 arbitration related charges of 442 million operating income for 2019 decreased 11 when compared to 2018

operating income of our dcs segment increased to 269 million in 2019 from 193 million in 2018 the increase is primarily due to increased productivity and additional trucks under contract partially offset by higher insurance and claims costs which included a 200 million fms claim charge in the second quarter 2019 higher costs from the expanded fms network increased driver wages and recruiting costs and additional noncash amortization expense of 38 million compared to 2018

 

ics segment 

 

ics segment revenue increased 1 to 135 billion in 2019 from 133 billion in 2018 overall volumes increased 1 revenue per load remained flat when compared to 2018 primarily due to customer mix changes a lower spot pricing market and a competitive pricing environment for contractual truckload business when compared to 2018 contractual business was approximately 71 of the total load volume and 59 of the total revenue in the 2019 compared to 70 of the total load volume and 48 of the total revenue in 2018

 

ics segment incurred an operating loss of 11 million in 2019 compared to operating income of 50 million in 2018 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower gross profit margins increased expenses to expand capacity and functionality of the marketplace for jb hunt 360 higher personnel costs and increased digital marketing expenses gross profit margin decreased to 131 in the current year versus 154 last year primarily due to weaker spot market activity and lower contractual rates on committed business compared to 2018 approximately 840 million of ics revenue for 2019 was executed through the marketplace for jb hunt 360 compared to 558 million in 2018 ics’s carrier base increased 15 and the employee count increased 6 when compared to 2018

 

 

jbt segment 

 

jbt segment revenue decreased 7 to 389 million in 2019 from 417 million in 2018 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2019 decreased 6 compared to 2018 primarily due to a 1 decrease in rates per loaded mile a 3 decrease in length of haul and a 2 decrease in load volumes compared to 2018 at the end of 2019 jbt operated 1831 tractors compared to 2112 at the end of 2018

 

jbt segment had operating income of 29 million in 2019 compared with 37 million in 2018 the decrease in operating income was driven primarily by lower spot market activity higher empty miles per load increased driver wages and recruiting costs and the reduction in overall load volumes

 

2018 compared with 2017 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 198 to 861 billion in 2018 compared to 719 billion in 2017 primarily due to overall increased load volume and higher revenue per load in all four of our segments fuel surcharge revenues increased 402 to 11 billion in 2018 compared to 754 million in 2017 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2018 revenue increased 174 over 2017

rents and purchased transportation costs increased 215 in 2018 primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume which increased services provided by thirdparty rail and truck carriers within jbi and ics segments in addition our jbi segment incurred charges of 1523 million to rail purchase transportation expense related to the arbitration with bnsf salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 198 in 2018 from 2017 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers depreciation and amortization expense increased 137 in 2018 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand and equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 321 in 2018 compared with 2017 due primarily to an increase in road miles and increases in the price of fuel during 2018 operating supplies and expenses increased 180 driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance and tire expenses due to increased equipment counts higher travel costs increased toll costs and higher building maintenance expenses general and administrative expenses increased 297 from 2017 primarily due to increased building and computer rentals higher professional fees higher advertising costs higher bad debt expense driven by a customer bankruptcy and increased net losses from asset sales and disposals partially offset by the 2017 inclusion of a 202 million reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery additionally net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 121 million in 2018 compared to net losses of 74 million in 2017 insurance and claims expense increased 47 in 2018 primarily due to higher incident volume

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue increased 15 to 472 billion in 2018 from 408 billion in 2017 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 2 increase in load volume and a 13 increase in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue eastern network loads grew at 10 and transcontinental loads decreased 2 compared to 2017 average length of haul decreased 2 in 2018 when compared to 2017 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 10 compared to 2017

 

operating income of the jbi segment decreased to 401 million in 2018 from 407 million in 2017 benefits from volume growth and increased revenue per load were offset by increases in rail purchased transportation costs which included 1523 million of additional expense related to the arbitration with bnsf benefits were further offset by higher driver wage and retention costs higher driver recruiting expenses higher outsourced dray costs increased costs for onboarding and integration of container tracking technologies higher equipment ownership costs and costs of reduced efficiency and disruptions within the rail network in addition 2017 included a 202 million expense for the reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery

liquidity and capital resources 

 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 110 billion in 2019 compared to 109 billion in 2018 this increase was primarily due to the increase in earnings partially offset by the timing of general working capital activities

 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 804 million in 2019 compared with 887 million in 2018 the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in equipment purchases net of proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2019 partially offset by the purchases of cory and rdi last mile co rdi which closed during the first and fourth quarters of 2019 respectively

 

net cash used in financing activities was 267 million in 2019 compared with 208 million in 2018 this increase resulted primarily from an increase in treasury stock purchased in 2019 partially offset by higher proceeds from longterm debt issuances net of longterm debt repayments

 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 023 per share quarterly dividend in 2017 a 024 per share quarterly dividend in 2018 and a 026 per share quarterly dividend in 2019 on january 22 2020 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 026 to 027 per share which will be paid february 21 2020 to stockholders of record on february 7 2020 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid

  

liquidity 

 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtain capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment during the first and fourth quarters of 2019 we completed two separate business acquisitions see note 12 acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion we used our existing revolving credit facility and cash to finance these transactions and to provide any necessary liquidity for current and future operations these acquisitions did not have a material impact on our interest expense

 

at december 31 2019 we were authorized to borrow up to 750 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in september 2023 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2019 we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement

 

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first is 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 which was issued in march 2014 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning september 2014 the second is 350 million of 330 senior notes due august 2022 issued in august 2015 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year beginning february 2016 the third is 700 million of 3875 senior notes due march 2026 issued in march 2019 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning september 2019 we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively convert our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to a variable rate resulting in an interest rates of 327 at december 31 2019 the applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on libor plus an established margin in addition we previously had 250 million of 240 senior notes which matured in march 2019 the entire outstanding balance was paid in full at maturity

 

 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2019

 

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future

 

we are currently committed to spend approximately 938 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2020 through 2021 which is primarily related to the acquisition of tractors containers chassis and other trailing equipment

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements other than our net purchase commitments of 938 million as of december 31 2019

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2019

 

   

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2019

 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 27 million at december 31 2019 that expire at various dates in 2020 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 554 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 330 to 3875 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to a variable rate the applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 35 million

 

 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2019 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

operating segments 

 

segment information is also included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements

 

jbi segment 

 

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company bnsf this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint service environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services drayage are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while thirdparty dray carriers are used where economical by performing our own drayage services we are able to provide a costcompetitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers

 

jbi operates 88739 pieces of companyowned trailing equipment systemwide the fleet primarily consists of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality we own and maintain our own chassis fleet consisting of 81442 units the containers and chassis are uniquely designed so that they may only be paired together which we feel creates an operational competitive advantage jbi also manages a fleet of 5017 companyowned tractors 633 independent contractor trucks and 6208 company drivers at december 31 2018 the total jbi employee count was 7081 revenue for the jbi segment in 2018 was 472 billion

  

 

 

dcs segment 

 

dcs focuses on private fleet conversion and creation in replenishment specialized equipment and finalmile delivery services we specialize in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions that support a variety of transportation networks our finalmile delivery services are supported with a network of approximately 102 crossdock and other delivery system network locations nationwide with 98 of the continental us population living within 150 miles of a network location contracts with our customers are longterm ranging from three to 10 years with the average being approximately five years pricing of our contracts typically involves costplus arrangements with our fixed costs being recovered regardless of equipment utilization but is customized based on invested capital and duration

 

at december 31 2018 this segment operated 9652 companyowned trucks 412 customerowned trucks and 51 independent contractor trucks dcs also operates 20344 owned pieces of trailing equipment and 6366 customerowned trailers the dcs segment employed 13747 people including 11331 drivers at december 31 2018 dcs revenue for 2018 was 216 billion

 

ics segment 

 

ics provides traditional freight brokerage and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers desiring to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates 44 remote sales offices or branches as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers

 

at december 31 2018 the ics segment employed 1142 people with a carrier base of approximately 73100 ics revenue for 2018 was 133 billion

 

jbt segment 

 

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers

 

at december 31 2018 the jbt segment operated 1139 companyowned tractors and employed 1440 people 1200 of whom were drivers at december 31 2018 we had 973 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment jbt revenue for 2018 was 417 million

 

marketing and operations 

 

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts agricultural products electronics and chemicals our customers’ business activities are extremely diverse and our customer base includes a large number of fortune 500 companies we provide a broad range of transportation services to shippers seeking to use a variety of transportation options to optimize their supplychain logistics needs

 

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided

  

 

 

people 

 

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2018 we had 27621 employees which consisted of 18739 company drivers 7589 office personnel and 1293 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1657 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements

 

revenue equipment 

 

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our jbt segment operates primarily 53foot dryvan trailers

 

as of december 31 2018 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 15808 units in addition we had 1657 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2018 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 23 years while our containers averaged 64 years of age and our trailers averaged 63 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities

 

competition and the industry 

 

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country

 

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services

 

regulation 

 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries we are also subject to a variety of requirements of national state and local governments including the us environmental protection agency and the occupational safety and health administration

 

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks

 

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control in addition to general us economic trends and to a lesser extent global economic trends these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads rail service delays disruptions to us portofcall activity significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries or license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions disruption or failure of information technology systems increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment volatile financial credit markets operational disruption or adverse effects of business acquisitions and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers

 

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the bnsf and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

in january 2017 we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1 2016 as well as to clarify other issues under our joint service agreement with bnsf bnsf requested the same and the arbitration process is ongoing on october 5 2018 we received the arbitrators’ interim award the details of the interim award are confidential and require the parties to submit additional information requested by the arbitrators to decide certain unresolved matters for the determined components of the interim award we recorded an 183 million pretax charge in the third quarter 2018 related to certain charges claimed by bnsf for specific services requested for customers from april 2014 through may 2018 on december 7 2018 the arbitrators’ issued their clarified interim award of october 5 2018 resulting from some of the parties’ additional submissions to the panel regarding certain issues related to determining the revenue division between the parties on january 11 2019 the panel issued its second interim award ordering that 894 million is due from the company to bnsf resulting from the adjusted revenue divisions relating to the 2016 period at issue 521 million and for calendar year 2017 373 million the parties have been instructed to make further submissions on the revenue divisions for calendar year 2018 and going forward as well as other confidential issues raised during the arbitration process so that the panel can issue an appropriate interim andor final award regarding all issues raised during the proceeding we recorded pretax charges for contingent liabilities in the fourth quarter 2018 of 894 million claimed by the bnsf for the period may 1 2016 through december 31 2017 and 446 million for the period january 1 2018 through december 31 2018 for a total of 134 million

 

the other financial implications from the interim award and the clarified interim award will not be fully determined until the arbitrators issue additional awards following their review of each party’s requested additional submissions at this time we are unable to reasonably predict the final outcome of the arbitration and as such no further gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded if decided adversely this matter could result in a liability material to our financial condition or results of operations bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment normal commercial business activity between the parties including load tendering load tracing billing and payments is expected to continue on a timely basis

 

 

 

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth

 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2018 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2019 with substantially the same terms as our 2018 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage with the exception of decreasing our selfinsured portion of workers’ compensation claims to zero for nearly all states we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected

 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2018 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 30 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve longterm written contracts those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results

 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot fmcsa and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations our failure to comply with any applicable laws rules or regulations to which we are subject whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments further these agencies could institute new laws rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time compliance with new laws rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services

 

 

 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services

 

a determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs 

  

tax and other regulatory authorities often seek to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors there can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that reclassifies independent contractors to be employees if our independent contractors are determined to be our employees that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax workers’ compensation unemployment benefits labor employment and tort laws as well as our potential liability for employee benefits in addition such changes may be applied retroactively and if so we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results

 

we may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures 

 

we by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation including personal injury claims vehicular collisions and accidents alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws such as classaction lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay commercial and contract disputes cargo loss and property damage claims while we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance we accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation its likelihood of success and an evaluation of the possible range of loss our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation

 

 

 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins

 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services

  

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs

 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 

acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings 

 

we could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets personnel and operations with our own regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our operating costs acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks including without limitation the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies difficulties in maintaining controls procedures and policies potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees failure to realize expected efficiencies synergies and cost savings or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired

 

our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination many of which cannot be presently identified

in january 2017 we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1 2016 as well as to clarify other issues under our joint service agreement with bnsf bnsf requested the same and the arbitration process is ongoing on october 5 2018 we received the arbitrators’ interim award the details of the interim award are confidential and require the parties to submit additional information requested by the arbitrators to decide certain unresolved matters for the determined components of the interim award we recorded an 183 million pretax charge in the third quarter 2018 related to certain charges claimed by bnsf for specific services requested for customers from april 2014 through may 2018 on december 7 2018 the arbitrators’ issued their clarified interim award of october 5 2018 resulting from some of the parties’ additional submissions to the panel regarding certain issues related to determining the revenue division between the parties on january 11 2019 the panel issued its second interim award ordering that 894 million is due from the company to bnsf resulting from the adjusted revenue divisions relating to the 2016 period at issue 521 million and for calendar year 2017 373 million the parties have been instructed to make further submissions on the revenue divisions for calendar year 2018 and going forward as well as other confidential issues raised during the arbitration process so that the panel can issue an appropriate interim andor final award regarding all issues raised during the proceeding we recorded pretax charges for contingent liabilities in the fourth quarter 2018 of 894 million claimed by the bnsf for the period may 1 2016 through december 31 2017 and 446 million for the period january 1 2018 through december 31 2018 for a total of 134 million

 

the other financial implications from the interim award and the clarified interim award will not be fully determined until the arbitrators issue additional awards following their review of each party’s requested additional submissions at this time we are unable to reasonably predict the final outcome of the arbitration and as such no further gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded if decided adversely this matter could result in a liability material to our financial condition or results of operations bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment normal commercial business activity between the parties including load tendering load tracing billing and payments is expected to continue on a timely basis

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following

 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment

 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type we have policies in place for 2019 with substantially the same terms as our 2018 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage with the exception of decreasing our selfinsured portion of workers’ compensation claims to zero for nearly all states

 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2018 we had an accrual of approximately 260 million for estimated claims in addition we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of selfinsurance levels on covered claims at december 31 2018 we have recorded 261 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims other insurance deposits and prepaid insurance premiums

 

revenue equipment 

 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2018

 

 

 

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

 

revenue recognition 

 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services accordingly we serve as a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for selection of thirdparty transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements

 

we recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided with related expenses recognized as incurred accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period

 

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision

 

the tax cuts and jobs act the act was enacted in december 2017 beginning in 2018 the act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 at december 31 2017 we made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future which was generally 21 the provisional amount recorded resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was 3092 million which was included as a component of 2017 income tax from continuing operations during 2018 we finalized our calculations for our 2017 federal income tax return which was filed based on the law prior to the act resulting in no significant change to the initial measurement of these balances remaining aspects of the act were not relevant to our operations

 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies

  

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year

 

  

2018 compared with 2017 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 198 to 861 billion in 2018 compared to 719 billion in 2017 primarily due to overall increased load volume and higher revenue per load in all four of our segments fuel surcharge revenues increased 402 to 11 billion in 2018 compared to 754 million in 2017 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2018 revenue increased 174 over 2017

 

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2018 consolidated operating expenses increased 208 from 2017 while yearoveryear revenue increased 198 resulting in a 2018 operating ratio of 921 compared to 913 in 2017 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 215 in 2018 primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume which increased services provided by thirdparty rail and truck carriers within jbi and ics segments in addition our jbi segment incurred charges of 1523 million to rail purchase transportation expense related to the ongoing arbitration with bnsf salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 198 in 2018 from 2017 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 321 in 2018 compared with 2017 due primarily to an increase in road miles and increases in the price of fuel during 2018 we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly

 

 

 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense

 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 137 in 2018 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand and equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts

 

operating supplies and expenses increased 180 driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance and tire expenses due to increased equipment counts higher travel costs increased toll costs and higher building maintenance expenses general and administrative expenses increased 297 from 2017 primarily due to increased building and computer rentals higher professional fees higher advertising costs higher bad debt expense driven by a customer bankruptcy and increased net losses from asset sales and disposals partially offset by the 2017 inclusion of a 202 million reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery additionally net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 121 million in 2018 compared to net losses of 74 million in 2017 insurance and claims expense increased 47 in 2018 primarily due to higher incident volume

 

net interest expense for 2018 increased by 408 compared with 2017 due to an increase in average debt levels higher effective interest rates on our debt and expenses incurred to refinance our revolving line of credit compared to 2017

 

our effective income tax rate was 236 in 2018 and 1529 in 2017 the increase in 2018 was primarily due to a 3092 million decrease in income tax expense in 2017 resulting from adjustments to our deferred tax balances at december 31 2017 for the change in future tax rates prescribed by the tax cuts and jobs act

 

 

 

segments 

 

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2018 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

  

   

 

 

operating data by segment 

  

  

  

 

 

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue increased 15 to 472 billion in 2018 from 408 billion in 2017 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of a 2 increase in load volume and a 13 increase in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue eastern network loads grew at 10 and transcontinental loads decreased 2 compared to 2017 average length of haul decreased 2 in 2018 when compared to 2017 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 10 compared to 2017

 

operating income of the jbi segment decreased to 401 million in 2018 from 407 million in 2017 benefits from volume growth and increased revenue per load were offset by increases in rail purchased transportation costs which included 1523 million of additional expense related to the ongoing arbitration with bnsf benefits where further offset by higher driver wage and retention costs higher driver recruiting expenses higher outsourced dray costs increased costs for onboarding and integration of container tracking technologies higher equipment ownership costs and costs of reduced efficiency and disruptions within the rail network in addition 2017 included a 202 million expense for the reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that did not meet delivery

jbt segment had operating income of 37 million in 2018 compared with 23 million in 2017 the increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher rates per loaded mile and lower equipment ownership costs partially offset by increased driver wage and retention costs higher driver and independent contractor recruiting expenses and higher independent contractor costs per mile

 

2017 compared with 2016 

  

consolidated operating revenues

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtain capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment

 

in september 2018 we replaced our 500 million senior revolving credit facility dated september 2015 with a new credit facility authorizing us to borrow up to 750 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires september 2023 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2018 we had 309 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 347 under this agreement

 

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first and second issuances are 250 million of 240 senior notes due march 2019 and 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 respectively both of which were issued in march 2014 interest payments under both notes are due semiannually in march and september of each year the third issuance is 350 million of 330 senior notes due august 2022 issued in august 2015 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year we may redeem for cash some or all of these notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates resulting in interest rates of 363 and 397 respectively at december 31 2018 the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin for our senior notes maturing in 2019 it is our intent to pay the entire outstanding balances in full on or before the maturity dates using our existing senior revolving line of credit or other sources of longterm financing in addition we have a shelf registration filed with the sec and may draw upon it as warranted

 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2018

 

 

 

as previously mentioned above the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted in december 2017 beginning in 2018 the act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 which had a positive effect on our overall liquidity

 

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future

 

we are currently committed to spend approximately 3816 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2019 and 2020 which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers chassis and tractors

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

in addition to our net purchase commitments of 3816 million our only other offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2018 we had approximately 1178 million of obligations primarily related to facility leases

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2018

 

   

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2018

 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 13 million at december 31 2018 that expire at various dates in 2019 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 568 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 240 to 385 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 91 million

 

 

 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2018 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

as always we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all of our operations as safely as possible 

 

operating segments 

 

segment information is also included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

jbi segment 

 

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint service environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services drayage are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while thirdparty dray carriers are used where economical by performing our own drayage services we are able to provide a costcompetitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers 

 

 

 

jbi operates 88610 pieces of companyowned trailing equipment systemwide the fleet primarily consists of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality we own and maintain our own chassis fleet consisting of 77946 units the containers and chassis are uniquely designed so that they may only be paired together which we feel creates an operational competitive advantage jbi also manages a fleet of 4776 companyowned tractors 764 independent contractor trucks and 5782 company drivers at december 31 2017 the total jbi employee count was 6555 revenue for the jbi segment in 2017 was 408 billion 

  

dcs segment 

 

dcs focuses on private fleet conversion and creation in replenishment specialized equipment and finalmile delivery services we specialize in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions that support a variety of transportation networks our finalmile delivery services are supported with a network of approximately 102 crossdock and other delivery system network locations nationwide with 98 of the continental us population living within 150 miles of a network location contracts with our customers are longterm ranging from three to 10 years with the average being approximately five years pricing of our contracts typically involves costplus arrangements with our fixed costs being recovered regardless of equipment utilization but is customized based on invested capital and duration 

 

at december 31 2017 this segment operated 8124 companyowned trucks 544 customerowned trucks and 59 independent contractor trucks dcs also operates 18579 owned pieces of trailing equipment and 7232 customerowned trailers the dcs segment employed 12099 people including 10007 drivers at december 31 2017 dcs revenue for 2017 was 172 billion 

 

ics segment 

 

ics provides traditional freight brokerage and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers desiring to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates 44 remote sales offices or branches as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers 

 

at december 31 2017 the ics segment employed 954 people with a carrier base of approximately 56700 ics revenue for 2017 was 102 billion 

 

jbt segment 

 

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers

 

at decem ber 31 2017 the jbt segment operated 1291 companyowned tractors and employed 1492 people 1255 of whom were drivers at december 31 2017 we had 741 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment jbt revenue for 2017 was 378 million 

 

marketing and operations 

 

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts agricultural products electronics and chemicals our customers’ business activities are extremely diverse and our customer base includes a large number of fortune 500 companies we provide a broad range of transportation services to shippers seeking to use a variety of transportation options to optimize their supplychain logistics needs 

 

 

 

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

  

people 

 

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2017 we had 24681 employees which consisted of 17044 company drivers 6454 office personnel and 1183 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1564 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

 

revenue equipment 

 

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks  and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our jbt segment operates primarily 53foot dryvan trailers 

 

as of december 31 201 7 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 14191 units in addition we had 1564 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2017 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 29 years while our containers averaged 62 years of age and our trailers averaged 71 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities 

 

competition and the industry 

 

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

 

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services 

 

regulation 

 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

 

 

 

in 2013 the remaining provisions of the fmcsa’s amendment to the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers became effective and we experienced some negative impact on our productivity as a result however in december 2014 as a result of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 the fmcsa was required to rescind the 34hour restart provision of the amended hos rules to the prejuly 1 2013 requirements furthermore the fmcsa was required to conduct a field study measuring the safety benefit of the amended hos rules before and after this rule change this rule rescission is considered temporary pending the outcome of the study which remains uncompleted we continue to evaluate and adjust the various segments of our operations toward the ultimate impact of these changes in hos safety requirements 

 

in december 2015 the fmcsa published a final rule requiring use of an electronic logging device eld by december 2017 for nearly all carriers we have successfully implemented eld’s within our fleets 

 

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

 

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control in addition to general us economic trends and to a lesser extent global economic trends these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads rail service delays disruptions to us portofcall activity significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries or license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions disruption or failure of information technology systems increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment volatile financial credit markets operational disruption or adverse effects of business acquisitions and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

 

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the bnsf railway company bnsf and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

in january 2017 we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1 2016 as well as to clarify other issues under our joint service agreement with bnsf bnsf has requested the same and the arbitration process has commenced bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment at this time we are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the arbitration and as such no gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded normal commercial business activity between the parties including load tendering load tracing billing and payments has continued and is expected to continue on a timely basis 

 

 

 

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2017 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

 

i nsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2018 with substantially the same terms as our 2017 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2017 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 29 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve longterm written contracts those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot fmcsa and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

 

 

 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

 

we may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures 

 

we by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation including personal injury claims vehicular collisions and accidents labor and employment commercial and contract disputes cargo loss and property damage claims while we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance we accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation its likelihood of success and an evaluation of the possible range of loss our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse on our financial results 

 

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation 

 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins 

 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

  

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes  and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

 

 

 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

 

acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings 

 

we could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets personnel and operations with our own regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business distract our management and employees and increase our operating costs acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks including without limitation the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies difficulties in maintaining controls procedures and policies potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees failure to realize expected efficiencies synergies and cost savings or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired 

 

our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination many of which cannot be presently identified

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

we are a defendant in certain classaction lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are current and former californiabased drivers who allege claims for unpaid wages failure to provide meal and rest periods and other items   during the first half of 2014 the district court in the lead classaction granted judgment in our favor with regard to all claims the plaintiffs appealed the case to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in july 2017 the ninth circuit issued a memorandum decision vacating the judgment in our favor and remanding the case to the district court for further proceedings the ninth circuit denied our petition for rehearing en banc in november 2017 and the case has been reassigned to the united states district court for the central district of california for further proceedings according to the schedule entered by the court in february 2018 we filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the supreme court of the united states seeking review of the ninth circuit’s decision the overlapping claims in the other lawsuits remain stayed pending final resolution of the appellate process or a final decision in the lead classaction case we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss if any that may arise from these lawsuits however as of december 31 2017 we have recorded a 10 million reserve representing an amount we deem acceptable for the settlement of these claims 

 

in january 2017 we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1 2016 as well as to clarify other issues under our joint service agreement with bnsf bnsf has requested the same and the arbitration process has commenced bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment at this time we are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the arbitration and as such no gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded normal commercial business activity between the parties including load tendering load tracing billing and payments has continued and is expected to continue on a timely basis 

 

we are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition resu lts of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management ’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

 

workers ’ compensation and accident costs 

 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type we have policies in place for 2018 with substantially the same terms as our 2017 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage 

 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2017 we had an accrual of approximately 238 million for estimated claims in addition we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of selfinsurance levels on covered claims at december 31 2017 we have recorded 256 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims insurance premiums and other insurance deposits 

 

revenue equipment 

 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2017 

 

 

 

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

revenue recognition 

 

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks  and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

 

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income t axes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

 

the tax cuts and jobs act the act was enacted in december 2017 beginning in 2018 the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 at december 31 2017 we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act however we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future which is generally 21 the provisional amount recorded resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was 3092 million which is included as a component of income tax from continuing operations we are still refining our calculations for our 2017 federal income tax return which will be filed based on the law prior to the act and could potentially affect the measurement of these balances remaining aspects of the act are not relevant to our operations 

 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

 

 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year 

  

20 17 compared with 2016 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 97 to 719 billion in 2017 compared to 656 billion in 2016 primarily due to overall increased load volume and higher revenue per load in our jbi dcs and ics segments fuel surcharge revenues increased 375 to 754 million in 2017 compared to 548 million in 2016 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2017 revenue increased 71 over 2016 

 

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2017 consolidated operating expenses increased 125 from 2016 while yearoveryear revenue increased 97 resulting in a 2017 operating ratio of 913 compared to 890 in 2016 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 121 in 2017 primarily due to increased rail and truck purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume which increased services provided by thirdparty rail and truck carriers within jbi and ics segments salaries wages and employee benefit costs increase 95 in 2017 from 2016 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers in addition 2016 included a 152 million benefit recorded to reflect a change in our employee paid time off policy 

 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 61 in 2017 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand and equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts 

 

fuel and fuel taxe s expense increased 226 in 2017 compared with 2016 due primarily to increases in the price of fuel during 2017 we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

 

 

 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense

 

operating supplies and expenses increased 103 driven primarily by increased mileage activity and tire expense general and administrative expenses increased 446 from 2016 primarily due to a 202 million expense for the reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that will not meet delivery but also due to increased building rental expense higher professional fee expenses higher computer software subscription costs and increased net losses from asset sales and disposals in 2017 net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 74 million in 2017 compared to net losses of 55 million in 2016 insurance and claims expense increased 576 in 2017 primarily due to higher incident volume and accident severity and an 186 million increase in reserves for certain claims not covered by insurance 

 

net interest expense for 20 17 increased by 132 compared with 2016 due to an increase in average debt levels and higher effective interest rates on our debt during 2017 

 

our effective income tax rate was 1529 in 2017 and 3790 in 2016 the decrease in 2017 was primarily due to a 3092 million decrease in income tax expense resulting from adjustments to our deferred tax balances at december 31 2017 for the change in future tax rates prescribed by the tax cuts and jobs act 

 

segments 

 

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2017 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

  

  

   

 

  

operating data by segment 

  

  

   

 

  

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue increased 76 to 408 billion in 2017 from 380 billion in 2016 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of an 44 increase in load volume and a 31 increase in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue load volume in our transcontinental loads grew 72 while our eastern network was relatively flat compared to 2016 average length of haul increased 14 in 2017 when compared to 2016 revenue per load excluding fuel surcharge was flat in 2017 when compared to 2016 

 

operating income of the jbi segment decreased to 407 million in 2017 from 450 million in 2016 benefits from volume growth and increased revenue per load were offset by increases in rail purchased transportation costs rail inefficiencies higher driver wages and recruiting costs higher equipment ownership costs increased insurance and claims costs which included an 85 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims and the 202 million expense for the reserve of a cash advance for the purchases of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that will not meet delivery in addition 2016 included a 57 million onetime benefit from the change in paid time off policy 

 

dcs segment

operating income of our dcs segment decreased to 171 million in 2017 from 205 million in 2016 the increase in revenue and improved asset utilization were offset by higher driver wages and recruiting costs increased insurance and claims cost which included a 76 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims increased start up expenditures for new customer contracts higher equipment ownership costs and the addition of acquisition costs and intangible asset amortization associated with the purchase of special logistics dedicated llc sld when compared to 2016 in addition 2016 included a 73 million onetime benefit from the change in paid time off policy

operating income decreased to 23 million in 2017 from 36 million in 2016 primarily due to lower gross profit margins increased insurance and claims cost which included a 18 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims increased number of branches less than two years old and higher technology development costs ics gross profit margin decreased to 133 for 2017 from 143 for 2016 ics’s carrier base increased 114 and the employee count increased 158 when compared to 2016 in addition 2016 included a 10 million onetime benefit from the change in paid time off policy 

  

jbt segment 

 

jbt segment revenue decreased 24 to 378 million in 2017 from 388 million in 2016 primarily from a 38 decrease in load count partially offset by a 14 increase in revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2017 decreased 45 compared to 2016 primarily due to the reduction in load volume and a 44 decrease in length of haul 

 

jbt segment had operating income of 23 million in 2017 compared with 30 million in 2016 the decrease in operating income was driven primarily by lower revenue increased driver wages and recruiting costs higher independent contractor cost per mile increased insurance and claims cost which included an 07 million increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims and increased tractor maintenance costs compared to 2016 in addition 2016 included a 12 million onetime benefit from the change in paid time off policy 

 

 

 

201 6 compared with 2015 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 59 to 656 billion in 2016 compared to 619 billion in 2015 primarily due to overall increased load volume partially offset by lower revenue per load in our jbi ics and jbt segments fuel surcharge revenues decreased 184 to 548 million in 2016 compared to 671 million in 2015 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2016 revenue increased 89 over 2015

depreciation and amortization expense increased 64 in 2016 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and new replacement equipment in jbt 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 95 in 2016 compared with 2015 due to decreases in the price of fuel during 2016 partially offset by increased road miles we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense

 

operating supplies and expenses increased 57 driven primarily by increased toll activity and tire expense general and administrative expenses increased 200 from 2015 primarily due to increased charitable contributions and the absence of net gains from asset sales and disposals in 2016 net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 5 million in 2016 compared to net gains of 1 million in 2015 insurance and claims expense increased 64 in 2016 primarily due to higher incident volume 

 

net interest expense for 2016 decreased by 11 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower effective interest rates 

 

 

 

our effective income tax rate was 3790 in 2016 and 3810 in 2015 the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a reduction in permanent differences related to executive compensation and lower state tax rates 

 

jbi segment 

 

jbi segment revenue increased 36 to 380 billion in 2016 from 366 billion in 2015 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of an 81 increase in load volume offset by a 42 decrease in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue load volume in our eastern network increased 67 and transcontinental loads grew 90 compared to 2015 excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 71 and revenue per load decreased 10 in 2016 over the prior year average length of haul remained relatively flat in 2016 when compared to 2015 

 

operating income of the jbi segment decreased to 450 million in 2016 from 477 million in 2015 benefits from volume growth improved network efficiency improved rail service and approximately 57 million from the change in paid time off policy were offset by increased rail purchased transportation costs higher equipment ownership costs increased insurance and cargo claim expense and higher driver wage and retention costs 

 

dcs segment 

 

dcs segment revenue increased 56 to 153 billion in 2016 from 145 billion in 2015 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week increased 12 when compared to 2015 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 73 in 2016 compared to 2015 and productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 28 from 2015 primarily from improved overall operational efficiencies including better integration of assets between customer accounts fewer unseated trucks increased customer supplychain fluidity load counts and customer rate increases dcs ended 2016 with a net additional 193 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2015 

 

operating income of our dcs segment increased to 205 million in 2016 from 163 million in 2015 the increase is primarily due to increased revenue improved asset utilization and approximately 73 million from the change in paid time off policy partially offset by higher driver wage and recruiting costs increased salaries and benefits expenses and higher equipment ownership costs 

 

ics segment 

 

ics segment revenue increased 217 to 852 million in 2016 from 699 million in 2015 overall volumes increased 570 revenue per load decreased 225 primarily due to freight mix changes driven by customer demand contractual business was approximately 74 of the total load volume and 64 of the total revenue in the 2016 compared to 71 of the total load volume and 63 of the total revenue in 2015 

 

operating income remained flat at 36 million for both 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increased revenue and approximately 10 million from the change in paid time off policy being offset by a 63 decrease in gross profit margin increased claim costs higher technology costs and increased personnel costs as the total branch count increased to 42 from 34 at the end of 2015 ics gross profit margin decreased to 143 for 2016 from 153 for 2015 ics’s carrier base increased 114 and the employee count increased 230 when compared to 2015

jbt segment had operating income of 30 million in 2016 compared with 40 million in 2015 benefits from an increased average truck count higher load volume and approximately 12 million from the change in paid time off policy were more than offset by increased driver recruiting costs higher independent contractor cost per mile higher safety and insurance costs and increased tractor maintenance costs 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

net cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat at 855 million in 2017 compared to 854 million in 2016 primarily due to the reduction in pretax earnings and an increase in cash paid for income taxes net of refunds partially offset by the timing of general working capital activities 

 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 651 million in 2017 compared with 485 million in 2016 the increase resulted primarily from the purchase of sld and an increase in equipment purchases net of proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2017 

 

net cash used in financing activities was 196 million in 2017 compared with 368 million in 2016 this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in treasury stock purchased and higher proceeds from longterm debt issuances net of longterm debt repayments in 2017 these net proceeds from longterm debt were used primarily for the purchase of sld 

 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors  and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 021 per share quarterly dividend in 2015 a 022 per share quarterly dividend in 2016 and a 023 per share quarterly dividend in 2017 on january 24 2018 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 023 to 024 per share which will be paid february 23 2018 to stockholders of record on february 9 2018 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

  

liquidity 

 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtain capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment during the third quarter of 2017 we completed our acquisition of sld and its affiliated entities see note 11 acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion we used our existing revolving credit facility to finance this transaction and to provide any necessary liquidity for current and future operations this acquisition did not have a material impact on our interest expense 

 

at december 31 201 7 we were authorized to borrow up to 500 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in september 2020 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2017 we had 242 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 252 under this agreement 

 

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first and second issuances are 250 million of 240 senior notes due march 2019 and 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 respectively both of which were issued in march 2014 interest payments under both notes are due semiannually in march and september of each year the third issuance is 350 million of 330 senior notes due august 2022 issued in august 2015 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year we may redeem for cash some or all of these notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates resulting in interest rates of 243 and 277 respectively at december 31 2017 the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin 

 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2017 

 

 

 

as previously mentioned above t he tax cuts and jobs act was enacted in december 2017 beginning in 2018 the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 which will have a positive effect on our overall liquidity 

 

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations  and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

 

we are currently commi tted to spend approximately 7976 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2018 and 2019 which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers chassis and tractors 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

in addition to o ur net purchase commitments of 7976 million our only other offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 742 million of obligations primarily related to facility leases 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in m illions as of december 31 2017 

 

   

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2017 

 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately  44 million at december 31 2017 that expire at various dates in 2018 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 489 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 240 to 385 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 84 million 

 

 

 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations  or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2017 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather  and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2017 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

operating segments 

  

segment information is also included in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

jbi segment 

  

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint service environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services drayage are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while thirdparty dray carriers are used where economical by performing our own drayage services we are able to provide a costcompetitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers 

  

 

 

  

jbi operates 84594 pieces of companyowned trailing equipment systemwide the fleet primarily consists of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality we own and maintain our own chassis fleet consisting of 73746 units the containers and chassis are uniquely designed so that they may only be paired together which we feel creates an operational competitive advantage jbi also manages a fleet of 4581 companyowned tractors 695 independent contractor trucks and 5398 company drivers at december 31 2016 the total jbi employee count was 6088 revenue for the jbi segment in 2016 was 380 billion 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs focuses on private fleet conversion and creation in replenishment specialized equipment and finalmile delivery services we specialize in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions that support a variety of transportation networks our finalmile delivery services are supported with a network of approximately 89 crossdock locations nationwide with 98 of the continental us population living within 150 miles of a crossdock location contracts with our customers are longterm ranging from three to 10 years with the average being approximately five years pricing of our contracts typically involves costplus arrangements with our fixed costs being recovered regardless of equipment utilization but is customized based on invested capital and duration 

  

at december 31 2016 this segment operated 6976 companyowned trucks 410 customerowned trucks and 15 independent contractor trucks dcs also operates 16139 owned pieces of trailing equipment and 6549 customerowned trailers the dcs segment employed 10291 people including 8554 drivers at december 31 2016 dcs revenue for 2016 was 153 billion 

  

ics segment 

  

ics provides traditional freight brokerage and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers desiring to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates 42 remote sales offices or branches as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers 

  

at december 31 2016 the ics segment employed 824 people with a carrier base of approximately 50900 ics revenue for 2016 was 852 million 

  

jbt segment 

  

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers 

  

at december 31 2016 the jbt segment operated 1376 companyowned tractors and employed 1668 people 1433 of whom were drivers at december 31 2016 we had 752 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment jbt revenue for 2016 was 388 million 

  

marketing and operations 

  

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts agricultural products electronics and chemicals our customers’ business activities are extremely diverse and our customer base includes a large number of fortune 500 companies we provide a broad range of transportation services to shippers seeking to use a variety of transportation options to optimize their supplychain logistics needs 

  

 

 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

 

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2016 we had 22190 employees which consisted of 15385 company drivers 5706 office personnel and 1099 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1462 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

revenue equipment 

  

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our jbt segment operates primarily 53foot dryvan trailers 

  

as of december 31 2016 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 12933 units in addition we had 1462 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2016 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 19 years while our containers averaged 59 years of age and our trailers averaged 76 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities 

  

competition and the industry 

  

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

  

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

  

 

 

  

in 2013 the remaining provisions of the fmcsa’s amendment to the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers became effective and we experienced some negative impact on our productivity as a result however in december 2014 as a result of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 the fmcsa was required to rescind the 34hour restart provision of the amended hos rules to the prejuly 1 2013 requirements furthermore the fmcsa was required to conduct a field study measuring the safety benefit of the amended hos rules before and after this rule change this rule rescission is considered temporary pending the outcome of the study which remains uncompleted we continue to evaluate and adjust the various segments of our operations toward the ultimate impact of these changes in hos safety requirements 

 

in december 2015 the fmcsa published a final rule requiring use of an electronic logging device eld by december 2017 for nearly all carriers we have successfully implemented eld’s within our fleets 

  in 2013 the fmcsa in conjunction with the national highway traffic safety administration submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking which was finalized and published in 2016 requiring the installation of speedlimiting devices on heavy trucks this final rule will have minimal implementation cost for us as all of our heavy trucks subject to this rule already have these devices installed we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

  

in 2016 the fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking to adopt revised methodologies towards a safety fitness determination sfd for motor carriers the proposed methodologies would determine when a motor carrier is not fit to operate commercial motor vehicles based on the carriers onroad safety performance in relation to five of the agencys seven behavioral analysis and safety improvement categories basic a formal investigation or a combination of the two the intent of this action is to more effectively use fmcsa data and resources to identify unfit motor carriers and remove them from interstate commerce we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

  

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control in addition to general us economic trends and to a lesser extent global economic trends these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads rail service delays disruptions to us portofcall activity significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries or license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions disruption or failure of information technology systems increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment volatile financial credit markets and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

 

 

    

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the bnsf railway company bnsf and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

in january 2017 we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1 2016 as well as to clarify other issues under our joint service agreement with bnsf bnsf has requested the same and the arbitration process has commenced bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment at this time we are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the arbitration and as such no gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded normal commercial business activity between the parties including load tendering load tracing billing and payments is expected to continue on a timely basis 

  

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2016 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2017 with substantially the same terms as our 2016 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

      

 

 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2016 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 29 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a longterm written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot fmcsa and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

    

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

  

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation 

  

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins 

  

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

    

 

 

  

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

in january 2017 we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning may 1 2016 as well as to clarify other issues under our joint service agreement with bnsf bnsf has requested the same and the arbitration process has commenced bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment at this time we are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of the arbitration and as such no gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded normal commercial business activity between the parties including load tendering load tracing billing and payments is expected to continue on a timely basis 

  

we are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

  

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

  

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type we have policies in place for 2017 with substantially the same terms as our 2016 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and if applicable conversion to fully insured status and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2016 we had an accrual of approximately 98 million for estimated claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2016 we had an aggregate prepaid insurance asset of approximately 93 million which represented prefunded premiums and deposits 

  

revenue equipment 

  

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2016 

    

 

 

  

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

  

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

  

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

    

 

 

    

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year 

  

   

2016 compared with 2015 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues increased 59 to 656 billion in 2016 compared to 619 billion in 2015 primarily due to overall increased load volume partially offset by lower revenue per load in our jbi ics and jbt segments fuel surcharge revenues decreased 184 to 548 million in 2016 compared to 671 million in 2015 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2016 revenue increased 89 over 2015 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2016 consolidated operating expenses increased 66 from 2015 while yearoveryear revenue increased 59 resulting in a 2016 operating ratio of 890 compared to 884 in 2015 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 87 in 2016 primarily the result of increased rail purchased transportation rates and the increase in load volume which increased services provided by thirdparty rail and truck carriers within jbi and ics segments salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 54 in 2016 from 2015 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers partially offset by a 152 million onetime benefit recorded to reflect a change in our employee paid time off policy 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased 64 in 2016 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and new replacement equipment in jbt 

  

 

 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 95 in 2016 compared with 2015 due to decreases in the price of fuel during 2016 partially offset by increased road miles we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

    

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

  

operating supplies and expenses increased 57 driven primarily by increased toll activity and tire expense general and administrative expenses increased 200 from 2015 primarily due to increased charitable contributions and the absence of net gains from asset sales and disposals in 2016 net losses from sale or disposal of assets were 5 million in 2016 compared to net gains of 1 million in 2015 insurance and claims expense increased 64 in 2016 primarily due to higher incident volume 

  

net interest expense for 2016 decreased by 11 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower effective interest rates 

  

our effective income tax rate was 3790 in 2016 and 3810 in 2015 the decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a reduction in permanent differences related to executive compensation and lower state tax rates 

  

segments 

  

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2016 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

    

  

     

 

 

    

operating data by segment 

  

   

       

 

 

    

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue increased 36 to 380 billion in 2016 from 366 billion in 2015 this increase in revenue was primarily a result of an 81 increase in load volume offset by a 42 decrease in revenue per load which is the combination of changes in freight mix customer rates and fuel surcharge revenue load volume in our eastern network increased 67 and transcontinental loads grew 90 compared to 2015 excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 71 and revenue per load decreased 10 in 2016 over the prior year average length of haul remained relatively flat in 2016 when compared to 2015 

  

operating income of the jbi segment decreased to 450 million in 2016 from 477 million in 2015 benefits from volume growth improved network efficiency improved rail service and approximately 57 million from the change in paid time off policy were offset by increased rail purchased transportation costs higher equipment ownership costs increased insurance and cargo claim expense and higher driver wage and retention costs 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 56 to 153 billion in 2016 from 145 billion in 2015 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week increased 12 when compared to 2015 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 73 in 2016 compared to 2015 and productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 28 from 2015 primarily from improved overall operational efficiencies including better integration of assets between customer accounts fewer unseated trucks increased customer supplychain fluidity load counts and customer rate increases dcs ended 2016 with a net additional 193 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2015 

  

operating income of our dcs segment increased to 205 million in 2016 from 163 million in 2015 the increase is primarily due to increased revenue improved asset utilization and approximately 73 million from the change in paid time off policy partially offset by higher driver wage and recruiting costs increased salaries and benefits expenses and higher equipment ownership costs 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue increased 217 to 852 million in 2016 from 699 million in 2015 overall volumes increased 570 revenue per load decreased 225 primarily due to freight mix changes driven by customer demand contractual business was approximately 74 of the total load volume and 64 of the total revenue in the 2016 compared to 71 of the total load volume and 63 of the total revenue in 2015 

  

operating income remained flat at 36 million for both 2016 and 2015 primarily due to increased revenue and approximately 10 million from the change in paid time off policy being offset by a 63 decrease in gross profit margin increased claim costs higher technology costs and increased personnel costs as the total branch count increased to 42 from 34 at the end of 2015 ics gross profit margin decreased to 143 for 2016 from 153 for 2015 ics’s carrier base increased 114 and the employee count increased 230 when compared to 2015

jbt segment revenue increased 06 to 388 million in 2016 from 386 million in 2015 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2016 increased 38 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased average truck count partially offset by core customer rate decreases and freight mix changes 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 30 million in 2016 compared with 40 million in 2015 benefits from an increased average truck count higher load volume and approximately 12 million from the change in paid time off policy were more than offset by increased driver recruiting costs higher independent contractor cost per mile higher safety and insurance costs and increased tractor maintenance costs 

    

 

 

    

2015 compared with 2014 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues were 619 billion in 2015 remaining relatively flat when compared to 617 billion in 2014 overall customer rate increases and load growth and increased fleet counts in our jbi dcs and jbt segments were offset by a 380 decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to 671 million in 2015 when compared to 108 billion in 2014 due to decreases in the price of fuel during the year if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2015 revenue increased 85 over 2014 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2015 consolidated operating expenses decreased 11 from 2014 while yearoveryear revenue remained flat resulting in a 2015 operating ratio of 884 compared to 898 in 2014 rents and purchased transportation costs decreased 29 in 2015 primarily the result of the lower fuel component in the cost of services provided by thirdparty rail and truck carriers within jbi dcs and ics segments salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 81 in 2015 from 2014 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased 153 in 2015 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and new replacement equipment in jbt 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 310 in 2015 compared with 2014 due to decreases in the price of fuel during 2015 partially offset by increased road miles we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

  

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

  

operating supplies and expenses increased 09 driven primarily by increased toll rates and activity partially offset by decreased general equipment maintenance and repair costs general and administrative expenses increased 433 from 2014 due primarily to costs related to corporate wide streamlining and technology redevelopment efforts net gains from sale or disposal of assets were 1 million in 2015 compared with 6 million in 2014 insurance and claims expense decreased 91 in 2015 primarily due to decreased accident severity and fewer incidents 

  

net interest expense for 2015 decreased by 54 compared with 2014 primarily due to lower effective interest rates 

  

our effective income tax rate was 3810 in 2015 and 3801 in 2014 the increase in 2015 was primarily related to an increase in state income tax expense 

    

 

 

    

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue decreased 06 to 366 billion in 2015 from 369 billion in 2014 resulting from a decrease in revenue per load which is attributable to customer rate increases offset by lower fuel surcharges and freight mix this decrease was partially offset by increases in load volume in both our eastern and transcontinental networks excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 87 and revenue per load increased 44 in 2015 over the prior year average length of haul remained relatively flat in 2015 when compared to 2014 

  

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 477 million in 2015 from 461 million in 2014 this increase was primarily due to customer rate increases increased load volume reduced reliance on outsourced dray carriers lower insurance and cargo claim costs and lower maintenance costs partially offset by increases in rail purchased transportation rates higher equipment depreciation expense higher driver procurement and retention expenses and 64 million in corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 41 to 145 billion in 2015 from 139 billion in 2014 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week decreased 17 when compared to 2014 primarily from lower fuel surcharge revenue revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 100 in 2015 compared to 2014 and productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 39 from 2014 primarily from customer rate increases and additional activity at customer accounts dcs ended 2015 with a net additional 328 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2014 

  

operating income increased to 163 million in 2015 compared with 117 million in 2014 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue improved asset utilization less reliance on thirdparty carriers and lower maintenance costs partially offset by increased equipment depreciation expense higher driver wage and recruiting costs and 26 million in corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue decreased 26 to 699 million in 2015 from 718 million in 2014 this decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased revenue per load resulting from lower fuel prices changes in freight mix and less transactional customer demand partially offset by an increase in overall load volume contractual business was approximately 71 of the total load volume and 63 of the total revenue in the 2015 compared to 63 of the total load volume and 55 of the total revenue in 2014 

  

operating income increased to 36 million in 2015 compared to 30 million in 2014 primarily due to improved gross profit margin ics gross profit margin increased to 153 for 2015 from 130 for 2014 improvements in gross profit margin were offset by approximately 44 million in corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs and higher personnel costs as the total branch count increased to 34 from 29 at the end of 2014 ics’s carrier base increased 17 and the employee count increased 15 when compared to 2014 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue remained flat at 386 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2015 increased 75 compared to 2014 primarily due to increased truck count and core rate increases 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 40 million in 2015 compared with 24 million in 2014 benefits from an increased truck count core rate increases and improvements in equipment maintenance costs insurance and claims costs and fuel economy were partially offset by lower asset utilization higher driver wage and hiring costs lower gains on equipment sales increased equipment depreciation expense increased driver and independent contractor costs per mile and corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs 

    

 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 854 million in 2016 and 873 million in 2015 this decrease in 2016 was primarily due to the timing of collections of trade and other receivables partially offset by increased earnings collection of income taxes receivable and the timing of the payments of trade payables 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 485 million in 2016 compared with 577 million in 2015 the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in equipment purchases partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2016 compared to 2015 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 368 million in 2016 compared with 297 million in 2015 this change resulted primarily from higher longterm debt repayments net of proceeds from longterm debt in 2016 partially offset by a reduction in treasury stock purchases 

  

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 020 per share quarterly dividend in 2014 a 021 per share quarterly dividend in 2015 and a 022 per share quarterly dividend in 2016 on january 25 2017 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 022 to 023 per share which will be paid february 24 2017 to stockholders of record on february 10 2017 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtain capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment 

  

at december 31 2016 we were authorized to borrow up to 500 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in september 2020 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2016 we had 140 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 176 under this agreement 

  

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first and second issuances are 250 million of 240 senior notes due march 2019 and 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 respectively both of which were issued in march 2014 interest payments under both notes are due semiannually in march and september of each year the third issuance is 350 million of 330 senior notes due august 2022 issued in august 2015 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year we may redeem for cash some or all of these notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates resulting in interest rates of 181 and 226 respectively at december 31 2016 the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin 

  

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2016 

  

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

    

 

 

  

we are currently committed to spend approximately 967 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2017 and 2018 which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers chassis and tractors 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 367 million of obligations primarily related to facility leases 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2016 

  

   

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2016 

  

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 44 million at december 31 2016 that expire at various dates in 2017 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 398 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 240 to 385 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 74 million 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2016 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

    

 

 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2016 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

operating segments 

  

segment information is also included in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

jbi segment 

  

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint service environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services “drayage” are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while thirdparty dray carriers are used where economical by performing our own drayage services we are able to provide a costcompetitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers 

  

jbi operates 78957 pieces of companyowned trailing equipment systemwide the fleet primarily consists of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality we own and maintain our own chassis fleet consisting of 68076 units the containers and chassis are uniquely designed so that they may only be paired together which we feel creates an operational competitive advantage jbi also manages a fleet of 4276 companyowned tractors 805 independent contractor trucks and 5172 company drivers at december 31 2015 the total jbi employee count was 5838 revenue for the jbi segment in 2015 was 366 billion 

  

 

 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs focuses on private fleet conversion and creation in replenishment specialized equipment and finalmile delivery services we specialize in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions that support a variety of transportation networks our finalmile delivery services are supported with a network of approximately 89 crossdock locations nationwide with 98 of the continental us population living within 150 miles of a crossdock location contracts with our customers are longterm ranging from three to ten years with the average being approximately five years pricing of our contracts typically involves costplus arrangements with our fixed costs being recovered regardless of equipment utilization but is customized based on invested capital and duration 

  

at december 31 2015 this segment operated 6762 companyowned trucks 436 customerowned trucks and 10 independent contractor trucks dcs also operates 15020 owned pieces of trailing equipment and 6652 customerowned trailers the dcs segment employed 9948 people including 8256 drivers at december 31 2015 dcs revenue for 2015 was 145 billion 

  

ics segment 

  

ics provides traditional freight brokerage and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers desiring to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates 34 remote sales offices or branches as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers 

  

at december 31 2015 the ics segment employed 670 people with a carrier base of approximately 45700 ics revenue for 2015 was 699 million 

  

jbt segment 

  

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers 

  

at december 31 2015 the jbt segment operated 1462 companyowned tractors and employed 1847 people 1615 of whom were drivers at december 31 2015 we had 687 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment jbt revenue for 2015 was 386 million 

  

marketing and operations 

  

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts agricultural products electronics and chemicals our customers’ business activities are extremely diverse and our customer base includes a large number of fortune 500 companies we provide a broad range of transportation services to shippers seeking to use a variety of transportation options to optimize their supplychain logistics needs 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

  

 

 

  

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2015 we had 21562 employees which consisted of 15043 company drivers 5397 office personnel and 1122 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1502 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

revenue equipment 

  

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers 

  

as of december 31 2015 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 12500 units in addition we had 1502 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2015 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 19 years while our containers averaged 56 years of age and our trailers averaged 86 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities 

  

competition and the industry 

  

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

  

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

  

in 2013 the remaining provisions of the fmcsa’s amendment to the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers became effective and we experienced some negative impact on our productivity as a result however in december 2014 as a result of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 the fmcsa was required to rescind the 34hour restart provision of the amended hos rules to the prejuly 1 2013 requirements furthermore the fmcsa was required to conduct a field study measuring the safety benefit of the amended hos rules before and after this rule change this rule rescission is considered temporary pending the outcome of the study we continue to evaluate and adjust the various segments of our operations toward the ultimate impact of these changes in hos safety requirements 

  

 

 

  

in december 2015 the fmcsa published a final rule requiring logging drivers to complete their logs using an electronic logging device eld since the issuance of the initial proposal of this rule change we have successfully implemented a plan to replace any legacy onboard recording equipment within our fleets at december 31 2015 we had replaced approximately 96 of this equipment and anticipate replacing the remaining equipment within the mandated timetable we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations 

  

in 2013 the fmcsa in conjunction with the national highway traffic safety administration submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking to require the installation of speedlimiting devices on heavy trucks the final rule regarding this proposal is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2016 we believe this rule will have minimal implementation cost as all of our heavy trucks subject to this rule already have these devices installed we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

  

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control in addition to general us economic trends and to a lesser extent global economic trends these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads rail service delays disruptions to us portofcall activity significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries or license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions disruption or failure of information technology systems increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment volatile financial credit markets and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with or the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

 

 

  

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2015 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2016 with substantially the same terms as our 2015 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2015 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 29 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a longterm written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

  

 

 

  

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

  

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation 

  

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins 

  

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

  

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a defendant in certain classaction lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are current and former californiabased drivers who allege claims for unpaid wages failure to provide meal and rest periods and other items during the first half of 2014 the court in the lead classaction granted judgment in our favor with regard to all claims the plaintiffs have appealed the case to the ninth circuit court of appeals where it is currently pending the overlapping claims in the remaining action have been stayed pending a decision in the lead classaction case we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss if any that may arise from these lawsuits 

  

we are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

  

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

  

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type we have policies in place for 2016 with substantially the same terms as our 2015 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and if applicable conversion to fully insured status and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2015 we had an accrual of approximately 95 million for estimated claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2015 we had an aggregate prepaid insurance asset of approximately 87 million which represented prefunded premiums and deposits 

  

revenue equipment 

  

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2015 

  

 

 

  

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

  

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

  

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

  

 

 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year 

 

   

2015 compared with 2014 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues were 619 billion in 2015 remaining relatively flat when compared to 617 billion in 2014 overall customer rate increases and load growth and increased fleet counts in our jbi dcs and jbt segments were offset by a 380 decrease in fuel surcharge revenue to 671 million in 2015 when compared to 108 billion in 2014 due to decreases in the price of fuel during the year if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2015 revenue increased 85 over 2014 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2015 consolidated operating expenses decreased 11 from 2014 while yearoveryear revenue remained flat resulting in a 2015 operating ratio of 884 compared to 898 in 2014 rents and purchased transportation costs decreased 29 in 2015 primarily the result of the lower fuel component in the cost of services provided by thirdparty rail and truck carriers within jbi dcs and ics segments salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 81 in 2015 from 2014 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 310 in 2015 compared with 2014 due to decreases in the price of fuel during 2015 partially offset by increased road miles we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

  

 

 

  

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased 153 in 2015 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and new replacement equipment in jbt operating supplies and expenses increased 09 driven primarily by increased toll rates and activity partially offset by decreased general equipment maintenance and repair costs insurance and claims expense decreased 91 in 2015 primarily due to decreased accident severity and fewer incidents general and administrative expenses increased 433 from 2014 due primarily to costs related to corporate wide streamlining and technology redevelopment efforts net gains from sale or disposal of assets were 1 million in 2015 compared with 6 million in 2014 

  

net interest expense for 2015 decreased by 54 compared with 2014 primarily due to lower effective interest rates 

  

our effective income tax rate was 3810 in 2015 and 3801 in 2014 the increase in 2015 was primarily related to an increase in state income tax expense we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the range of 3800 to 3810 for calendar year 2016 

  

segments 

  

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2015 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

  

  

  

   

 

 

  

operating data by segment 

  

   

     

 

 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue decreased 06 to 366 billion in 2015 from 369 billion in 2014 resulting from a decrease in revenue per load which is attributable to customer rate increases offset by lower fuel surcharges and freight mix this decrease was partially offset by increases in load volume in both our eastern and transcontinental networks excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 87 and revenue per load increased 44 in 2015 over the prior year average length of haul remained relatively flat in 2015 when compared to 2014 

  

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 477 million in 2015 from 461 million in 2014 this increase was primarily due to customer rate increases increased load volume reduced reliance on outsourced dray carriers lower insurance and cargo claim costs and lower maintenance costs partially offset by increases in rail purchased transportation rates higher equipment depreciation expense higher driver procurement and retention expenses and 64 million in corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 41 to 145 billion in 2015 from 139 billion in 2014 productivity defined as revenue per truck per week decreased 17 when compared to 2014 primarily from lower fuel surcharge revenue revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 100 in 2015 compared to 2014 and productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 39 from 2014 primarily from customer rate increases and additional activity at customer accounts dcs ended 2015 with a net additional 328 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2014 

  

operating income increased to 163 million in 2015 compared with 117 million in 2014 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue improved asset utilization less reliance on thirdparty carriers and lower maintenance costs partially offset by increased equipment depreciation expense higher driver wage and recruiting costs and 26 million in corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue decreased 26 to 699 million in 2015 from 718 million in 2014 this decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased revenue per load resulting from lower fuel prices changes in freight mix and less transactional customer demand partially offset by an increase in overall load volume contractual business was approximately 71 of the total load volume and 63 of the total revenue in the 2015 compared to 63 of the total load volume and 55 of the total revenue in 2014 

  

operating income increased to 36 million in 2015 compared to 30 million in 2014 primarily due to improved gross profit margin ics gross profit margin increased to 153 for 2015 from 130 for 2014 improvements in gross profit margin were offset by approximately 44 million in corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs and higher personnel costs as the total branch count increased to 34 from 29 at the end of 2014 ics’s carrier base increased 17 and the employee count increased 15 when compared to 2014 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue remained flat at 386 million in 2015 when compared to 2014 excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2015 increased 75 compared to 2014 primarily due to increased truck count and core rate increases 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 40 million in 2015 compared with 24 million in 2014 benefits from an increased truck count core rate increases and improvements in equipment maintenance costs insurance and claims costs and fuel economy were partially offset by lower asset utilization higher driver wage and hiring costs lower gains on equipment sales increased equipment depreciation expense increased driver and independent contractor costs per mile and corporatewide streamlining and technology redevelopment costs 

  

 

 

  

2014 compared with 2013 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues were 62 billion in 2014 a 104 increase over 2013 primarily due to increased load volume and rate increases fuel surcharge revenues remained flat at 11 billion in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to decreases in the price of fuel during the second half of 2014 if fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years our 2014 revenue increased 123 over 2013 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2014 consolidated operating expenses increased 105 from 2013 compared to the 104 increase in revenue year over year resulting in a 2014 operating ratio of 898 compared to 897 in 2013 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 100 in 2014 primarily due to the increase in load volume that increased services from thirdparty rail and truck carriers within our jbi dcs and ics segments salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 134 in 2014 from 2013 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers in addition workers’ compensation claims expense increased due to increases in both incident volume and severity as well as increased insurance premium costs 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 04 in 2014 compared with 2013 due to decreases in the price of fuel and improved fuel efficiency during 2014 partially offset by increased road miles we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

  

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased 162 in 2014 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and new replacement tractors and trailers in jbt operating supplies and expenses increased 78 driven primarily by increased general maintenance costs resulting from growth in equipment fleets and increased toll activity insurance and claims expense increased 470 for 2014 primarily due to higher incidents and increased accident severity general and administrative expenses increased 113 due primarily to an increase in driver advertising higher building and facility rental expenses and increased professional fees partially offset by an increase in net gains from asset sales and disposals net gains from the disposal of assets were 6 million in 2014 compared with 5 million in 2013 

  

net interest expense for 2014 increased by 164 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased average debt levels 

  

our effective income tax rate was 3801 in 2014 and 3815 in 2013 the decrease in 2014 was primarily related to a decrease in the provision for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years 

  

 

 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment experienced an environment of challenging rail service and limited dray fleet capacity throughout 2014 jbi segment revenue increased 67 to 369 billion in 2014 from 346 billion in 2013 primarily due to a 67 increase in overall load volume with both our eastern and transcontinental networks reporting increased volumes excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 80 in 2014 over the prior year the combination of traffic mix customer rate increases and fuel surcharge revenue resulted in revenue per load remaining unchanged compared to a year ago average length of haul decreased 23 in 2014 when compared to 2013 

  

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 461 million in 2014 from 447 million in 2013 this increase was primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by slow train speeds and reductions in dray fleet capacity throughout 2014 which negatively impacted the network fluidity resulting in a reduction in box turns and dray power utilization in addition jbi experienced higher driver procurement and retention expenses increased rail and dray purchased transportation costs higher insurance and claims costs and increased equipment costs during 2014 when compared to 2013 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 132 to 139 billion in 2014 from 123 billion in 2013 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 141 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily attributable to large existing accounts becoming fully implemented in the current year new customer contracts and rate increases established in the latter half of 2014 dcs ended 2014 with a net additional 473 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2013 productivity for 2014 defined as revenue per truck per week was virtually flat when compared to 2013 due to the large number of customer accounts affected by severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014 and continued driver shortages throughout the current year 

  

operating income increased to 117 million in 2014 compared with 110 million in 2013 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by higher driver recruiting and retention costs increased insurance and workers’ compensation costs higher purchased transportation costs increased equipment and maintenance expenses and fewer gains on the sale of equipment compared to 2013 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue grew 338 to 718 million in 2014 from 537 million in 2013 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 166 increase in load volume and a 148 increase in revenue per load in 2014 when compared to 2013 both transactional and contractual business experienced increased load volumes contractual business was approximately 63 of the total load volume but only 55 of the total revenue in the 2014 compared to 64 of the total load volume and 61 of the total revenue in 2013 

  

operating income increased to 30 million in 2014 compared to 16 million in 2013 ics gross profit margin increased to 130 for 2014 from 118 for 2013 primarily due to customer rate increases in contractual business and maintaining margin discipline in transactional business ics incurred increased personnel and branch network expansion costs during 2014 resulting from the continued expansion of the segment’s branch location network 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue decreased 14 to 386 million in 2014 from 391 million in 2013 primarily due to operating a reduced fleet size for the majority of 2014 partially offset by increased pricing excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2014 increased 09 compared to 2013 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 24 million in 2014 compared with 4 million in 2013 this increase in operating income was primarily due to increased rate per loaded mile lower personnel costs a smaller trailer fleet and gains on equipment sales offset by increased driver hiring costs increases in driver and independent contractor costs per mile higher maintenance and equipment costs per unit and increased insurance and safety costs 

  

 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 873 million in 2015 and 647 million in 2014 this increase in 2015 was primarily due to increased earnings and the collection of trade and income taxes receivable partially offset by the timing of the payments of trade payables and accrued expenses 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 577 million in 2015 compared with 660 million in 2014 the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in equipment purchases combined with an increase in proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2015 compared to 2014 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 297 million in 2015 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 13 million in 2014 this change resulted primarily from an increase in treasury stock purchases and lower longterm debt issuances net of longterm debt repayments in 2015 

  

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 015 per share quarterly dividend in 2013 with the first quarter dividend being pulled forward and paid in fourth quarter 2012 a 020 per share quarterly dividend in 2014 and a 021 per share quarterly dividend in 2015 on january 28 2016 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 021 to 022 per share which will be paid february 26 2016 to stockholders of record on february 12 2016 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtain capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment 

  

at december 31 2015 we were authorized to borrow up to 500 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in september 2020 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2015 we had 150 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 139 under this agreement 

  

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first and second issuances are 250 million of 240 senior notes due march 2019 and 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 respectively both of which were issued in march 2014 interest payments under both notes are due semiannually in march and september of each year the third issuance is 350 million of 330 senior notes due august 2022 issued in august 2015 interest payments under this note are due semiannually in february and august of each year beginning february 2016 we may redeem for cash some or all of these notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates resulting in interest rates of 136 and 172 respectively at december 31 2015 the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin 

  

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2015 

  

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

  

we are currently committed to spend approximately 463 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2016 and 2017 which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers chassis and tractors 

  

 

 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 281 million of obligations primarily related to facility leases 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2015 

  

   

 

  

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 44 million at december 31 2015 that expire at various dates in 2016 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 360 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 240 to 385 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 and our 350 million of 330 fixedrate senior notes due august 2022 to variable rates the applicable interest rates under these swap agreements are based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 75 million 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2015 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

 

 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2015 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

operating segments 

  

segment information is also included in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

jbi segment 

  

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint service environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services “drayage” are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while thirdparty dray carriers are used where economical by performing our own drayage services we are able to provide a costcompetitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers 

  

jbi operates 73298 pieces of companyowned trailing equipment systemwide the fleet primarily consists of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality we own and maintain our own chassis fleet consisting of 65455 units the containers and chassis are uniquely designed so that they may only be paired together which we feel creates an operational competitive advantage jbi also manages a fleet of 3916 companyowned tractors 761 independent contractor trucks and 4756 company drivers at december 31 2014 the total jbi employee count was 5340 revenue for the jbi segment in 2014 was 37 billion 

  

  

 

 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs focuses on private fleet conversion and creation in replenishment specialized equipment and finalmile delivery services we specialize in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions that support a variety of transportation networks our finalmile delivery services are supported with a network of approximately 89 crossdock locations nationwide with 98 of the continental us population living within 150 miles of a crossdock location contracts with our customers are longterm ranging from three to ten years with the average being approximately five years pricing of our contracts typically involves costplus arrangements with our fixed costs being recovered regardless of equipment utilization but is customized based on invested capital and duration 

  

at december 31 2014 this segment operated 6425 companyowned trucks 448 customerowned trucks and 7 independent contractor trucks dcs also operates 13852 owned pieces of trailing equipment and 6664 customerowned trailers the dcs segment employed 9466 people including 7833 drivers at december 31 2014 dcs revenue for 2014 was 14 billion 

  

ics segment 

  

ics provides traditional freight brokerage and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers desiring to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates 29 remote sales offices or branches as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers 

  

at december 31 2014 the ics segment employed 582 people with a carrier base of approximately 39100 ics revenue for 2014 was 718 million 

  

jbt segment 

  

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers 

  

at december 31 2014 the jbt segment operated 1296 companyowned tractors and employed 1604 people 1378 of whom were drivers at december 31 2014 we had 590 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment jbt revenue for 2014 was 386 million 

  

marketing and operations 

  

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts agricultural products electronics and chemicals our customers’ business activities are extremely diverse and our customer base includes a large number of fortune 500 companies we provide a broad range of transportation services to shippers seeking to use a variety of transportation options to optimize their supplychain logistics needs 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

  

  

 

 

  

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2014 we had 20158 employees which consisted of 13967 company drivers 5059 office personnel and 1132 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1358 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

revenue equipment 

  

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers 

  

as of december 31 2014 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 11637 units in addition we had 1358 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2014 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 23 years while our containers averaged 52 years of age and our trailers averaged 95 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities 

  

competition and the industry 

  

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

  

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

  

in 2011 the fmcsa amended the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers the remaining provisions of the amended hos rules became effective july 1 2013 and we experienced some negative impact on our productivity as a result however in december 2014 as a result of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act of 2015 the fmcsa was required to rescind the 34hour restart provision of the amended hos rules to the prejuly 1 2013 requirements furthermore the fmcsa was required to conduct a field study measuring the safety benefit of the amended hos rules before and after this rule change this rule rescission is considered temporary pending the outcome of the study we continue to evaluate and adjust the various segments of our operations toward the ultimate impact of these changes in hos safety requirements 

  

  

 

 

  

in 2011 the fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking to require currently logging drivers to complete their logs using an electronic logging device eld the final rule regarding this proposal is expected to be published in the third quarter of 2015 since the issuance of this proposal we have successfully implemented a plan to replace any legacy onboard recording equipment within our fleets at december 31 2014 we had replaced approximately 90 of this equipment we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

  

in 2013 the fmcsa in conjunction with the national highway traffic safety administration submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking to require the installation of speedlimiting devices on heavy trucks the final rule regarding this proposal is expected to be published in the third quarter of 2015 we believe this rule will have minimal implementation cost as all of our heavy trucks subject to this rule already have these devices installed we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

  

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads disruptions to us portofcall activity significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries or license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions disruption or failure of information technology systems increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways a material change in the relationship with or the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  

 

 

  

we also utilize independent contractors and thirdparty carriers to complete our services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2014 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2015 with substantially the same terms as our 2014 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2014 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 28 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a longterm written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

  

  

 

 

  

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle dispose of the equipment altogether or rely more on highercost thirdparty carriers which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

  

we rely significantly on our information technology systems a disruption failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate track and complete customer orders process financial and nonfinancial data compile results of operations for internal and external reporting and achieve operating efficiencies and growth our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions including equipment or network failures failed upgrades or replacement of software user error power outages natural disasters cyberattacks terrorist attacks computer viruses hackers or other security breaches we have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient a significant disruption failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business which could include operational disruptions loss of confidential information external reporting delays or errors legal claims or damage to our business reputation 

  

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins 

  

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

  

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we are a defendant in certain classaction lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are current and former californiabased drivers who allege claims for unpaid wages failure to provide meal and rest periods and other items during the first half of 2014 the court in the lead classaction granted judgment in our favor with regard to all claims the plaintiffs have appealed the case to the ninth circuit court of appeals and we are currently awaiting the appointment of a panel of judges the overlapping claims in the remaining two actions have been stayed pending a decision in the lead classaction case we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss if any that may arise from these lawsuits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

  

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

  

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type we have policies in place for 2015 with substantially the same terms as our 2014 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and if applicable conversion to fully insured status and provides a reserve for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2014 we had an accrual of approximately 88 million for estimated claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2014 we had an aggregate prepaid insurance asset of approximately 68 million which represented prefunded premiums and deposits 

  

revenue equipment 

  

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2014 

  

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

 

 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

  

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

  

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 7 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

  

 

 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

 

   

2014 compared with 2013 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues were 62 billion in 2014 a 104 increase over 2013 primarily due to increased load volume and rate increases fuel surcharge fsc revenues remained flat at 11 billion in 2014 when compared to 2013 due to decreases in the price of fuel during the second half of 2014 if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2014 revenue increased 123 over 2013 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2014 consolidated operating expenses increased 105 from 2013 compared to the 104 increase in revenue year over year resulting in a 2014 operating ratio of 898 compared to 897 in 2013 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 100 in 2014 primarily due to the increase in load volume that increased services from thirdparty rail and truck carriers within our jbi dcs and ics segments salaries wages and employee benefit costs increased 134 in 2014 from 2013 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to an increase in the number of employees and a tighter supply of qualified drivers in addition workers’ compensation claims expense increased due to increases in both incident volume and severity as well as increased insurance premium costs 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 04 in 2014 compared with 2013 due to decreases in the price of fuel and improved fuel efficiency during 2014 partially offset by increased road miles we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

  

  

 

 

  

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased 162 in 2014 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and new replacement tractors and trailers in jbt operating supplies and expenses increased 78 driven primarily by increased general maintenance costs resulting from growth in equipment fleets and increased toll activity insurance and claims expense increased 470 for 2014 primarily due to higher incident volume and increased accident severity general and administrative expenses increased 113 due primarily to an increase in driver advertising higher building and facility rental expenses and increased professional fees partially offset by an increase in net gains from asset sales and disposals net gains from the disposal of assets were 6 million in 2014 compared with 5 million in 2013 

  

net interest expense for 2014 increased by 164 compared with 2013 primarily due to increased average debt levels 

  

our effective income tax rate was 3801 in 2014 and 3815 in 2013 the decrease in 2014 was primarily related to a decrease in the provision for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years 

  

segments 

  

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2014 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment   

  

  

   

  

 

 

  

operating data by segment 

  

   

   

  

 

 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment experienced an environment of challenging rail service and limited dray fleet capacity throughout 2014 jbi segment revenue increased 67 to 369 billion in 2014 from 346 billion in 2013 primarily due to a 67 increase in overall load volume with both our eastern and transcontinental networks reporting increased volumes excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 80 in 2014 over the prior year the combination of traffic mix customer rate increases and fsc revenue resulted in revenue per load remaining unchanged compared to a year ago average length of haul decreased 23 in 2014 when compared to 2013 

  

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 461 million in 2014 from 447 million in 2013 this increase was primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by slow train speeds and reductions in dray fleet capacity throughout 2014 which negatively impacted the network fluidity resulting in a reduction in box turns and dray power utilization in addition jbi experienced higher driver procurement and retention expenses increased rail and dray purchased transportation costs higher insurance and claims costs and increased equipment costs during 2014 when compared to 2013 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 132 to 139 billion in 2014 from 123 billion in 2013 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 141 in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily attributable to large existing accounts becoming fully implemented in the current year new customer contracts and rate increases established in the latter half of 2014 dcs ended 2014 with a net additional 473 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2013 productivity for 2014 defined as revenue per truck per week was virtually flat when compared to 2013 due to the large number of customer accounts affected by severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of 2014 and continued driver shortages throughout the current year 

  

operating income increased to 117 million in 2014 compared with 110 million in 2013 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by higher driver recruiting and retention costs increased insurance and workers’ compensation costs higher purchased transportation costs increased equipment and maintenance expenses and fewer gains on the sale of equipment compared to 2013 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue grew 338 to 718 million in 2014 from 537 million in 2013 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 166 increase in load volume and a 148 increase in revenue per load in 2014 when compared to 2013 both transactional and contractual business experienced increased load volumes contractual business was approximately 63 of the total load volume but only 55 of the total revenue in the 2014 compared to 64 of the total load volume and 61 of the total revenue in 2013 

  

operating income increased to 30 million in 2014 compared to 16 million in 2013 ics gross profit margin increased to 130 for 2014 from 118 for 2013 primarily due to customer rate increases in contractual business and maintaining margin discipline in transactional business ics incurred increased personnel and branch network expansion costs during 2014 resulting from the continued expansion of the segment’s branch location network 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue decreased 14 to 386 million in 2014 from 391 million in 2013 primarily due to operating a reduced fleet size for the majority of 2014 partially offset by increased pricing excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2014 increased 09 compared to 2013 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 24 million in 2014 compared with 4 million in 2013 this increase in operating income was primarily due to increased rate per loaded mile lower personnel costs a smaller trailer fleet and gains on equipment sales offset by increased driver hiring costs increases in driver and independent contractor costs per mile higher maintenance and equipment costs per unit and increased insurance and safety costs 

  

  

 

 

  

2013 compared with 2012 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues were 56 billion in 2013 a 105 increase over 2012 primarily due to increased load volume fuel surcharge fsc revenues increased to 11 billion in 2013 compared with 997 million in 2012 due to overall increased load volumes if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2013 revenue increased 116 over 2012 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2013 consolidated operating expenses increased 107 from 2012 compared to the 105 increase in revenue year over year this combination resulted in our 2013 operating ratio of 897 compared to 895 in 2012 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 129 in 2013 primarily due to the increase in load volume that increased services from thirdparty rail and truck carriers in addition our jbi segment increased the use of outsourced dray carriers resulting from a challenging driver market while our ics segment incurred higher rates paid to thirdparty carriers in 2013 due to a tighter thirdparty carrier environment the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 97 in 2013 from 2012 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand a tighter supply of qualified drivers and new longterm customer contracts partially offset by lower overall office personnel compensation and a reduction in driver pay within our jbt segment due to fleet reduction 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 21 in 2013 compared with 2012 due to decreases in the price of fuel depreciation and amortization expense increased 106 in 2013 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand as well as additional equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts these increases were partially offset by the reduction in the jbt tractor fleet operating supplies and expenses increased 135 driven primarily by increased general maintenance costs resulting from growth in equipment fleets and a higher cost per unit increased toll activity and implementation related costs incurred for new dcs longterm customers in 2013 insurance and claims expense increased 25 for 2013 primarily due to an increase in incident volume offset by a reduction in accident severity the 670 increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in net gains from asset sales higher building and facility rental expense related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and increased bad debt expense due to two customer bankruptcies net gains from the disposal of assets were 5 million in 2013 compared with 17 million in 2012 

  

net interest expense for 2013 decreased by 95 compared with 2012 due to both reduced average debt levels and lower interest rates 

  

our effective income tax rate was 3815 in 2013 and 3850 in 2012 the decrease in 2013 was primarily related to the realization of a deferred tax benefit on the sale of property during the second quarter of 2013 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue increased 125 to 346 billion in 2013 from 307 billion in 2012 primarily due to a 126 increase in load volume excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 134 in 2013 over the prior year revenue per load was unchanged in 2013 when compared to 2012 and average length of haul remained virtually flat 

  

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 447 million in 2013 from 375 million in 2012 primarily due to volume growth improved container utilization and lower office personnel compensation costs partially offset by increased outsourced drayage and rail purchased transportation costs and by higher driver procurement and retention expenses 

  

  

 

 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 141 to 123 billion in 2013 from 108 billion in 2012 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 162 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily from new longterm contracts related to the conversion of customers’ private fleets dcs ended 2013 with a net additional 1154 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2012 

  

operating income decreased to 110 million in 2013 compared with 116 million in 2012 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher driver and other personnel pay increased equipment and maintenance costs increased purchased transportation expenses lower gains on equipment sales increased insurance and claims costs and increased bad debt expense in addition dcs incurred significant implementation costs for new longterm customers during 2013 these implementation costs include but are not limited to driver and management hiring and relocation costs personnel travel costs equipment repositioning costs technology design and integration and telecommunication and operational system infrastructure 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue grew 176 to 537 million in 2013 from 456 million in 2012 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 191 increase in load volume in 2013 when compared to 2012 partially offset by a slight reduction in revenue per load both transactional and contractual business experienced increased load volumes 

  

operating income remained flat at 16 million in 2013 when compared to 2012 ics gross profit margin declined to 118 for 2013 from 130 for 2012 due to higher purchased transportation costs resulting from a tightening thirdparty carrier environment cost increases for additional headcount and branch network expansion also offset increases in revenues 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue decreased 192 to 391 million in 2013 from 484 million in 2012 primarily due to lower equipment utilization shorter length of haul and an 113 reduction in tractors yearoveryear primarily from a reduction in independent contractor capacity excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2013 decreased 195 compared to 2012 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 4 million in 2013 compared with 23 million in 2012 this decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower revenue increased driver and independent contractor pay higher maintenance and equipment cost per unit and fewer gains on equipment sales partially offset by reductions in office personnel   

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 647 million in 2014 and 574 million in 2013 this increase in 2014 was primarily due to increased earnings and the timing of general working capital activities offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes during the current year the increase in taxes paid in 2014 was due to the effect of timing differences caused by the expiration of federal tax bonus depreciation in december 2013 in december 2014 federal tax bonus depreciation was enacted for 2014 but this law change occurred after all estimated tax payments had been made for the current year 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 660 million in 2014 compared with 443 million in 2013 the increase resulted primarily from an increase in equipment purchases in 2014 partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of equipment during the same period 

  

  

 

 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 13 million in 2014 compared to net cash used of 132 million in 2013 this change resulted primarily from the proceeds from longterm debt issuances in 2014 partially offset by longterm debt repayments and an increase in dividends paid and treasury stock purchased 

  

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 014 per share quarterly dividend in 2012 a 015 per share quarterly dividend in 2013 with the first quarter dividend being pulled forward and paid in fourth quarter 2012 and a 020 per share quarterly dividend in 2014 on january 29 2015 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 020 to 021 per share which will be paid february 26 2015 to stockholders of record on february 12 2015 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtain capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment 

  

at december 31 2014 we were authorized to borrow up to 500 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in august 2016 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2014 we had 183 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 112 under this agreement 

  

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first issuance is 250 million of 3375 senior notes which mature in september 2015 with interest payments due semiannually in march and september of each year the second and third issuances are 250 million of 240 senior notes due march 2019 and 250 million of 385 senior notes due march 2024 respectively both of which were issued in march 2014 interest payments under both notes are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning september 2014 we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 to a variable rate the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on libor plus an established margin resulting in an interest rate of 109 at december 31 2014 

  

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2014 for all debt facilities maturing in 2015 it is our intent to pay the entire outstanding balances in full on or before the maturity dates using our existing senior revolving line of credit or other sources of longterm financing 

  

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 

  

we are currently committed to spend approximately 555 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2015 which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers chassis and tractors 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 270 million of obligations primarily related to facility leases 

  

  

 

 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2014 

  

   

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2014 

  

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 44 million at december 31 2014 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2015 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 351 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding our total longterm debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 240 to 385 these fixedrate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus any applicable margins we currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts our 250 million of 240 fixedrate senior notes due march 2019 to a variable rate the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on libor plus an established margin our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 43 million 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuelprice increases as of december 31 2014 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

    

 

 

  

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2013 we had 18467 employees which consisted of 12632 company drivers 4651 office personnel and 1184 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1313 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

revenue equipment 

  

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers 

  

as of december 31 2013 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 10453 units in addition we had approximately 1313 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2013 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 27 years while our containers averaged 47 years of age and our trailers averaged 103 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities 

  

competition and the industry 

  

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

  

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

  

in 2011 the fmcsa amended the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers the remaining provisions of the hos final rule became effective july 1 2013 while we continue to evaluate and adjust to the impact of the final rule on various segments of our operations we have experienced some negative impact on our productivity 

    

 

 

  

in 2011 the fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking to require currently logging drivers to complete their logs using an electronic onboard recorder eobr the final rule regarding this proposal is expected to be published in the first quarter of 2014 since the issuance of this proposal we have successfully implemented a plan to replace any legacy onboard recording equipment within our fleets we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

  

in 2013 the fmcsa in conjunction with the national highway traffic safety administration submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking to require the installation of speedlimiting devices on heavy trucks the final rule regarding this proposal is expected to be published in the third quarter of 2014 we believe this rule will have minimal implementation cost as all of our heavy trucks subject to this rule already have these devices installed we do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

  

in february 2014 the fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking establishing a commercial driver’s license drug and alcohol clearinghouse this rule will establish a database of commercial driver´s license holders that have failed or refused a controlled substance or alcohol test the rule will require carriers to report positive test results and refusals to test into the clearinghouse and query the database when hiring drivers we anticipate that the establishment of the clearinghouse may create efficiencies within our driver hiring process 

  

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries or license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions disruption or failure of information systems increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

    

 

 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our ics and jbt business segments utilize third parties to complete their services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from use of our trailing equipment to fulfill jbt loads and periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain ics loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2013 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

  

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2014 with substantially the same terms as our 2013 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2013 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 29 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a longterm written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

    

 

 

  

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers delivery personnel and thirdparty carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

  

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins 

  

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

  

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

  

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs 

  

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type we have policies in place for 2014 with substantially the same terms as our 2013 policies for personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and cargo loss or damage 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and if applicable conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2013 we had an accrual of approximately 59 million for estimated claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2013 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 49 million which represented prefunded premiums 

  

revenue equipment 

  

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2013 

    

 

 

  

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

  

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

  

income taxes 

  

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

  

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

  

 

 

  

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

   

2013 compared with 2012 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues were 56 billion in 2013 a 105 increase over 2012 primarily due to increased load volume fuel surcharge fsc revenues increased to 11 billion in 2013 compared with 997 million in 2012 due to overall increased load volumes if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2013 revenue increased 116 over 2012 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2013 consolidated operating expenses increased 107 from 2012 compared to the 105 increase in revenue year over year this combination resulted in our 2013 operating ratio of 897 compared to 895 in 2012 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 129 in 2013 primarily due to the increase in load volume that increased services from thirdparty rail and truck carriers in addition our jbi segment increased the use of outsourced dray carriers resulting from a challenging driver market while our ics segment incurred higher rates paid to thirdparty carriers in 2013 due to a tighter thirdparty carrier environment the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 97 in 2013 from 2012 this increase was primarily related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand a tighter supply of qualified drivers and new longterm customer contracts partially offset by lower overall office personnel compensation and a reduction in driver pay within our jbt segment due to fleet reduction 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 21 in 2013 compared with 2012 due to decreases in the price of fuel we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may adjust fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

    

 

 

  

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased 106 in 2013 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment tractor container and chassis fleets to support additional business demand as well as additional equipment purchased related to new dcs longterm customer contracts these increases were partially offset by the reduction in the jbt tractor fleet operating supplies and expenses increased 135 driven primarily by increased general maintenance costs resulting from growth in equipment fleets and a higher cost per unit increased toll activity and implementation related costs incurred for new dcs longterm customers in 2013 insurance and claims expense increased 25 for 2013 primarily due to an increase in incident volume offset by a reduction in accident severity the 670 increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in net gains from asset sales higher building and facility rental expense related to new dcs longterm customer contracts and increased bad debt expense due to two customer bankruptcies net gains from the disposal of assets were 5 million in 2013 compared with 17 million in 2012 

  

net interest expense for 2013 decreased by 95 compared with 2012 due to both reduced average debt levels and lower interest rates 

  

our effective income tax rate was 3815 in 2013 and 3850 in 2012 the decrease in 2013 was primarily related to the realization of a deferred tax benefit on the sale of property during the second quarter of 2013 we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 3800 and 3850 for calendar year 2014 

  

segments 

  

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2013 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

  

  

   

 

 

  

operating data by segment 

  

   

       

 

 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue increased 125 to 346 billion in 2013 from 307 billion in 2012 primarily due to a 126 increase in load volume excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 134 in 2013 over the prior year revenue per load was unchanged in 2013 when compared to 2012 and average length of haul remained virtually flat 

  

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 447 million in 2013 from 375 million in 2012 primarily due to volume growth improved container utilization and lower office personnel compensation costs partially offset by increased outsourced drayage and rail purchased transportation costs and by higher driver procurement and retention expenses 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 141 to 123 billion in 2013 from 108 billion in 2012 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 162 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily from new longterm contracts related to the conversion of customers’ private fleets dcs ended 2013 with a net additional 1154 revenueproducing trucks when compared to 2012 

  

operating income decreased to 110 million in 2013 compared with 116 million in 2012 the decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher driver and other personnel pay increased equipment and maintenance costs increased purchased transportation expenses lower gains on equipment sales increased insurance and claims costs and increased bad debt expense in addition dcs incurred significant implementation costs for new longterm customers during 2013 these implementation costs include but are not limited to driver and management hiring and relocation costs personnel travel costs equipment repositioning costs technology design and integration and telecommunication and operational system infrastructure a portion of this increased cost is expected to be ongoing until the fleets for these new accounts are operating in the manner for which they were designed with the customer 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue grew 176 to 537 million in 2013 from 456 million in 2012 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 191 increase in load volume in 2013 when compared to 2012 partially offset by a slight reduction in revenue per load both transactional and contractual business experienced increased load volumes 

  

operating income remained flat at 16 million in 2013 when compared to 2012 ics gross profit margin declined to 118 for 2013 from 130 for 2012 due to higher purchased transportation costs resulting from a tightening thirdparty carrier environment cost increases for additional headcount and branch network expansion also offset increases in revenues 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue decreased 192 to 391 million in 2013 from 484 million in 2012 primarily due to lower equipment utilization shorter length of haul and an 113 reduction in tractors yearoveryear primarily from a reduction in independent contractor capacity excluding fuel surcharges revenue for 2013 decreased 195 compared to 2012 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 4 million in 2013 compared with 23 million in 2012 this decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower revenue increased driver and independent contractor pay higher maintenance and equipment cost per unit and fewer gains on equipment sales partially offset by reductions in office personnel 

    

 

 

  

2012 compared with 2011 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues were 51 billion in 2012 an 117 increase over 2011 higher fuel prices during 2012 and overall increased load volume resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 997 million in 2012 compared with 849 million in 2011 if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2012 revenue increased 103 over 2011 driven primarily by our consolidated load growth 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our 2012 consolidated operating expenses increased 108 from 2011 compared to the 117 increase in revenue year over year this combination resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to 895 from 902 in 2011 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 171 in 2012 primarily due to the increase in load volume that increased services from thirdparty rail and truck carriers in addition rates paid to thirdparty carriers in 2012 increased when compared to 2011 due to a tighter supply of qualified providers and the higher price of fuel since fuel costs of thirdparty rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 36 in 2012 from 2011 this increase primarily related to increases in driver pay caused by increased business demand and a tighter supply of qualified drivers and an increase in overall employee health care costs partially offset by decreases in office personnel compensation costs 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense remained relatively flat increasing only 05 in 2012 compared with 2011 due to increases in fuel prices being offset by improved fuel efficiency and fewer company road miles 

  

depreciation and amortization expense increased 71 in 2012 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment container and chassis fleet to support additional business demand as well as truck and tractor growth and trades in our jbi dcs and jbt segments operating supplies and expenses increased 113 driven primarily by toll rate increases and increased tire cost and usage insurance and claims expense increased 198 for 2012 primarily due to increased accident severity and customer cargo claims the 58 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in bad debt expense due to a 2011 customer bankruptcy and an increase in net gains from asset sales net gains from sale of revenue equipment were 17 million in 2012 compared with 14 million in 2011 

  

net interest expense for 2012 decreased by 103 compared with 2011 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in debt levels and lower interest rates 

  

our effective income tax rate was 385 in 2012 and 382 in 2011 the increase in 2012 was primarily related to an increase in the provision for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue increased 149 to 307 billion in 2012 from 267 billion in 2011 primarily due to a 134 increase in load volume excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 138 in 2012 over the prior year 

  

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 375 million in 2012 from 301 million in 2011 primarily due to volume growth partially offset by increased purchased transportation cost and driver wages 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue increased 47 to 108 billion in 2012 from 103 billion in 2011 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 39 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily from new contracts awarded 

    

 

 

  

operating income increased to 116 million in 2012 compared with 103 million in 2011 this increase was due to the increased revenue transfer of assets to more profitable accounts and increased gains on equipment dispositions partially offset by increased driver wages insurance and claims expense and employee health care costs additionally our dcs segment operating income for 2011 was reduced by a charge related to a customer bankruptcy 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue grew 282 to 456 million in 2012 from 356 million in 2011 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume in both contractual and transactional business 

  

operating income increased to 16 million in 2012 compared with 13 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to increased revenues partially offset by cost increases for additional headcount branch network expansion and a single large cargo claim settlement ics gross profit margin declined to 13 for 2012 from 135 for 2011 attributable to increased rates paid to thirdparty carriers which was the result of a tighter supply of qualified purchased transportation providers 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue decreased 4 to 484 million in 2012 from 504 million in 2011 excluding surcharges revenue for 2012 decreased 48 compared to 2011 on a 19 reduction in tractors yearoveryear increases in customer rates and load volume were offset by a reduction in average length of haul and fewer paid empty miles 

  

jbt segment had operating income of 23 million in 2012 compared with 27 million in 2011 this decrease in operating income was primarily due to decreased revenue increased independent contractor costs and fewer gains on equipment sales partially offset by overall cost decreases related to the reduction in the segment’s tractor fleet 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

net cash provided by operating activities was 574 million in 2013 and 548 million in 2012 this increase in 2013 was primarily due to increased earnings offset by the timing of the collection of trade and income tax receivables and an increase in prepaid expenses included in other assets 

  

cash flows used in investing activities relate primarily to purchases of revenue equipment net of proceeds from disposals the increase to 443 million in 2013 from 370 million in 2012 is the result of an increase in additions to and replacements of revenue equipment primarily within our jbi and dcs segments combined with fewer proceeds from asset sales 

  

net cash used in financing activities decreased to 132 million in 2013 from 178 million in 2012 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings on our revolving line of credit and decrease in dividends paid partially offset by payments on our longterm debt and an increase in treasury stock purchases 

  

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition liquidity earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 013 per share quarterly dividend in 2011 a 014 per share quarterly dividend in 2012 and a 015 per share quarterly dividend in 2013 with the first quarter dividend being pulled forward and paid in fourth quarter 2012 on january 29 2014 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 015 to 020 per share which will be paid february 27 2014 to stockholders of record on february 13 2014 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

    

 

 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtain capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment 

  

at december 31 2013 we were authorized to borrow up to 500 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in august 2016 this senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2013 we had 2087 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 112 under this agreement 

  

our senior term loan at december 31 2013 consists of an unsecured 150 million variablerate agreement which matures in march 2014 the entire 150 million balance is payable at maturity the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2013 the interest rate on this facility was 117 

  

our senior notes consist of two separate issuances the first is 100 million of 608 senior notes which mature in july 2014 the entire 100 million balance is payable at maturity interest payments are due semiannually in january and july the second is 250 million of 3375 senior notes which mature in september 2015 the entire 250 million balance is payable at maturity interest payments are due semiannually in march and september we have the option to redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture 

  

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2013 for all debt facilities maturing in 2014 it is our intent to pay the entire outstanding balances in full on or before the maturity dates using our existing senior revolving line of credit or other sources of longterm financing 

  

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future our debttoequity ratio decreased from 2012 due to an increase in equity as a result of currentyear earnings which is partially offset by an increase in treasury stock purchases in 2013 

  

we are currently committed to spend approximately 607 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2014 which is primarily related to the acquisition of containers chassis and tractors 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 315 million of obligations primarily related to facility leases 

    

 

 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

  

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2013 

  

   

   

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 45 million at december 31 2013 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2014 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 339 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding of our total 7084 million of debt we had 3587 million of variablerate debt outstanding at december 31 2013 under our revolving lines of credit and our senior term loan these have variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a onepercentagepoint increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 36 million our remaining debt is fixedrate debt and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense periodically we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates however at december 31 2013 we had no such derivative financial instruments in place 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2013 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

operating segments 

 

segment information is also included in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

jbi segment 

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint service environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services “drayage” are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while utilizing thirdparty dray carriers where economical by performing our own drayage services we are able to provide a costcompetitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers 

 

  

  

 

jbi operates 58962 pieces of companyowned trailing equipment systemwide the fleet primarily consists of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality the company also owns and maintains its own chassis fleet consisting of 55361 pieces the containers and chassis are uniquely designed so that they may only be paired together which the company feels creates operational competitive advantage jbi also manages a fleet of 3124 companyowned tractors 472 independent contractor trucks and 3859 company drivers who maintain our high service standards at december 31 2012 the total jbi employee count was 4299 revenue for the jbi segment in 2012 was 31 billion 

dcs segment 

dcs focuses on private fleet conversion and creation in finalmile delivery replenishment and specialized equipment and services we also specialize in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions that support a variety of transportation networks our finalmile delivery services are supported with a network of approximately 88 crossdock locations nationwide with 98 of the continental us population living within 150 miles of a crossdock location our customer contracts are longterm ranging from three to 10 years with the average being approximately 3 12 years pricing of our contracts typically involves costplus arrangements with our fixed costs being recovered regardless of equipment utilization but are customized based on invested capital and duration 

at december 31 2012 this segment operated 4844 companyowned trucks 394 customerowned trucks and 15 independent contractor trucks the dcs segment employed 7166 people at december 31 2012 5907 of whom were drivers dcs revenue for 2012 was 11 billion 

ics segment 

ics provides traditional freight brokerage and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers that desire to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates 15 remote sales offices or branches as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers 

at december 31 2012 the ics segment employed 453 people with a carrier base of approximately 32300 ics revenue for 2012 was 456 million 

jbt segment 

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers 

at december 31 2012 the jbt segment operated 1192 companyowned tractors and employed 1674 people 1282 of whom were drivers at december 31 2012 we had 901 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment some of whom were leasing companyowned tractors jbt revenue for 2012 was 484 million 

  

  

  

marketing and operations 

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts electronics and chemicals our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of fortune 500 companies we provide a broad range of transportation services to shippers seeking to use a variety of transportation options to optimize their supplychain logistics needs 

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

people 

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2012 we had 16475 employees which consisted of 11048 company drivers 4300 office personnel and 1127 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1388 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

revenue equipment 

our jbi segment utilizes uniquely designed highcube containers and chassis which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers 

as of december 31 2012 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 9160 units in addition we had approximately 1388 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe that operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2012 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 26 years our containers averaged 43 years of age and our trailers averaged 95 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities 

effective with modelyear 2010 engines the epa has mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractors the 2010 epacompliant engines have shown no material decrease in miles per gallon and a slight increase in operating costs due to more stringent maintenance procedures compared with prior engine standards due to exhaust gas recirculation egr and selective catalytic reduction scr technology which achieve lower emissions 

competition and the industry 

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment attracts competition from customers’ private fleets other private fleet outsourcing companies equipment leasing companies local and regional delivery service providers and some truckload carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

 

  

  

 

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service availability and type of equipment capacity and availability of carriers for logistics services 

regulation 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

in february 2011 the fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking to require currently logging drivers to complete their logs using an electronic onboard recorder eobr and accepted comments from the public this proposal is ongoing 

in december 2011 the fmcsa amended the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers some provisions of the hos final rule became effective february 27 2012 others are effective july 1 2013 while we are currently evaluating the impact of the final rule on various segments of our operations to determine implications we expect some negative impact on our productivity 

in july 2012 president obama signed into law the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map21 which included a variety of requirements relating to the transportation industry we are currently evaluating the impact of map21 but do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity 

we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

our business is subject to general economic and business factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures 

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

  

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with a number of class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ics and jbt business segments utilize third parties to complete their services these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from use of our trailing equipment to fulfill jbt loads and periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain ics loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2012 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have policies in place for 2013 with substantially the same terms as our 2012 policies for personal injury workers’ compensation cargo and property damage with the exception of changing to a 100000 deductible per claim for workers’ compensation coverage we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2012 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 30 of our revenue our jbi ics and jbt segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a longterm written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

  

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

significant changes in hoursofservice regulations and other motor carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping equipment in december 2011 the fmcsa amended the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers some provisions of the hos final rule became effective february 27 2012 others are effective july 1 2013 while we are currently evaluating the impact of the final rule on various segments of our operations to determine implications we expect some negative impact on our productivity 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers delivery personnel and thirdparty carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

we are a defendant in certain classaction lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are current and former californiabased drivers who allege claims for unpaid wages failure to provide meal and rest periods and other items further proceedings had been stayed in these matters pending the california supreme court’s decision in a case unrelated to ours involving similar issues during the second quarter of 2012 the california supreme court issued its decision in this unrelated case and during the fourth quarter of 2012 we filed a motion to decertify the class which was heard and denied we intend to file a motion to stay further proceedings pending a decision in the ninth circuit court of appeals on yet another unrelated case but again with similar issues we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss if any that may arise from these lawsuits

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type for 2010 through 2012 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for substantially all workers’ compensation claims we have policies in place for 2013 with substantially the same terms as our 2012 policies for personal injury workers’ compensation cargo and property damage with the exception of adding a 100000 deductible per claim for workers’ compensation coverage 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes a contractual premium adjustment factor if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and if applicable conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2012 we had an accrual of approximately 38 million for estimated claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2012 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 35 million which represented prefunded premiums 

revenue equipment 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers chassis and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment that is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2012 

  

  

  

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

  

  

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

 

 

 

2012 compared with 2011 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues were 51 billion in 2012 an 117 increase over 2011 higher fuel prices during the current year and overall increased load volume resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 997 million in 2012 compared with 849 million in 2011 if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2012 revenue increased 103 over 2011 driven primarily by our consolidated load growth in the current year 

consolidated operating expenses 

our 2012 consolidated operating expenses increased 108 from 2011 compared to the 117 increase in revenue year over year this combination resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to 895 from 902 in 2011 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 171 in 2012 primarily due to the increase in load volume that increased services from thirdparty rail and truck carriers in addition rates paid to thirdparty carriers in 2012 increased when compared to 2011 due to a tighter supply of qualified providers and the higher price of fuel since fuel costs of thirdparty rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 36 in 2012 from 2011 this increase primarily related to increases in driver pay caused by increased business demand and a tighter supply of qualified drivers and an increase in overall employee health care costs partially offset by decreases in office personnel compensation costs 

fuel and fuel taxes expense remained relatively flat increasing only 05 in 2012 compared with 2011 due to increases in fuel prices being offset by improved fuel efficiency and fewer company road miles during the current year we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

 

  

  

 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 71 in 2012 primarily due to additions to our jbi segment container and chassis fleet to support additional business demand as well as truck and tractor growth and trades in our jbi dcs and jbt segments operating supplies and expenses increased 113 driven primarily by toll rate increases and increased tire cost and usage insurance and claims expense increased 198 for 2012 primarily due to increased accident severity and customer cargo claims the 58 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in bad debt expense due to a 2011 customer bankruptcy and an increase in net gains from asset sales net gains from sale of revenue equipment were 17 million in 2012 compared with 14 million in 2011 

net interest expense for 2012 decreased by 103 compared with 2011 this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in debt levels and lower interest rates 

our effective income tax rate was 385 in 2012 and 382 in 2011 the increase in 2012 was primarily related to an increase in the provision for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 380 and 385 for calendar year 2013 

segments 

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2012 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

3 includes companyowned independent contractor and customerowned trucks 

  

  

  

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue increased 149 to 307 billion in 2012 from 267 billion in 2011 primarily due to a 134 increase in load volume excluding fuel surcharge revenues increased 138 in 2012 over the prior year 

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 375 million in 2012 from 301 million in 2011 primarily due to volume growth partially offset by increased purchased transportation cost and driver wages 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue increased 47 to 108 billion in 2012 from 103 billion in 2011 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 39 in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily from new contracts awarded 

operating income increased to 116 million in 2012 compared with 103 million in 2011 this increase was due to the increased revenue transfer of assets to more profitable accounts and increased gains on equipment dispositions partially offset by increased driver wages insurance and claims expense and employee health care costs additionally our dcs segment operating income for 2011 was reduced by a charge related to a customer bankruptcy 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 282 to 456 million in 2012 from 356 million in 2011 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume in both contractual and transactional business 

operating income increased to 16 million in 2012 compared with 13 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to increased revenues partially offset by cost increases for additional headcount branch network expansion and a single large cargo claim settlement ics gross profit margin declined to 13 for 2012 from 135 for 2011 attributable to increased rates paid to thirdparty carriers which was the result of a tighter supply of qualified purchased transportation providers 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue decreased 4 to 484 million in 2012 from 504 million in 2011 excluding surcharges revenue for 2012 decreased 48 compared to 2011 on a 19 reduction in tractors yearoveryear increases in customer rates and load volume were offset by a reduction in average length of haul and fewer paid empty miles 

jbt segment had operating income of 23 million in 2012 compared with 27 million in 2011 this decrease in operating income was primarily due to decreased revenue increased independent contractor costs and fewer gains on equipment sales partially offset by overall cost decreases related to the reduction in the segment’s tractor fleet 

2011 compared with 2010 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues were 45 billion in 2011 a 193 increase over 2010 significantly higher fuel prices and increased load volume resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 849 million in 2011 compared with 516 million in 2010 if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2011 revenue increased 12 over 2010 revenue in all operating segments increased over 2010 with consolidated load growth and rate improvements contributing to the increase in revenues 

  

  

 

consolidated operating expenses 

our 2011 consolidated operating expenses increased 185 from 2010 compared to the 193 increase in revenue year over year this combination resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to 902 from 908 in 2010 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 241 in 2011 this increase was the result of higher rates paid and the higher price of fuel since fuel costs of thirdparty rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense as well as an increase in load volume that increased services from these thirdparty rail and truck carriers the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 100 in 2011 from 2010 this increase primarily related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand additionally we previously reactivated and increased certain compensation and benefit programs which contributed to the increase over the prior year 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 349 in 2011 primarily due to a 30 higher fuel cost per gallon and higher load volume we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 86 in 2011 primarily due to additions to our container and chassis fleet to support additional business demand as well as truck and tractor growth and trades operating supplies and expenses increased 52 primarily due to toll and tire expenses related to increased activity and increased miles insurance and claims expense decreased 69 for 2011 primarily due to reduced accident severity  the 219 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in charitable contributions and an increase in gains from asset dispositions partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense due to a customer bankruptcy and additional expense related to severance agreements for executive retirees net gains from sale of revenue equipment were 14 million in 2011 compared with 4 million in 2010 

net interest expense for 2011 increased by 20 compared with 2010 this increase was primarily due to an increase in debt levels partially offset by lower interest rates 

our effective income tax rate was 382 in 2011 and 376 in 2010 the increase in 2011 was primarily related to an increase in state tax rates 

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue increased 248 to 267 billion in 2011 from 214 billion in 2010 primarily due to a 161 increase in load volume and a 43 increase in rates 

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 301 million in 2011 from 237 million in 2010 primarily due to volume growth and price increases 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue increased 137 to 103 billion in 2011 from 907 million in 2010 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 86 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in productivity and truck count as a result of new contracts awarded 

  

  

  

operating income increased to 103 million in 2011 compared with 83 million in 2010 this increase was due to reductions in insurance and claims costs  the transfer of assets to more profitable accounts improved cost controls and new contracts awarded 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 223 to 356 million in 2011 from 291 million in 2010 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume and higher pricing in both contractual and transactional business and an increase in the cost of fuel 

operating income increased to 13 million in 2011 compared with 9 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased revenues lower overhead costs and operating leverage gained from a more experienced workforce 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue increased 51 to 504 million in 2011 from 479 million in 2010 revenue excluding fuel surcharges remained relatively flat in 2011 compared to 2010 increases in rates were offset by a reduction in average tractor count and reduced load volume 

jbt segment had operating income of 27 million in 2011 compared with 19 million in 2010 this was mainly a result of increased rates and gains on equipment disposals partially offset by increases in driver compensation during 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was 548 million in 2012 636 million in 2011 and 428 million in 2010 the decrease in 2012 cash provided by operating activities relative to 2011 was primarily due to the increase in cash paid for income taxes during the current period when compared to 2011 due to the effect of timing differences caused by the use of 100 bonus depreciation within the company’s 2011 corporate tax filings also contributing to the decrease was the timing of payments related to trade accounts payable and other accrued expenses 

cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to additions to our revenue equipment fleet net of proceeds from disposals the decreased level of cash used for equipment additions during 2012 was due to the timing of these purchases 

net cash used in financing activities during 2012 decreased from 2011 primarily due to a decrease in our treasury stock repurchases partially offset by payments on our longterm debt and revolving lines of credit and an increase in dividends paid 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 012 per share quarterly dividend in 2010 a 013 per share quarterly dividend in 2011 and a 014 per share quarterly dividend in 2012 on december 7 2012 we announced an increase and a pullforward of our regular quarterly dividend typically paid in february of each calendar year the increase announced was from 014 to 015 which was paid december 28 2012 to stockholders of record on december 17 2012 we do not expect to declare or pay a quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2013 and intend to resume paying quarterly cash dividends in the second quarter of 2013 however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

liquidity 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers and chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have during the past few years obtained capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment 

 

  

  

 

at december 31 2012 we were authorized to borrow up to 500 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks this senior credit facility which has a fiveyear term expiring in august 2016 allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2012 we had 858 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 203 under this agreement 

our senior term loan consists of an unsecured 200 million variablerate agreement which matures in march 2014 we are required to make an installment payment of 50 million in march 2013 with the remaining 150 million payable at maturity the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2012 we had 200 million outstanding under this variablerate senior term loan facility at an interest rate of 126 

at december 31 2012 our senior notes consist of two separate issuances the first is 150 million of 608 senior notes which mature in july 2014 we are required to make an installment payment of 50 million in july 2013 with the remainder due upon maturity interest payments are due semiannually in january and july of each year the second is 250 million of 3375 senior notes which mature september 2015 with interest payments due semiannually in march and september of each year we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2012 

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future our debttoequity ratio decreased from 2011 due to a decrease in debt levels and an increase in equity due to currentyear earnings and a reduction in our treasury stock repurchases in 2012 

we are currently committed to spend approximately 283 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2013 which is primarily related to containers and chassis and tractors 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 211 million of obligations primarily related to facilities leases 

contractual obligations and commitments

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 50 million at december 31 2012 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2013 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 298 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding of our total 6853 million of debt we had 2858 million of variablerate debt outstanding at december 31 2012 under our revolving lines of credit and our senior term loan these have variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a one percentage point increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 29 million our remaining debt is fixedrate debt and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense periodically we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates however at december 31 2012 we had no such derivative financial instruments in place 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2012 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

as always we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all of our operations as safely as possible 

operating segments 

 

segment information is also included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

jbi segment 

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services “drayage” are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while utilizing thirdparty dray carriers where economical by performing our own drayage services we are able to provide a costcompetitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers 

 

  

  

 

jbi operates 54506 pieces of companycontrolled trailing equipment systemwide the fleet is primarily consists of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality jbi also manages a fleet of 2901 companyowned tractors and 3504 company drivers who maintain our high service standards at december 31 2011 the total jbi employee count was 3893 revenue for the jbi segment in 2011 was 27 billion 

dcs segment 

dcs specializes in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions which support a variety of transportation networks our designs are developed and customized to provide assigned equipment and labor industryleading service levels optimum efficiency and costsaving management dcs focuses on finalmile delivery replenishment and specialized services supporting private fleet conversion dedicated fleet creation and transportation system augmentation we have continued to expand our specialized service offerings in the finalmile delivery services with approximately 90 crossdock locations to date our operations are managed on site by transportation professionals who work in concert daily with customers and delivery specialists to ensure safe and costeffective delivery operations are governed by longerterm contracts that typically include fixed cost components and fuel surcharge programs on roundtrip miles 

at december 31 2011 this segment operated 4571 companyowned trucks 330 customerowned trucks and 17 independent contractor trucks the dcs segment employed 6418 people at december 31 2011 dcs revenue for 2011 was 10 billion 

jbt segment 

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers 

at december 31 2011 the jbt segment operated 1637 companyowned tractors and employed 2135 people 1743 of whom were drivers at december 31 2011 we had 948 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment some of whom were leasing companyowned tractors jbt revenue for 2011 was 504 million 

ics segment 

ics provides nonasset assetlight and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers that desire to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates 11 remote sales offices or branches as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers 

at december 31 2011 the ics segment employed 384 people with a carrier base of approximately 28800 ics revenue for 2011 was 356 million 

marketing and operations 

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts electronics and chemicals our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of fortune 500 companies we provide a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers seeking to use a limited number of “core” carriers and those desiring a provider of complementary services as a way to meet all of their supplychain needs 

 

  

  

 

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

people 

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2011 we had 15631 employees which consisted of 10511 company drivers 3982 office personnel and 1138 maintenance technicians we also had arrangements with approximately 1178 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

revenue equipment 

our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment 

as of december 31 2011 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 9109 units in addition we had approximately 1178 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe that operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2011 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 28 years our containers averaged 44 years of age and our trailers averaged 94 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities 

effective with modelyear 2010 engines the epa has mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractors the 2010 epacompliant engines are expected to have no decrease in miles per gallon and a slight increase in operating costs due to more stringent maintenance procedures compared with prior engine standards due to exhaust gas recirculation egr technology which achieves lower emissions 

competition and the industry 

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service and to a certain extent some railroads directly considering the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment competition ranges from large diversified carriers to local transportation and delivery service providers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers 

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service revenue equipment quality and availability of carriers for logistics services 

 

  

  

 

regulation 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

in december 2010 the fmcsa began reporting to the public through its website specific carrier safety ranking statistics for more than 500000 transportation companies in connection with its compliance safety accountability csa program the csa reporting process tracks and reports data on specific carriers including moving violations outofservice events and ontheroad inspections csa also accumulates information about commercial drivers however individual driver information is only available to carriers and others that subscribe to a reporting service our current csa scores meet or exceed the fmcsa’s requirements for acceptable performance as this csa carrier and driver information continues to become more readily available to shippers consignees brokers carriers and other parties it is expected that certain carriers and drivers will exit the transportation industry 

on february 1 2011 the fmcsa published a notice of proposed rulemaking to require currently logging drivers to complete their logs using an electronic onboard recorder eobr and accepted comments from the public this proposal is ongoing 

in december 2011 the fmcsa amended the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers some provisions of the hos final rule become effective february 27 2012 others july 1 2013 fmcsa’s final rule will have a negative impact on productivity we are currently evaluating the impact of the final rule on various segments of our operations to determine more specific productivity and safety implications 

we are in the process of evaluating all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations and will continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

our business is subject to general economic and business factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures 

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the trucking industry license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment surpluses in the market for used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

 

  

  

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ics business segment utilizes thirdparty carriers these third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements noted previously which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering the loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2011 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have renewed our policies for 2012 with substantially the same terms as our 2011 policies for personal injury workers’ compensation cargo and property damage we have significantly reduced the selfinsured portion of our workers’ compensation claims exposure and are fully insured for substantially all claims incurred since 2010 we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2011 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 32 of our revenue our jbi jbt and ics segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 

  

  

 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

significant changes in hoursofservice regulations and other motor carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping equipment in december 2011 the fmcsa amended the hoursofservice hos safety requirements for commercial truck drivers some provisions of the hos final rule become effective february 27 2012 others july 1 2013 fmcsa’s final rule will have a negative impact on productivity we continue to monitor the impact of new and proposed standards on acquisition and operating costs 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers delivery personnel and thirdparty carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured for periods prior to january 1 2010 certain policies include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period inception this contractual premium adjustment factor is used to convert the selfinsured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims for periods beginning january 1 2010 our personal injury and property damage policies no longer include these premium adjustment factors and the claim liability remains with us for the life of the claim 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type during 2009 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million for workers’ compensation for 2010 and 2011 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for substantially all workers’ compensation claims we have renewed our policies for 2012 with substantially the same terms as our 2011 policies for personal injury property damage and workers’ compensation 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above if applicable in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and if applicable conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2011 we had an accrual of approximately 42 million for estimated claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2011 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 30 million which represented prefunded premiums 

 

  

  

 

revenue equipment 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment that is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2011 

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers that have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

  

  

 

year in review 

 

our 2011 net earnings of 2570 million or 211 per diluted share were up 29 from the 1996 million or 156 per diluted share earned in 2010 the increase in earnings was due to all four business segments reporting increased operating income compared with 2010 our jbi and dcs segments combined represented 88 of the 966 million increase in consolidated operating income to 4442 million in 2011 from 3476 million in 2010 higher load count improved pricing and continued focus on cost reduction practices provided benefit throughout 2011 our response to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital enabled us to take advantage of load volume recovery in 2011 our 2011 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 902 compared with 908 in 2010 

significant events for calendar year 2011 include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

  

 

 

2011 compared with 2010 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues were 45 billion in 2011 a 193 increase over 2010 significantly higher fuel prices and increased load volume resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 849 million in 2011 compared with 516 million in 2010 if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2011 revenue increased 12 over 2010 revenue in all operating segments increased over 2010 with consolidated load growth and rate improvements contributing to the increase in revenues 

consolidated operating expenses 

our 2011 consolidated operating expenses increased 185 from 2010 compared to the 193 increase in revenue year over year this combination resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to 902 from 908 in 2010 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 241 in 2011 this increase was the result of higher rates paid and the higher price of fuel since fuel costs of thirdparty rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense as well as an increase in load volume that increased services from these thirdparty rail and truck carriers the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 100 in 2011 from 2010 this increase primarily related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand additionally we previously reactivated and increased certain compensation and benefit programs which contributed to the increase over the prior year 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 349 in 2011 primarily due to a 30 higher fuel cost per gallon and higher load volume we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

 

  

  

 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 86 in 2011 primarily due to additions to our container and chassis fleet to support additional business demand as well as truck and tractor growth and trades operating supplies and expenses increased 52 primarily due to toll and tire expenses related to increased activity and increased miles insurance and claims expense decreased 69 for 2011 primarily due to reduced accident severity  the 219 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease in charitable contributions and an increase in gains from asset dispositions partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense due to a customer bankruptcy and additional expense related to severance agreements for executive retirees net gains from sale of revenue equipment were 14 million in 2011 compared with 4 million in 2010 

net interest expense for 2011 increased by 20 compared with 2010 this increase was primarily due to an increase in debt levels partially offset by lower interest rates 

our effective income tax rate was 382 in 2011 and 376 in 2010 the increase in 2011 was primarily related to an increase in state tax rates we expect our effective income tax rate to be in the range of 380 to 385 for calendar year 2012 

segments 

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2011 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

 

 

 

  

1   includes pretax charges to write down the value of certain assets held for sale as follows 

66 million for jbi in 2009 37 million for dcs in 2009 

  

  

 

operating data by segment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 includes companyowned and independent contractor tractors 

2 using weighted workdays 

3 includes companyowned independent contractor and customerowned trucks 

  

  

  

  

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue increased 248 to 267 billion in 2011 from 214 billion in 2010 primarily due to a 161 increase in load volume and a 43 increase in rates 

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 301 million in 2011 from 237 million in 2010 primarily due to volume growth and price increases 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue increased 137 to 103 billion in 2011 from 907 million in 2010 revenue excluding fuel surcharges increased 86 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in productivity and truck count as a result of new contracts awarded 

operating income increased to 103 million in 2011 compared with 83 million in 2010 this increase was due to reductions in insurance and claims costs  the transfer of assets to more profitable accounts improved cost controls and new contracts awarded 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue increased 51 to 504 million in 2011 from 479 million in 2010 revenue excluding fuel surcharges remained relatively flat in 2011 compared to 2010 increases in rates were offset by a reduction in average tractor count and reduced load volume 

jbt segment had operating income of 27 million in 2011 compared with 19 million in 2010 this was mainly a result of increased rates and gains on equipment disposals partially offset by increases in driver compensation during 2011 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 223 to 356 million in 2011 from 291 million in 2010 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume and higher pricing in both contractual and transactional business and an increase in the cost of fuel 

operating income increased to 13 million in 2011 compared with 9 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to increased revenues lower overhead costs and operating leverage gained from a more experienced workforce 

2010 compared with 2009 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues were 38 billion in 2010 an 184 increase over 2009 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of 516 million in 2010 compared with 326 million in 2009 if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2010 revenue increased 14 over 2009 revenue in all operating segments increased over 2009 with consolidated load growth and rate improvements contributing to the increase in revenues 

consolidated operating expenses 

our 2010 consolidated operating expenses increased 166 from 2009 the impact of this increase and the 184 increase in 2010 revenue from 2009 resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to 908 from 923 in 2009 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 224 in 2010 as a result of higher load volume which increased services from these thirdparty rail and truck carriers in addition the higher price of fuel contributed to the increase in rents and purchased transportation costs since fuel costs of thirdparty rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 141 in 2010 from 2009 this increase was related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand and the increase in finalmile delivery service business compared with a year ago in addition we were able to reactivate and increase certain compensation and benefit programs for all of our employees in 2010 

 

  

  

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 257 in 2010 primarily due to a 23 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 42 in 2010 primarily due to additions to our jbi and dcs segments for power and trailing equipment in support of additional business demand insurance and claims expense decreased 50 for 2010 due to fewer cargo claim incidents and a lower cost per claim for casualty the 219 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the pretax writedown of 103 million recorded in 2009 related to assets held for sale this decrease was offset by increases in a charitable contribution and building rental expense in addition 2010 included a gain on asset sales of 4 million compared with losses on asset sales of 04 million in 2009 

net interest expense for 2010 increased by 21 compared with 2009 this increase was primarily due to increased outstanding debt balances offset slightly by reduced interest rates on our variablerate debt 

the “equity in operations of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of transplace inc tpi the change from 2009 is due to the sale of our interests in 2009 see note 12 affiliated company in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions 

our effective income tax rate was 376 in 2010 and 391 in 2009 the decrease in 2010 was primarily related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the impact in 2009 of the sale of our interests in tpi 

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue increased 214 to 214 billion in 2010 from 176 billion in 2009 a significant portion of this increase in revenue related to the 174 increase in load volume and improvement in revenue per load compared with 2009 

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 237 million in 2010 from 183 million in 2009 increased equipment utilization and higher revenues resulted in the operating income increase over 2009 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue increased 198 to 907 million in 2010 from 757 million in 2009 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in productivity and truck counts primarily related to growth in delivery and replenishment business this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the capacity business 

 

  

  

 

operating income increased to 83 million in 2010 compared with 63 million in 2009 this increase in operating income was due to the increased revenue and the improved leverage gained from those higher revenues 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue increased 73 to 479 million in 2010 from 447 million in 2009 this increase in revenue was primarily the result of increases in rates and longer lengths of haul compared with 2009 

our jbt segment had operating income of 19 million in 2010 compared with an operating loss of 11 million in 2009 this was mainly a result of increased rates and the impact of our network refinement and tractor fleet count reduction which allowed for effective cost control measures 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 123 to 291 million in 2010 from 259 million in 2009 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume and higher pricing in both contractual and transactional business 

operating income decreased to 9 million in 2010 compared with 13 million in 2009 the decrease primarily relates to higher transportation costs and fuel prices as well as new branch location costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was 636 million in 2011 428 million in 2010 and 357 million in 2009 the increase in 2011 cash provided by operating activities relative to 2010 after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation sharebased compensation and deferred income taxes was primarily due to increased earnings the timing of payments related to trade accounts payable and the collection of income taxes receivable these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash flows related to trade receivables due to timing of receipts 

cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to additions to our revenue equipment fleet net of proceeds from disposals the higher level of cash used for equipment additions during 2011 was associated with growth in the container and chassis fleet as well as truck and tractor growth and trades 

net cash used in financing activities during 2011 decreased from 2010 primarily due to fewer repayments on our revolving lines of credit a slight decrease in our treasury stock repurchases and increased borrowings from our revolving lines of credit in 2011 offset by an increase in dividends paid 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid an 011 per share quarterly dividend in 2009 a 012 per share quarterly dividend in 2010 and a 013 per share quarterly dividend in 2011 on february 2 2012 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 013 to 014 which was paid on february 24 2012 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

liquidity 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers and chassis trucks tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have during the past few years obtained capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases for revenue equipment 

 

  

  

 

on march 28 2011 we entered into a threeyear unsecured 200 million variablerate senior term loan agreement which matures in march 2014 proceeds were used for existing indebtedness payments and general working capital purposes we are required to make an installment payment of 50 million in march 2013 with the remaining 150 million payable at maturity the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2011 we had 200 million outstanding under this variablerate senior term loan facility at an interest rate of 139 

on august 12 2011 we replaced our 350 million senior revolving credit facility dated march 29 2007 with a new credit facility authorizing us to borrow up to 500 million under a senior revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks this new senior credit facility which has a fiveyear term expiring in august 2016 allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to 250 million and to request a oneyear extension of the maturity date the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees at december 31 2011 we had 998 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 154 under this agreement 

at december 31 2011 our senior notes consist of two separate issuances the first is 200 million of 608 senior notes which mature in july 2014 principal payments in the amount of 50 million are due in july 2012 and 2013 with the remainder due upon maturity interest payments are due semiannually in january and july of each year the second is 250 million of 3375 senior notes which mature september 2015 with interest payments due semiannually in march and september of each year we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture 200 million of 531 senior notes matured and were paid on march 29 2011 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2011 

we believe our liquid assets cash generated from operations and various financing arrangements will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future our debttoequity ratio increased from 2010 due to an increase in debt related to the current year issuance and a reduction in equity due to the share repurchase program 

we are currently committed to spend approximately 308 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2012 which is primarily related to containers and chassis 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 203 million of obligations primarily related to facilities leases 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2011 

 

 

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2011 

 

  

  

 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 85 million at december 31 2011 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2012 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 203 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding of our total 7492 million of debt we had 2998 million of variablerate debt outstanding at december 31 2011 under our revolving lines of credit and our senior term loan these have variable interest rates which are based on the prime rate the federal funds rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm variable interest rates at our current level of borrowing a one percentage point increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 30 million our remaining debt is fixedrate debt and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense periodically we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates however at december 31 2011 we had no such derivative financial instruments in place 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2011 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

operating segments 

 

segment information is also included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

jbi segment 

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 forming a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps the origin and destination pickup and delivery services “drayage” are handled by our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads while utilizing third party dray carriers where economical by performing our own dray services we are able to provide a cost competitive seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers 

 

  

  

jbi operates 45666 pieces of companycontrolled trailing equipment systemwide the fleet is primarily comprised of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality jbi also manages a fleet of 2592 companyowned tractors and 3198 company drivers that maintain our high service standards at december 31 2010 the total jbi employee count was 3533 revenue for the jbi segment in 2010 was 214 billion 

dcs segment 

dcs specializes in the design development and execution of supply chain solutions which support a variety of transportation networks our designs are developed and customized to provide assigned equipment and labor industryleading service levels optimum efficiency and costsavings management dcs focuses on final mile delivery replenishment and specialized services supporting private fleet conversion dedicated fleet creation and transportation system augmentation we have continued to expand our specialized service offerings in the final mile delivery services with approximately 90 cross dock locations to date our operations are managed on site by transportation professionals who work in concert daily with customers and delivery specialists to ensure safe and costeffective delivery operations are governed by longerterm contracts that typically include fixed cost components and fuel surcharge programs on roundtrip miles 

at december 31 2010 this segment operated 4259 companyowned trucks 357 customerowned trucks and 23 independent contractor trucks the dcs segment employed 6355 people at december 31 2010 dcs revenue for 2010 was 907 million 

jbt segment 

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers 

at december 31 2010 the jbt segment operated 1697 companyowned tractors and employed 2217 people 1865 of whom were drivers at december 31 2010 we had 891 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment some of whom were leasing companyowned tractors jbt revenue for 2010 was 479 million 

ics segment 

ics provides nonasset assetlight and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with our owned equipment by leveraging the jb hunt brand systems and network we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides singlesource logistics management for customers that desire to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supply chain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates outside offices as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers 

at december 31 2010 the ics segment employed 329 people with a carrier base of approximately 25600 ics revenue for 2010 was 291 million 

marketing and operations 

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise specialty consumer items appliances forest and paper products food and beverages building materials soaps and cosmetics automotive parts electronics and chemicals our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of fortune 500 companies our ability to offer multiple services utilizing our four business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties represents a competitive advantage we provide a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers and those that desire a provider of complementary services as a way to meet all of their supply chain needs 

 

  

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

people 

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2010 we had 15223 employees which consisted of 10172 company drivers 3821 office personnel and 1230 mechanics we also had arrangements with approximately 1000 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

revenue equipment 

our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment 

as of december 31 2010 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 8548 units in addition we had approximately 1000 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe that operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2010 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 29 years our containers averaged 47 years of age and our trailers averaged 87 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

effective with modelyear 2010 engines the epa has mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractors the 2010 epacompliant engines are expected to have no decrease in miles per gallon and a slight increase in operating costs due to more stringent maintenance procedures compared to prior engine standards due to exhaust gas recirculation egr technology which achieves lower emissions 

competition and the industry 

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies as well as other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service considering the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment competition ranges from large diversified carriers to local transportation and delivery service providers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers 

 

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service revenue equipment quality and availability of carriers for logistics services 

 

  

  

 

regulation 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are subject to regulation by those countries 

in december 2010 the fmcsa began reporting to the public through its web site specific safety rating and carrier ranking statistics for more than 500000 transportation companies in connection with its compliance safety accountability 2010 csa 2010 program the csa 2010 reporting process tracks and reports data on specific carriers including moving violations outofservice events and ontheroad inspections csa 2010 also accumulates information on commercial drivers however individual driver information is only available to carriers and others that subscribe to a reporting service our current csa 2010 scores meet or exceed the fmcsa’s requirements for acceptable performance as this csa 2010 carrier and driver information becomes more readily available to shippers consignees brokers carriers and other parties it is expected that certain carriers and drivers will exit the transportation industry 

in december 2010 the fmcsa also issued proposed changes to the hours of service rules for commercial vehicle drivers subsequent to a 60day comment period the fmcsa is expected to publish a final rule in july 2011 with an effective date several months later we believe we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 

in january 2011 the fmcsa issued a regulatory proposal regarding the required use of electronic onboard recorders eobr in an effort to facilitate the reporting and enforcement of driver inservice hours if these types of rules are eventually implemented certain transportation companies may be required to utilize eobr’s 

we are in the process of evaluating all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations and will continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

our business is subject to general economic and business factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures 

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the trucking industry license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment surpluses in the market for used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

 

  

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our ics business segment utilizes thirdparty carriers these thirdparties are subject to similar regulation requirements noted previously which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry aside from periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering the loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2010 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have renewed our policies for 2011 with substantially the same terms as our 2010 policies for personal injury cargo and property damage we have reduced the selfinsured portion of our workers’ compensation claims exposure and are fully insured for substantially all claims incurred in 2011 we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2010 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 34 of our revenue our jbi jbt and ics segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

 

  

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

significant changes in hoursofservice regulations and other motor carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping equipment effective january 2010 a set of more stringent emissions standards became effective for modelyear 2010 manufactured tractor engines further csa 2010 could have a material adverse effect on the ability to obtain qualified drivers we continue to monitor the impact of new and proposed standards on acquisition and operating costs 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers delivery personnel and thirdparty carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

we compete with many other transportation services providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability

we are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries vehicular collisions accidents and cargo damage we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment certain insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim we have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured for periods prior to january 1 2010 certain policies include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period inception this contractual premium adjustment factor is used to convert the selfinsured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims for periods beginning january 1 2010 our personal injury and property damage policies no longer include these premium adjustment factors and the claim liability remains with us for the life of the claim 

 

  

  

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on measurement dates policy expiration dates and claim type during 2008 and 2009 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million for workers’ compensation for 2010 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for substantially all workers’ compensation claims we have renewed our policies for 2011 with substantially the same terms as our 2010 policies for personal injury property damage and workers’ compensation 

 

  our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2010 we had an accrual of approximately 33 million for estimated net claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2010 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 38 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums 

revenue equipment 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment that is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairment to our assets at december 31 2010 

we have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our suppliers were unable to perform under the terms of our agreements for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for the selection of thirdparty transportation providers 

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers which have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

 

  

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with current accounting standards our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

year in review 

 

significant events for calendar year 2010 include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our 2010 net earnings of 1996 million or 156 per diluted share were up 46 from the 1364 million or 105 per diluted share earned in 2009 the increase in earnings was due to higher load count and increased activity within our jbi and dcs segments compared with 2009 our jbt and ics segments realized higher operating revenues over 2009 despite fewer tractors in jbt and lower load volume in ics utilization of equipment and pricing improved in all segments and the cost reduction practices put in place in 2009 continued to provide benefit throughout 2010 our response to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital enabled us to take advantage of load volume recovery in 2010 

our 2010 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 908 compared with 923 in 2009 our 2009 operating income reflected 103 million of pretax charges to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 

 

  

  

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

 

 

  

2010 compared with 2009 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues were 38 billion in 2010 an 184 increase over 2009 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 516 million in 2010 compared with 326 million in 2009 which impacts the yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2010 revenue increased 14 over 2009 revenue in all operating segments increased over 2009 with consolidated load growth and rate improvements contributing to the increase in revenues 

consolidated operating expenses 

our 2010 consolidated operating expenses increased 166 from 2009 the impact of this increase and the 184 increase in 2010 revenue from 2009 resulted in an improvement in our operating ratio to 908 from 923 in 2009 rents and purchased transportation costs increased 224 in 2010 as a result of higher load volume which increased services from these thirdparty rail and truck carriers in addition the higher price of fuel contributed to the increase in rents and purchased transportation costs since fuel costs of thirdparty rail and truck carriers are included in purchased transportation expense the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 141 in 2010 from 2009 this increase was related to increases in driver and other labor pay due to increased business demand and the increase in final mile delivery service business compared with a year ago in addition we were able to reactivate and increase certain compensation and benefit programs for all of our employees in 2010 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 257 in 2010 primarily due to a 23 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs eg 005 per gallon to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

 

  

  

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 42 in 2010 primarily due to additions to our jbi and dcs segments for power and trailing equipment in support of additional business demand insurance and claims expense decreased 50 for 2010 due to fewer cargo claim incidents and a lower cost per claim for casualty the 219 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the pretax writedown of 103 million recorded in 2009 related to assets held for sale this decrease was offset by increases in a charitable contribution and building rental expense in addition 2010 included a gain on asset sales of 4 million compared with losses on asset sales of 04 million in 2009 

net interest expense for 2010 increased by 21 compared with 2009 this increase was primarily due to increased outstanding debt balances offset slightly by reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt 

the “equity in operations of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of transplace inc tpi the change from 2009 is due to the sale of our interests in 2009 see note 12 affiliated company in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions 

our effective income tax rate was 376 in 2010 and 391 in 2009 the decrease in 2010 was primarily related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the impact in 2009 of the sale of our interests in tpi we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 385 for calendar year 2011 

segments 

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2010 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

 

  

 

  

 

  

  

  

 

  

 

 

  

  

  

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue increased 214 to 214 billion in 2010 from 176 billion in 2009 a significant portion of this increase in revenue related to the 174 increase in load volume and improvement in revenue per load compared with 2009 

operating income in our jbi segment increased to 237 million in 2010 from 183 million in 2009 increased equipment utilization and higher revenues resulted in the operating income increase over 2009 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue increased 198 to 907 million in 2010 from 757 million in 2009 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in productivity and truck counts primarily related to growth in delivery and replenishment business this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the capacity business 

operating income increased to 83 million in 2010 compared with 63 million in 2009 this increase in operating income was due to the increased revenue and the improved leverage gained from those higher revenues 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue increased 73 to 479 million in 2010 from 447 million in 2009 this increase in revenue was primarily the result of increases in rates and longer lengths of haul compared with 2009 

our jbt segment had operating income of 19 million in 2010 compared with an operating loss of 11 million in 2009 this was mainly a result of increased rates and the impact of our network refinement and tractor fleet count reduction which allowed for effective cost control measures 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 123 to 291 million in 2010 from 259 million in 2009 this increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in load volume and higher pricing in both contractual and transactional business 

operating income decreased 292 to 9 million in 2010 compared with 13 million in 2009 the decrease primarily relates to higher transportation costs and fuel prices as well as new branch location costs 

2009 compared with 2008 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues were 32 billion in 2009 a 142 decrease from 2008 significantly lower fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of 326 million in 2009 compared with 730 million in 2008 this change in fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2009 revenue decreased 4 from 2008 while load volume increased 93 and 690 in 2009 for jbi and ics respectively we experienced a decrease in revenue in all segments except ics the decreases in our jbi dcs and jbt segments were primarily a result of competitive rates as well as decreased activity for certain customers due to the overall economic recession in addition jbt segment revenue decreased as a result of reduced tractor utilization and our continued effort to reduce the size of the jbt segment to an appropriate level for our service offerings 

 

  

  

consolidated operating expenses 

our 2009 consolidated operating expenses decreased 124 from 2008 the impact of this decrease and the 142 decrease in 2009 revenue from 2008 resulted in an increase in our operating ratio to 923 from 904 in 2008 rents and purchased transportation costs decreased 55 in 2009 primarily due to lower payments made to railroads and drayage companies this decrease was partially offset by an increase related to thirdparty carriers servicing ics due to growth in that segment the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits decreased 71 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in total driver pay this reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a 33 decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment 

 

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 475 in 2009 primarily due to a 367 lower fuel cost per gallon and slightly higher fuel miles per gallon 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 65 which was primarily the result of the reduction of our tractor fleet related to the rightsizing of the jbt segment this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the container and chassis depreciation due to volume growth in the jbi segment operating supplies and expenses decreased 40 primarily due to decreased costs of driver expenses and toll expenses insurance and claims expense decreased 164 for 2009 due to fewer accidents and lower claims costs the 146 increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the 2009 charges to write down to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale compared with the 2008 writedown during 2009 and 2008 these pretax writedown charges were 103 million and 39 million respectively in addition 2009 included losses on asset sales of 04 million compared with gains on asset sales of 12 million in 2008 

net interest expense for 2009 decreased by 206 compared with 2008 this decrease was primarily due to reduced outstanding debt balances and reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt the decrease was partially offset by the effect of a refund in 2008 related to a priorperiod tax settlement 

the “equity in operations of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of transplace inc tpi prior to december 2009 we owned a 37 equity interest in this global transportation and logistics company the increase in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to certain transactions in the fourth quarter of 2009 which were treated as a sale of all interests in this logistics company these transactions resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 33 million during 2009 see note 12 affiliated company in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions 

our effective income tax rate was 391 in 2009 and 378 in 2008 the increase in 2009 was partly related to the transactions with tpi which resulted in a valuation allowance on the deferred tax benefits related to the sale 

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue decreased 96 to 176 billion in 2009 from 195 billion in 2008 a significant portion of this decline in revenue related to decreased fuel surcharge revenue due to reduced fuel costs excluding fuel surcharge revenue jbi segment revenue increased 1 in 2009 from 2008 although load counts increased 93 revenue per load decreased 173 and average length of haul decreased 26 

operating income in our jbi segment declined to 183 million in 2009 from 254 million in 2008 declining rates and a pretax charge to write down the value of certain equipment held for sale contributed to our operating income decreasing by 278 in 2009 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue declined 183 to 757 million in 2009 from 927 million in 2008 excluding fuel surcharge revenue dcs segment revenue decreased 9 in 2009 from 2008 this decrease in revenue was primarily due to a 63 decrease in average truck count and lower load counts as we worked with our customers to reach the optimum fleet size for their businesses 

operating income decreased to 63 million in 2009 compared with 92 million in 2008 this decrease in operating income was due to decreased revenue higher implementation expenses for new and expanded contracts increased operating costs for facilities and a pretax charge to write down the value of certain equipment held for sale 

 

  

  

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue declined 340 to 447 million in 2009 from 676 million in 2008 the decrease in revenue was the result of a 199 decrease in load count due to much softer demand in 2009 than in 2008 as well as significant decreases in rates 

our jbt segment had an operating loss of 11 million in 2009 compared to operating income of 14 million in 2008 mainly a result of reduced rates and a reduction in revenue due to lower tractor count and utilization this decrease in operating income was partially offset by costcontrolling measures implemented to reduce hiring costs and other operating costs 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 238 to 259 million in 2009 from 209 million in 2008 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 69 increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 

operating income increased 226 to 13 million in 2009 compared with 11 million in 2008 the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment in 2009 we continued to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover related increases in operating expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

net cash provided by operating activities was 428 million in 2010 357 million in 2009 and 505 million in 2008 the increase in 2010 cash provided by operating activities relative to 2009 after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation sharebased compensation and impairment charges was primarily due to increased earnings in 2010 over 2009 in addition the timing of cash activity related to insurance claims and payroll accruals increased cash provided from operations these increases were partially offset by a decrease related to the timing of collections from customers and the payments to vendors 

cash flows used in investing activities primarily relates to additions to our revenue equipment fleet net of proceeds from disposals the lower level of cash used in investing activities during 2010 was the result of decreases in tractor and trailer purchases in our jbt segment this decrease was partially offset by an increase in container and chassis purchases in our jbi segment as well as additional investments in specialized revenue equipment for new dcs customers the decrease in proceeds received from equipment sales reflects the smaller quantity of revenue equipment sold or traded in 2010 compared with 2009 

net cash used in financing activities during 2010 increased from 2009 primarily due to our stock repurchases repayments on our revolving lines of credit and an increase in dividends paid in 2010 the increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the proceeds received from our public debt offering in september 2010 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition earnings capital requirements and other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 010 per share quarterly dividend in 2008 an 011 per share quarterly dividend in 2009 and a 012 per share quarterly dividend in 2010 on february 3 2011 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 012 to 013 which was paid on february 25 2011 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

  

  

 

liquidity 

our need for capital has typically related to the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new latemodel equipment we are able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we obtained capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized leases to acquire revenue equipment 

at december 31 2010 we were authorized to borrow up to 350 million under a revolving line of credit which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in march 2012 the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating at december 31 2010 we had 5 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 335 under this agreement 

our senior notes consist of three separate issuances the first is 200 million of 531 senior notes which mature in march 2011 interest payments are due semiannually in march and september of each year the second is 200 million of 608 senior notes which mature in july 2014 for this second issuance principal payments in the amount of 500 million are due in july 2012 and 2013 with the remainder due upon maturity interest payments are due semiannually in january and july of each year the third is 250 million of 3375 senior notes which mature in september 2015 interest payments are due semiannually in march and september of each year beginning march 2011 we may redeem for cash some or all of the 3375 notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture 

our financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2010 

we believe that our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future our working capital ratio decreased from 2009 primarily as a result of reclassifying our 200 million 2011 senior note to current liabilities based on a maturity date of march 2011 we anticipate refinancing all or a portion of this note upon maturity our debt to equity ratio increased from 2009 due to an increase in debt related to the current year issuance and a reduction in equity due to the share repurchase program 

we are currently committed to spend approximately 406 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2011 which is primarily related to tractors and containers and chassis 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 161 million of obligations primarily related to facilities leases 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our expected obligations and commitments in millions as of december 31 2010 

 

 

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2010 

 

  

  

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 107 million at december 31 2010 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2011 which are related to certain operating agreements and our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 202 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates on variablerate debt outstanding of our total 6542 million of debt we had 50 million of variablerate debt outstanding at december 31 2010 under our revolving lines of credit the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm interest rates related to this variablerate debt outstanding our remaining debt is fixedrate debt and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense periodically we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates however at december 31 2010 we had no such derivative financial instruments in place 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2010 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2010 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

our mission and strategy 

 

we forge longterm partnerships with key customers that include supplychain management as an integral part of their strategy working in concert we drive out cost add value and function as an extension of our customers’ enterprise we believe that our operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits and returns to stockholders 

recent focus 

 

our recent focus has been to maximize the return on our invested capital and generate free cash flow to reduce outstanding debt we believe we can leverage the services of our business units for the ultimate benefit of our customers we continuously analyze where capital investments yield the best return and allocate funds to those business units and specific activities inside the business unit unacceptable returns in various areas have caused us to reduce certain business models or exit those activities within the business model our goal is to become more assetlight in certain of the services we provide but to continue to grow with new and existing customers by providing the most efficient transportation solutions to their supply chains we are encouraged by the growing number of shippers using all of our services as a way to meet their needs and feel it is positive confirmation of our focus and goals 

  examples of steps taken to reach those goals include the continued contraction of the jbt business unit coupled with the growth in our ics business unit the expansion of our eastern intermodal network and the development of our new and existing customer base we also continue to direct our dedicated business unit toward providing bestinclass service in applications that require unique and specialized services ranging from retail and smallbusiness replenishment to deliveries at personal residences a significant step toward this goal has been the implementation of a crossdock and delivery system network during 2009 by midyear 2010 we plan to manage delivery facilities or operations that will allow us to directly serve in excess of 90 of the us population 

  increasingly our customers are seeking energyefficient transportation solutions to reduce both cost and greenhousegas emissions our intermodal service addresses both demands we are customizing dedicated solutions aimed at minimizing transportationrelated carbon emissions efforts to improve fleet fuel efficiency are ongoing and we are an environmental protection agency epa smartway sm transport partner

operating segments 

 

segment information is also included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

jbi segment 

  the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership with what is now the bnsf railway company a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment jbi draws on the intermodal services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries “drayage” for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations we provide the drayage service at either the origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads but utilize third parties where economical performing our own dray services keeps costs lower and improves customer service jbi provides seamless coordination of the rail and dray movements for our customers and delivers a single billing for complete doortodoor service

dcs segment 

  dcs offers transportation services that generally are not provided by common truckload carriers or intermodal due to strict service requirements specialized equipment and intense driver and delivery personnel demands our operations are managed on site by transportation professionals who work in concert daily with the customer and our drivers to ensure that we deliver their product or service on time in a safe and costeffective manner all operations are governed by longerterm contracts that typically include fixed cost components related to dedicated specialized equipment and fuel surcharge programs on roundtrip miles during 2009 we commenced the implementation of significantly more new business than we have in any other prior year as a result of this growth our finalmile delivery channel business became a significant part of our dcs business 

at december 31 2009 this segment operated 3969 companycontrolled trucks 358 customerowned trucks and 31 independent contractor trucks the dcs segment employed 5765 people at december 31 2009 dcs revenue for 2009 was 757 million

  we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle in addition ics utilizes its own proactive local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided

  we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2009 we had 14171 employees including 9287 company drivers 1210 mechanics and 3674 office personnel we also had arrangements with approximately 1200 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

revenue equipment 

  our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment 

as of december 31 2009 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 7970 units in addition we had approximately 1200 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe that operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2009 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 27 years our containers averaged 54 years of age and our trailers averaged 79 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

  effective with modelyear 2010 engines the epa has mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractors the 2010 epacompliant engines are expected to have a slight increase in miles per gallon and an increase in operating costs compared with current engine standards due to selective catalytic reduction scr technology which achieves lower emissions at this time we have not taken delivery of any epa 2010 model engines but plan on doing so later in 2010 

competition and the industry 

the freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies as well as other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service considering the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment competition ranges from large diversified carriers to local transportation and delivery service carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price ontime pickup and delivery service revenue equipment quality and availability of carriers for logistics services 

regulation 

 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries 

 

in november 2008 the fmcsa adopted final provisions of the agency’s december 17 2007 interim final rule concerning hours of service for commercial vehicle drivers this final rule allows drivers to continue to drive up to 11 hours within a 14hour nonextendable window from the start of the workday following at least 10 consecutive hours off duty the rule also allows motor carriers and drivers to continue to restart calculations of weekly onduty limits after the driver has at least 34 consecutive hours off duty the rule was effective january 19 2009 we believe we are in compliance with all applicable regulations and continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

our business is subject to general economic and business factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures 

  our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the trucking industry license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment surpluses in the market for used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers independent contractors and thirdparty carriers 

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  our ics business segment utilizes thirdparty carriers aside from periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain loads we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering the loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  fuel costs can be very volatile we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2009 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

 

  our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings during 2007 the selfinsured portion of our claims exposure for all claims was 500000 per occurrence during 2008 and 2009 the selfinsured portion of our claims was 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have renewed our policies for 2010 with substantially the same terms as our 2009 policies for personal injury and property damage we have reduced the selfinsured portion of our workers’ compensation claims exposure and are substantially fully insured for claims in 2010 we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  for the calendar year ended december 31 2009 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 33 of our revenue our jbi jbt and ics segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

significant changes in hoursofservice regulations and other motor carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping equipment 

  in january 2010 a set of more stringent emissions standards became effective for modelyear 2010 manufactured tractor engines while it is too early to assess the impact of the new standards our fuel costs operating costs and acquisition costs could be impacted 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers delivery personnel and thirdparty carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary number of employees or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our ics segment growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services 

we operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

we compete with many other transportation services providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins 

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in the cost of our operations such as towing and other maintenance activities frequently occur during the winter months natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs

 item 2 properties 

  our corporate headquarters are in lowell arkansas we occupy a number of buildings in lowell that we utilize for administrative support customer service freight dispatch and data processing and warehousing we maintain a backup data center for disaster recovery maintenance shop and driver operations facility in lowell we also own or lease approximately 30 other significant facilities across the united states where we perform maintenance on our equipment provide bulk fuel and employ personnel to support operations these facilities vary from one to 35 acres in size each of our business segments utilizes our larger facilities for services including bulk fueling maintenance and driver support activities in addition as of december 31 2009 we have leased approximately 80 facilities in connection with the development of our crossdock and delivery system network implemented in 2009 excluded from the table that follows are leases for a number of small offices and parking yards throughout the country that support our customers’ business needs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

 

we are a defendant in certain classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former californiabased drivers who allege claims for unpaid wages failure to provide meal and rest periods and other items further proceedings have been stayed in these matters pending the california supreme court’s decision in a case unrelated to ours involving similar issues we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss if any that may arise from these lawsuits 

 

  we are involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business based on present knowledge of the facts and in certain cases opinions of outside counsel we believe the resolution of claims and pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 2009

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions accidents and cargo claims most of our insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured excluding new policies entered into and applicable to claims incurred in 2010 our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period inception this contractual premium adjustment factor is used to convert the selfinsured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims our estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes these premium adjustment factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occur 

  the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates during 2007 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury property damage and workers’ compensation for 2008 and 2009 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million for workers’ compensation we have renewed our policies for 2010 with substantially the same terms as our 2009 policies for personal injury and property damage we have reduced the selfinsured portion of our workers’ compensation claims exposure and are substantially fully insured for claims in 2010 

  our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2009 we had an accrual of approximately 19 million for estimated net claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2009 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 32 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums we are also substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

revenue equipment 

we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under operating lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment that is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment we have not identified any impairment to our remaining assets at december 31 2009 

  we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

 

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for carrier selection with respect to our ics business 

 

our trade accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers which have been reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the assetandliability method in accordance with current accounting standards our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

year in review 

 

significant events for calendar year 2009 include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our 2009 net earnings of 1364 million or 105 per diluted share were down 32 from the 2006 million or 156 per diluted share earned in 2008 pricing pressure and resulting margin contraction aggravated by the ongoing recession contributed significantly to the decline in earnings for the current year while we made strides in controlling and reducing operating expenses in light of the economic conditions the pricing pressure experienced by each of our operating segments was our largest challenge in 2009 

freight demand during 2009 was up for our jbi and ics segments compared with 2008 while demand for dcs and jbt was softer particularly during the first half of 2009 although loads were up for jbi operating income decreased 28 which was primarily the result of rate decreases from an extremely competitive bid season and due to charges to write down the value of equipment held for sale dcs showed a decline in operating income of 32 which was due to lower business demand levels increased implementation costs for onboarding new business and charges to write down the value of equipment held for sale jbt reported an operating loss due primarily to decreased rates which was partly offset by costcontrol measures implemented in 2009 our ics segment grew operating income by 23 primarily due to revenue and volume growth 

in response to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital we increased our jbi tractor and container counts by 5 and 3 respectively as well as increased our dcs trailer count by 7 we reduced our jbt companyowned tractor fleet by 35 excluding tractors designated as held for sale we were able to effect some of these changes by transferring revenue equipment among our fleets 

  

  our 2009 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 923 compared with 904 in 2008 our 2009 operating income reflected 103 million of pretax charges to write down the value of certain assets held for sale operating income in 2008 reflected 39 million of pretax charges related to assets held for sale 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

 

 

 

2009 compared with 2008 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues were 32 billion in 2009 a 142 decrease from 2008 significantly lower fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 326 million in 2009 compared with 730 million in 2008 this change in fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2009 revenue decreased 4 from 2008 while load volume increased 93 and 690 in 2009 for jbi and ics respectively we experienced a decrease in revenue in all segments except ics the decreases in our jbi dcs and jbt segments were primarily a result of competitive rates as well as decreased activity for certain customers due to the overall economic recession in addition jbt segment revenue decreased as a result of reduced tractor utilization and our continued effort to reduce the size of the jbt segment to an appropriate level for our service offerings 

consolidated operating expenses 

  our 2009 consolidated operating expenses decreased 124 from 2008 the impact of this decrease and the 142 decrease in 2009 revenue from 2008 resulted in an increase in our operating ratio to 923 from 904 in 2008 rents and purchased transportation costs decreased 55 in 2009 primarily due to lower payments made to railroads and drayage companies this decrease was partially offset by an increase related to thirdparty carriers servicing ics due to growth in that segment the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits decreased 71 in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in total driver pay this reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a 33 decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment  

fuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 475 in 2009 primarily due to a 367 lower fuel cost per gallon and slightly higher fuel miles per gallon we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs eg 005 per gallon to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues due to these programs this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 65 which was primarily the result of the reduction of our tractor fleet related to the rightsizing of the jbt segment this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the container and chassis depreciation due to volume growth in the jbi segment operating supplies and expenses decreased 40 primarily due to decreased costs of driver expenses and toll expenses insurance and claims expense decreased 164 for 2009 due to fewer accidents and lower claims costs the 146 increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the 2009 charges to write down to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale compared with the 2008 writedown during 2009 and 2008 these pretax writedown charges were 103 million and 39 million respectively in addition 2009 included losses on asset sales of 04 million compared with gains on asset sales of 12 million in 2008 

net interest expense for 2009 decreased by 206 compared with 2008 this decrease was primarily due to reduced outstanding debt balances and reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt the decrease was partially offset by the effect of a refund in 2008 related to a priorperiod tax settlement 

the “equity in operations of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of transplace inc tpi we owned a 37 equity interest in this global transportation and logistics company the increase in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to certain transactions in the fourth quarter of 2009 which were treated as a sale of all interests in this logistics company these transactions resulted in a pretax gain of approximately 33 million during 2009 see note 12 affiliated company in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions 

our effective income tax rate was 391 in 2009 and 378 in 2008 the increase in 2009 was partly related to the previously mentioned transactions with tpi these transactions resulted in a valuation allowance on the deferred tax benefits on our balance sheet we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 385 for calendar year 2010 

segments 

 

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2009 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

operating revenue by segment 

 

operating income loss by segment 

 

 

operating data by segment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

jbi segment 

  jbi segment revenue decreased 96 to 176 billion in 2009 from 195 billion in 2008 a significant portion of this decline in revenue related to decreased fuel surcharge revenue due to reduced fuel costs excluding fuel surcharge revenue jbi segment revenue increased 1 in 2009 from 2008 although load counts increased 93 revenue per load decreased 173 and average length of haul decreased 26 

operating income in our jbi segment declined to 183 million in 2009 from 254 million in 2008 declining rates and a pretax charge to write down the value of certain equipment held for sale contributed to our operating income decreasing by 278 in 2009 

dcs segment 

 

  dcs segment revenue declined 183 to 757 million in 2009 from 927 million in 2008 excluding fuel surcharge revenue dcs segment revenue decreased 9 in 2009 from 2008 this decrease in revenue was primarily due to a 63 decrease in average truck count and lower load counts as we worked with our customers to reach the optimum fleet size for their businesses 

  operating income decreased to 63 million in 2009 compared with 92 million in 2008 this decrease in operating income was due to decreased revenue higher implementation expenses for new and expanded contracts increased operating costs for facilities and a pretax charge to write down the value of certain equipment held for sale 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue declined 340 to 447 million in 2009 from 676 million in 2008 the decrease in revenue was the result of a 199 decrease in load count due to much softer demand in 2009 than in 2008 as well as significant decreases in rates 

  our jbt segment had an operating loss of 11 million in 2009 compared to operating income of 14 million in 2008 mainly a result of reduced rates and a reduction in revenue due to lower tractor count and utilization this decrease in operating income was partially offset by costcontrolling measures implemented to reduce hiring costs and other operating costs 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 238 to 259 million in 2009 from 209 million in 2008 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 69 increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 

  operating income increased 226 to 13 million in 2009 compared with 11 million in 2008 the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment in 2009 we continued to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover related increases in operating expenses 

2008 compared with 2007 

consolidated operating revenues 

  

  our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 37 billion in 2008 a 69 increase over 2007 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 730 million in 2008 compared with 480 million in 2007 if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2008 revenue decreased less than 1 from 2007 a 135 and 1173 increase in 2008 jbi and ics load volume respectively contributed to our higher levels of revenue the increases in revenue of our jbi and ics segments were partially offset by decreases in our dcs segment as a result of decreased activity for delivery service accounts due to the overall economic slowdown and weak housing market our jbt segment revenue decreased as a result of rate declines and reduced tractor utilization due to decreasing freight demand

  our total 2008 consolidated operating expenses increased 81 over 2007 and offset the impact of the 69 increase in 2008 revenue over 2007 that resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to 904 from 894 in 2007 rents and purchased transportation costs rose 197 in 2008 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads drayage companies and thirdparty carriers servicing ics the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits decreased 33 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to decreases in total driver pay this reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a 24 decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment  

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 123 in 2008 primarily due to 297 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 

the 14 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to fewer tractors owned in our jbt and dcs segments operating supplies and expenses rose 15 in 2008 primarily as a result of increased costs in airfare and travel expenses insurance and claims expense decreased 128 due to fewer accidents and lower claims costs the 142 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in other driving expenses as a result of a decrease in the number of drivers and a decrease in the charge to write down to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale compared with the 2007 writedown in addition gains on asset sales were 12 million in 2008 compared with losses on asset sales of 04 million in 2007 

net interest expense for 2008 decreased by 189 compared with 2007 this decrease was due to reduced outstanding debt balances as well as reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt interest expense was further reduced by a refund of interest previously paid to the internal revenue service irs from the 1999 tax case settlement and lower accrued interest on uncertain tax positions 

our effective income tax rate was 378 in 2008 and 344 in 2007 the increase in 2008 was primarily due to the 2007 rate being reduced by our 1999 tax case settlement in 2007 

jbi segment 

  jbi segment revenue grew by 181 to 195 billion in 2008 from 165 billion in 2007 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 135 increase in load volume the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily the result of a 41 increase in revenue per load including fuel surcharges partially offset by a 43 decrease in the average length of haul 

  operating income in our jbi segment rose to 254 million in 2008 from 239 million in 2007 while increased volumes contributed to higher operating margins we were able to increase our driver productivity and significantly reduce our reliance on thirdparty equipment and drayage all of these factors contributed to our operating income increasing by 63 in 2008 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue declined 10 to 927 million in 2008 from 937 million in 2007 this decrease in revenue was primarily due to an 88 decrease in average length of haul and lower load counts as we worked with our customers to reach the optimum fleet size for their businesses 

  

  operating income decreased to 92 million in 2008 compared with 94 million in 2007 this decrease in operating income was due to decreased revenue and higher fuel and operating costs these higher operating expenses relative to 2007 were offset by decreases in equipment rental costs and lower insurance and claim costs 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue declined 196 to 676 million in 2008 from 842 million in 2007 the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a 209 decrease in load count due to much softer demand in 2008 than in 2007 

operating income in our jbt segment declined to 14 million in 2008 from 32 million in 2007 mainly due to reduced revenue and higher fuel costs 

ics segment 

ics segment revenue grew 1285 to 209 million in 2008 from 92 million in 2007 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 1173 increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 

  

  operating income increased nearly 146 to 11 million in 2008 compared with 4 million in 2007 the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment in 2008 we continued to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover higher operating expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

  

  net cash provided by operating activities was 357 million in 2009 505 million in 2008 and 458 million in 2007 the decrease in 2009 cash provided by operating activities relative to 2008 after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation sharebased compensation and impairment charges was due primarily to decreased earnings and the timing of cash activity related to trade accounts receivable and tax payments 

cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflected additions to net of disposals from our fleet of revenue equipment the higher level of cash used in investing activities during 2009 partly reflected our strategy to increase containers and chassis in our jbi segment as well as additional investments in specialized revenue equipment for new dcs customers 

  

  net cash used in financing activities during 2009 decreased from 2008 primarily due to larger repayments on our revolving lines of credit in 2008 this decrease was partially offset by increases in dividends paid in 2009 as a result of the increase to 011 per share quarterly cash dividend from 010 per share in 2008 

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition earnings capital requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 009 per share quarterly dividend in 2007 a 010 per share quarterly dividend in 2008 and an 011 per share quarterly dividend in 2009 on february 4 2010 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 011 to 012 which was paid on february 26 2010 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

liquidity 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new latemodel equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have during the past few years obtained capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 

at december 31 2009 we were authorized to borrow up to 350 million under a revolving line of credit which expires march 29 2012 the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating at december 31 2009 we had 1650 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 074 under this agreement 

effective june 29 2009 we terminated a 75 million accounts receivable securitization facility concurrent with this termination we dissolved a wholly owned subsidiary jbh receivables llc which was formed in july 2006 as a bankruptcy remote entity associated with the accounts receivable securitization facility 

in march 2007 we sold 200 million of 531 senior notes 2011 notes which mature march 29 2011 to various purchasers through a privateplacement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated march 15 2007 the proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases and for general working capital purposes the 2011 notes were issued at par value interest payments are due semiannually in march and september of each year 

in july 2007 we sold 200 million of 608 senior notes 2014 notes which mature july 26 2014 to various purchasers through a privateplacement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated july 15 2007 proceeds from these notes were used to purchase shares of our common stock pay down existing debt on our revolvingcredit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment principal payments in the amount of 500 million are due july 26 2012 and july 26 2013 with the remainder due upon maturity interest payments are due semiannually in january and july of each year 

our 100 million term loan facility which was arranged in connection with our purchase of used dryvan trailers matured september 29 2009 the balance due at maturity of 615 million was paid during september 2009 reducing the balance to zero concurrent with the loan and credit agreement we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that expired when the related term loan matured 

our revolving lines of credit and other debt facilities require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2009 

we believe that our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future the increase in our working capital ratio from 2008 was primarily driven by our decrease in current debt outstanding as a result of payments on the term loan in 2009 

we are currently committed to spend approximately 132 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2010 which is primarily related to tractors and containers 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to operating leases primarily for facilities as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 156 million of obligations on the facilities leases 

 

1 interest payments on debt are based on the debt balance and applicable rate at december 31 2009 

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 105 million at december 31 2009 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2010 which are related to 1 our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims and 2 our operating lease agreements we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 219 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a codification of fasb accounting standards and the hierarchy of gaap which establishes the codification as the single source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb sec rules and interpretive releases are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants the codification became effective for us beginning july 1 2009 the codification is not intended to change or alter existing gaap and accordingly it did not impact our results of operations cash flows or financial position we have adjusted historical gaap references in this annual report to reflect authoritative guidance included in the codification 

in may 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to subsequent events which became effective for us during the second quarter of 2009 this guidance sets forth the circumstances and the period after the balance sheet date for which an entity should evaluate events for recognition or disclosure in its financial statements in addition the guidance identifies the disclosures that an entity should make about such events we have evaluated subsequent events from december 31 2009 through february 26 2010 when the financial statements were issued in accordance with this guidance adoption did not have an effect on our financial results 

we adopted the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities effective january 1 2009 adoption of this guidance increased our disclosures regarding fair value instruments but did not have an effect on our operating income or net earnings see note 7 fair value measurements for more description 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

of our total 5650 million of debt we had 1650 million of variable rate debt outstanding at december 31 2009 under our revolving lines of credit the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm interest rates risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates at our current level of borrowing a 1 increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately 17 million our remaining debt is fixed rate debt and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense periodically we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates however at december 31 2009 we had no such derivative financial instruments in place 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2009 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2009 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

recent focus 

  

our recent focus has been to maximize the return on our invested capital and to generate free cash flow to reduce outstanding debt we continuously analyze where capital expenditures yield the best return and allocate funds to those business units and specific activities inside the business unit unacceptable returns in various areas have caused us to reduce certain of these business models or exit those activities within the business model our goal is to become more assetlight in the services we provide but to continue to grow with new and existing customers by providing the most efficient transportation solutions to their supply chains examples of steps taken to reach those goals include the continued contraction of the jbt business unit coupled with the growth in our ics business unit the expansion of our eastern intermodal network the repayment of approximately 280 million in outstanding debt in 2008 and the expansion of our new customer base we also continue to direct our dedicated business unit toward providing bestinclass service in applications that require unique and specialized services ranging from retail and smallbusiness replenishment to deliveries at personal residences 

  

increasingly our customers are seeking energyefficient transportation solutions to reduce both cost and greenhousegas emissions our intermodal service addresses both demands we are customizing dedicated solutions aimed at minimizing transportationrelated carbon emissions efforts to improve fleet fuel efficiency are ongoing and we are an environmental protection agency epa smartway sm transport partner

  

as always we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all of our operations as safely as possible 

  

operating segments 

  

segment information is also included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

jbi segment 

  

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership with the former santa fe railway now the bnsf railway company a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment essentially jbi draws on the intermodal also known as “container on flatcar” services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries “drayage” for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations we provide the drayage service at either the origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our companyowned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads but utilize third parties where economical performing our own dray 

  

  

services keeps costs lower and improves customer service jbi provides seamless coordination of the rail and dray movements for our customers and delivers a single billing for the complete doortodoor service 

  

our intermodal program has grown to more than 837000 loads in 2008 jbi operates 39161 companycontrolled containers systemwide the entire fleet comprises 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality jbi also manages a fleet of 2124 companyowned tractors and 2633 company drivers that provide efficiency to our intermodal operations at december 31 2008 the total jbi employee count was 2913 revenue for the jbi segment in 2008 was 195 billion compared with 165 billion in 2007 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs offers transportation services that generally are not provided by common truckload carriers or intermodal due to strict service requirements specialized equipment and intense driver and delivery personnel demands our operations are managed on site by transportation professionals who work in concert daily with the customer and our drivers to ensure we deliver their product or service on time in a safe and costeffective manner all operations are governed by longerterm contracts that typically include fixed cost components related to dedicated specialized equipment and fuel surcharge programs on roundtrip miles these contracts combined with our bestinclass execution allow dcs to retain its customer base with consistent margins 

  

dcs revenue for 2008 was 927 million compared with 937 million in 2007 at december 31 2008 our segment operated 4454 companycontrolled trucks 101 customerowned trucks and 67 independent contractor trucks the dcs segment employed 5444 people at december 31 2008 

  

jbt segment 

  

the service offering in this segment is fullload dryvan freight utilizing tractors operating over roads and highways we typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee we use our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers at december 31 2008 we had 841 independent contractors operating in the jbt segment some of whom were leasing companyowned tractors jbt revenue for 2008 was 676 million compared with 842 million in 2007 at december 31 2008 the jbt segment operated 2489 companyowned tractors and employed 3030 people 2750 of whom were drivers 

  

in 2008 we entered into a plan to further reduce the size of our jbt fleet and sell approximately 1100 trailers this plan is consistent with our strategy as an assetlight transportation company and our focus for growth and investment in segments that provide the desired margins we expect to sell or trade this equipment during calendar year 2009 

  

ics segment 

  

ics provides nonasset assetlight and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of thirdparty carriers and integration with jbhtowned equipment by leveraging the jbht brand systems and network ics brings a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed refrigerated expedited and ltl as well as a variety of dryvan and intermodal solutions ics provides single source logistics management for customers that desire to outsource their transportation functions and utilize jbht’s proven supplychain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency ics operates outside offices as well as onsite logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers ics revenue for 2008 was 209 million compared with 92 million in 2007 at december 31 2008 the ics segment employed 278 people 

  

logistics business and affiliated company 

  

we own a 37 equity interest in a global transportation and logistics company transplace inc tpi tpi is coowned by five large transportation companies and provides a blend of logistics technology and 

  

  

transportation management services our share of tpi’s financial results is included on a oneline nonoperating item included on our consolidated statements of earnings titled “equity in loss of affiliated company” 

  

marketing and operations 

  

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including general merchandise food and beverages forest and paper products building materials chemicals and automotive parts our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of fortune 500 companies our ability to offer multiple services utilizing our four business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties represents a competitive advantage we provide a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers we have no customers that represent 10 or more of our total revenue in 2008 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we use a specific sales force in dcs due to the length complexity and specialization of the sales cycle and ics has its own proactive local branch salespeople in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided 

  

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2008 we had 14667 employees including 10022 company drivers 1197 mechanics and 3448 office personnel we also had arrangements with more than 900 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

revenue equipment 

  

our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars we continue the process of expanding our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet the composition of our dcs trailing fleet also varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers our jbt segment operates primarily with 53foot dryvan trailers we continue to execute our strategy of reducing the size of the jbt segment we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment however certain loads will utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractors powering our trailing equipment 

  

as of december 31 2008 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 9067 units in addition we had 912 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets based on our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is extremely diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2008 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 33 years our containers averaged 53 years of age and our trailers averaged 72 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

  

effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines the 2007 epacompliant engines show a slight reduction in miles per gallon and an increase in operating costs further the acquisition costs of these new engines have increased by approximately 10 a new set of more stringent emissions standards will become effective for newly manufactured tractor engines in january 2010 

  

  

competition and the industry 

  

the freight transportation market in which we operate is frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive our jbi segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies as well as other fullload carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service considering the diversified nature of the services provided by our dcs segment competition ranges from large diversified carriers to local transportation and delivery service carriers our ics segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other nonassetbased logistics companies and freight brokers as well as fullload carriers the fullload freight competition of our jbt segment includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

  

we compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of ontime pickup and delivery service price revenue equipment and availability of carriers for logistics services 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries 

  

in november 2008 the fmcsa adopted final provisions of the agency’s december 17 2007 interim final rule concerning hours of service for commercial vehicle drivers this final rule allows drivers to continue to drive up to 11 hours within a 14hour nonextendable window from the start of the workday following at least 10 consecutive hours off duty the rule also allows motor carriers and drivers to continue to restart calculations of weekly onduty limits after the driver has at least 34 consecutive hours off duty the rule was effective january 19 2009 we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations recent economic trends and the current tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability and the ability of our suppliers to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices fuel taxes interest rates insurance premiums selfinsurance levels excess capacity in the trucking industry license and registration fees terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment surpluses in the market for used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and 

  

  

our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our ics business segment utilizes thirdparty carriers aside from periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain loads we do not own or control the revenue equipment or drivers delivering the loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2008 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 35 of our revenue our jbi jbt and ics segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings during 2006 and 2007 the selfinsured portion of our claims exposure for all claims was 500000 per occurrence during 2008 the selfinsured portion of our claims was 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected we have renewed our policies for 2009 with substantially the same terms as our 2008 policies we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

  

we continue to monitor actions taken by the fmcsa significant changes in hoursofservice regulations and other motor carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping equipment 

  

  

effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines the acquisition costs of these new engines have increased by approximately 10 a new set of more stringent emissions standards will become effective for newly manufactured tractor engines in january 2010 while it is too early to assess the impact of the new standards our fuel costs operating costs and acquisition costs could be impacted 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  

during the past several years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2008 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations 

  

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers delivery personnel and thirdparty carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

periodically we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers including independent contractors if we are unable to continue attracting an adequate number of employees or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package let revenue equipment sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether which could adversely affect our growth and profitability in addition our ics segment growth could be limited by an inability to attract thirdparty carriers which we rely upon to provide transportation services 

  

we operate in a competitive and somewhat fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

we compete with many other transportation services providers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with ltl carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do additionally some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins 

  

in an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses a customer often selects socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors also certain customers that 

  

  

operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations thereby reducing their need for our services 

  

extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations impact freight volumes and increase our costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results 

  

certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations increases in costs relating to towing and other maintenance frequently occur during the winter months of our business natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs   we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions accidents and cargo claims most of our insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period inception this contractual premium adjustment factor is used to convert 

  

  

the selfinsured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims our estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes these premium adjustment factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occur 

  

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates during 2006 and 2007 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury property damage and workers’ compensation for 2008 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million for workers’ compensation we have renewed our policies for 2009 with substantially the same terms as our 2008 policies 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2008 we had an accrual of approximately 18 million for estimated net claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2008 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 50 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums we are also substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

  

revenue equipment   we operate a significant number of tractors trucks containers and trailers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under operating lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment that is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment we have not identified any impairment to our remaining assets at december 31 2008 

  

we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for tradein values it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided accordingly a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor we are a principal in the transaction we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing additionally we are responsible for carrier selection with respect to our ics business 

  

  

our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 

  

income taxes   we account for income taxes under the assetandliability method in accordance with current accounting standards our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the morelikelythannot threshold a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision we have not recorded a valuation allowance at december 31 2008 as all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 

  

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

  

year in review 

  

significant events for calendar year 2008 include 

  

·   reported seventh consecutive year of record revenues

  

·   reduced our total debt by approximately 280 million or 31

  

·   continued strategy of transitioning our economic model from that of a primarily assetbased truckload carrier to an assetlight transportation company

  

·   designated approximately 1100 trailers in our jbt segment to be sold or traded in 2009 in connection with our strategy to reduce the jbt segment fleet size to the appropriate level

  

·   increased our quarterly dividend to 010 per share in january 2008 from 009 in 2007 and announced an increase to 011 per share effective february 2009

  

our 2008 net earnings of 2006 million or 156 per diluted share were down 6 from the 2131 million or 155 per diluted share earned in 2007 a slowing freight environment and increased fuel costs were our major challenges for 2008 despite decreasing fuel prices in the second half of 2008 compared with the first half fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during 2008 our 2008 fuel cost per gallon averaged 30 above 2007 levels however due to our fuel surcharge programs we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 

  

freight demand during 2008 was up for our jbi and ics segments demand for dryvan truck capacity was softer particularly during the fourth quarter 2008 our jbi and ics segments grew operating income by 6 and 146 respectively dcs showed a small decline in operating income of 2 

  

  

while jbt declined 96 from 2007 in response to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital we increased our jbi tractor and container counts by 18 and 15 respectively as well as increased our dcs trailer count by 11 we reduced our jbt companyowned tractor fleet by 27 excluding tractors designated as held for sale we were able to effect some of these changes by transferring revenue equipment among our fleets 

  

our 2008 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 904 compared with 894 in 2007 our 2008 operating income reflected 39 million of pretax charges to write down the value of certain assets held for sale operating income in 2007 reflected 84 million of pretax charges related to assets held for sale 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

2008 compared with 2007 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 37 billion in 2008 a 69 increase over 2007 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 730 million in 2008 compared with 480 million in 2007 this fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years our 2008 revenue decreased less than 1 from 2007 a 135 and 1173 increase in 2008 jbi and ics load volume respectively contributed to our higher levels of revenue the increases in revenue of our jbi and ics segments were partially offset by decreases in our dcs segment as a result of decreased activity for delivery service accounts due to the overall economic slowdown and weak housing market our jbt segment revenue decreased as a result of rate declines and reduced tractor utilization as a result of decreasing freight demand in the jbt segment 

  

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our total 2008 consolidated operating expenses increased 81 over 2007 and offset the impact of the 69 increase in 2008 revenue over 2007 that resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to 904 from 894 in 2007 rents and purchased transportation costs rose 197 in 2008 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads drayage companies and thirdparty carriers servicing ics the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits decreased 33 in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to decreases in total driver pay this reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a 24 decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 123 in 2008 primarily due to 297 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national regional or local fuel prices while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly most also reflect a specified milespergallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs eg 005 per gallon to trigger an increase in fuel surcharge revenue as a result some of these programs have a timing lag between when the cost is incurred and when it is recovered this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 

  

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases partly due to empty miles run and engineidling time we are typically able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 

  

two additional factors related to fuel costs and fuel surcharge revenue primarily impact jbt operating income when fuel costs change rapidly some freight services incur empty miles and we may be unable to charge fuel surcharge revenue on those miles in addition most systems and software applications utilized in the truckload industry for measuring miles and billing revenue result in computations that average 10 to 12 fewer miles than what is actually traveled hub miles the combination of these two factors frequently results in no fuel surcharge revenue billed for approximately 20 to 25 of the applicable miles actually traveled during times of rapidly changing fuel costs operating income from these services can be significantly impacted 

  

the 14 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to fewer tractors owned in our jbt and dcs segments operating supplies and expenses rose 15 in 2008 primarily as a result of increased costs in airfare and travel expenses insurance and claims expense decreased 128 due to fewer accidents and lower claims costs the 142 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in other driving expenses due to a decrease in the number of drivers and a decrease in the charge to write down to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale compared with the 2007 writedown in addition gains on asset sales were 12 million in 2008 compared with losses on asset sales of 04 million in 2007 

  

net interest expense for 2008 decreased by 189 compared with 2007 this decrease was due to reduced outstanding debt balances as well as reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt interest expense was further reduced by a refund of interest previously paid to the internal revenue service irs from the 1999 tax case settlement and lower accrued interest on uncertain tax positions 

  

our effective income tax rate was 378 in 2008 and 344 in 2007 the increase in 2008 was primarily due to the 2007 rate being reduced by our 1999 tax case settlement in 2007 see the section comparing 2007 with 2006 operating results for further details of this settlement we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 38 for calendar year 2009 the “equity in loss of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 

  

  

segments 

  

we operated four business segments during calendar year 2008 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

  

operating revenue by segment 

  

   

operating income by segment 

  

   

   

  

operating data by segment 

  

   

   

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue grew by 181 to 195 billion in 2008 from 165 billion in 2007 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 135 increase in load volume the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily the result of a 41 increase in revenue per load including fuel surcharges partially offset by a 43 decrease in the average length of haul 

  

operating income in our jbi segment rose to 254 million in 2008 from 239 million in 2007 while increased volumes contributed to higher operating margins we were able to increase our driver productivity and significantly reduce our reliance on thirdparty equipment and drayage all of these factors contributed to our operating income increasing by 63 in 2008 

  

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue declined 10 to 927 million in 2008 from 937 million in 2007 this decrease in revenue was primarily due to an 88 decrease in average length of haul and lower load counts as we worked with our customers to reach the optimum fleet size for their businesses 

  

operating income decreased to 92 million in 2008 compared with 94 million in 2007 this decrease in operating income was due to decreased revenue and higher fuel and operating costs these higher operating expenses relative to 2007 were offset by decreases in equipment rental costs and lower insurance and claim costs 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue declined 196 to 676 million in 2008 from 842 million in 2007 the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a 209 decrease in load count due to much softer demand in 2008 than in 2007 

  

operating income in our jbt segment declined to 14 million in 2008 from 32 million in 2007 mainly due to reduced revenue and higher fuel costs 

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue grew 1285 to 209 million in 2008 from 92 million in 2007 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 1173 increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 

  

operating income increased nearly 146 to 11 million in 2008 compared with 4 million in 2007 the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment in 2008 we continued to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover higher operating expenses 

  

2007 compared with 2006 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 35 billion in 2007 a 49 increase over 2006 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of 480 million in 2007 compared with 430 million in 2006 this fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years the increase of 2007 revenue over 2006 was 39 this increased level of revenue excluding fsc was primarily the result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacitymanagement actions and ics business growth a 173 and 1484 increase in 2007 jbi and ics load volume respectively contributed to our higher levels of revenue the increases in revenue of our jbi dcs and ics segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet rate declines and reduced tractor utilization due to decreasing freight demand in the jbt segment 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our total 2007 consolidated operating expenses increased 56 over 2006 the combination of the 49 increase in 2007 revenue over 2006 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to 894 from 888 in 2006 rents and purchased transportation costs rose 98 in 2007 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads drayage companies and thirdparty carriers servicing ics this increase was partially offset by a decrease in trailing equipment rentals due to our decision to purchase certain trailing equipment off operating leases during 2007 the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits decreased less than 1 in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to decreases in total driver pay this reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a 27 decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment 

  

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 36 in 2007 primarily due to 69 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon the 117 increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our purchases of trailing equipment including new containers and chassis for our jbi segment as well as trailers purchased off operating leases operating supplies and expenses rose 69 in 2007 partly as a result of higher revenue equipment maintenance including tractors and trailing equipment as well as increased tire costs the 451 increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the 84 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter to write down the value of certain assets held for sale to fair value less costs to sell this increase was also due to losses on asset sales of 04 million in 2007 compared with gains on asset sales of 29 million in 2006 

  

our effective income tax rate was 344 in 2007 and 379 in 2006 the decrease in our effective tax rate compared with the prioryear rate is primarily the result of our settlement on a proposed irs adjustment which resulted in a 121 million decrease of income tax expense in the second quarter 2007 see note 6 income taxes for further information regarding this settlement the “equity in loss of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue grew by 156 to 165 billion in 2007 from 143 billion in 2006 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 173 increase in load volume the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily the result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue per load due to a 32 decrease in the average length of haul from 2006 

  

operating income in our jbi segment rose to 239 million in 2007 from 182 million in 2006 while increased volumes contributed to higher operating margins we were able to reduce the number of empty truck miles in our pickup and delivery operations increase our driver productivity and significantly reduce our reliance on thirdparty equipment and drayage all of these factors contributed to increasing our operating income by 314 in 2007 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue grew 23 to 937 million in 2007 from 915 million in 2006 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 14 increase in revenue per truck per week and slightly higher load counts from customer demand 

  

operating income decreased to 94 million in 2007 compared with 104 million in 2006 the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of an increase in driver compensation increases in fuel costs and higher casualty and workers’ compensation costs in 2007 compared with 2006 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue declined 128 to 842 million in 2007 from 966 million in 2006 the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a 91 decrease in load count due to much softer demand in 2007 compared with 2006 an approximate 2 decrease in rates also contributed to the decrease in revenue 

  

operating income in our jbt segment declined to 32 million in 2007 from 84 million in 2006 in addition to reduced revenue from lower load volume operating expenses were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 due to increases in tractor maintenance and tire costs also we recorded an 84 million pretax charge in december 2007 to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 

  

  

ics segment 

  

ics segment revenue grew 1189 to 92 million in 2007 from 42 million in 2006 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 1484 increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 

  

operating income increased nearly 277 to 4 million in 2007 compared with 3 million in 2006 the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment in the second half of 2007 we were able to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover higher operating expenses 

  

liquidity and capital resources   net cash provided by operating activities was 505 million in 2008 458 million in 2007 and 423 million in 2006 the increase in 2008 cash provided by operating activities relative to 2007 after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation sharebased compensation and impairment charges was due primarily to the timing of cash activity related to trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable as well as tax payments 

  

cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflected additions to and disposals from our fleet of revenue equipment the lower level of cash used in investing activities during 2008 partly reflected our strategy of reduced investment in the assetbased operations of our jbt segment 

  

net cash used in financing activities during 2008 increased over 2007 primarily due to repayments on our revolving lines of credit in 2008 compared with cash provided by issuance of our senior notes and borrowings on our revolving lines of credit in 2007 cash provided by increased borrowings in 2007 was primarily used for company stock purchases and capital expenditures 

  

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition earnings capital requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid an 008 per share quarterly dividend in 2006 a 009 per share quarterly dividend in 2007 and a 010 per share quarterly dividend in 2008 in february 2009 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 010 to 011 effective with our payment in february 2009 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal trailing equipment trucks tractors and dryvan trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new latemodel equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have during the past few years obtained capital through cash generated from operations revolving lines of credit and longterm debt issuances we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment to date none of our operating leases contains any residual value guarantees 

  

at december 31 2008 we were authorized to borrow up to a total of 425 million under two different revolving lines of credit the first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks for a total commitment amount of 350 million which expires march 29 2012 the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating at december 31 2008 we had 1150 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 195 under this agreement 

  

our second line of credit is an accounts receivable securitization program with a revolvingcredit facility up to 75 million this facility is secured by our accounts receivable and we renewed this facility at maturity on july 28 2008 for a oneyear term maturing on july 27 2009 the applicable interest rate under this agreement is the prevailing a1p1 commercial paper rate in the market plus a margin based 

  

  

on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees at december 31 2008 we had 50 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 361 under this agreement 

  

in march 2007 we sold 200 million of 531 senior notes 2011 notes which mature march 29 2011 to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated march 15 2007 the proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases and for general working capital purposes the 2011 notes were issued at par value interest payments are due semiannually in march and september of each year 

  

in july 2007 we sold 200 million of 608 senior notes 2014 notes which mature july 26 2014 to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated july 15 2007 proceeds from these notes were used to purchase shares of our common stock pay down existing debt on our revolvingcredit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment principal payments in the amount of 500 million are due july 26 2012 and july 26 2013 with the remainder due upon maturity interest payments are due semiannually in january and july of each year the note purchase agreements describe the terms and conditions of both notes which include requirements to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 

  

in september 2006 we entered into a 100 million term loan and credit agreement in connection with our purchase of used dryvan trailers this 100 million facility is collateralized by a security interest in the trailing equipment and matures september 29 2009 we are required to make minimum quarterly principal payments in the amount of 35 million through june 29 2009 with the remainder due upon maturity stated interest on this facility is a threemonth libor variable rate concurrent with the loan and credit agreement we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of 585 the swap expires september 29 2009 when the related term loan is due at december 31 2008 we had 685 million outstanding under this term loan facility 

  

our revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2008 

  

we believe that our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock 

  

we are currently committed to spend approximately 140 million net of proceeds from sales or tradeins during 2009 which is primarily related to tractors and containers 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

our offbalance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and facilities as of december 31 2008 we had less than 200000 of obligations on the trailing equipment leases and approximately 41 million on the facilities leases 

  

   

  

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 113 million at december 31 2008 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2009 which are related to 1 our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims and 2 our operating lease agreements we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 184 million of liabilities under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 48 as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

fair value measurements 

  

effective january 1 2008 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements fas 157 and statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115 fas 159 see note 10 fair value measurements for the impact of these adoptions 

  

in february 2008 the fasb issued staff position fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157  which delayed the effective date of fas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis until january 1 2009 we will adopt the provisions of fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2009 however we are still evaluating the impact if any this will have on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in october 2008 the fasb issued staff position fas 1573 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  fsp 1573 fsp 1573 clarifies the application of fas 157 in cases where a market is not active we have considered the guidance provided by fsp 1573 in our determination of estimated fair values as of december 31 2008 and the impact was not material 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

of our total 6335 million of debt we had 1650 million of variable rate debt outstanding at december 31 2008 under our revolving lines of credit the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm interest rates risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates at our current level of borrowing a 1 increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately 17 million our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate debt and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense periodically we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuelprice increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2008 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

recent focus 

  

  during the past several years we have taken significant steps to reestablish a primary focus on the profitability of our business segments in each segment we have implemented capacitymanagement decisionmaking processes that result in the deployment of our assets where we believe they will generate more profit we continually focus on replacing lessprofitable freight with highermargin freight and lanes selective pricing actions and ensuring that we properly charge for all services provided have also been areas of major focus recent examples of actions taken to redeploy our assets include 1 a decision to sell certain revenue equipment within our jbt business segment 2 expanding the number of thirdparty carriers that provide us with transportation services and 3 growing our ics business with new and existing customers each of these are discussed in more detail in the operating segments’ sections 

  

  increasingly our customers are seeking energyefficient transportation solutions to reduce both cost and greenhousegas emissions our intermodal service addresses both demands we are also beginning to customize dedicated solutions aimed at minimizing transportationrelated carbon emissions efforts to improve fleet fuel efficiency are ongoing and we are an environmental protection agency epa smartway sm transport partner 

  

  in addition fundamental changes in shipper supplychain transportation logistics have resulted in the conversion of freight from traditional random truckload to intermodal and dedicated operations we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and conduct all of our operations as safely as possible 

  

operating segments 

  

  segment information is also included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

jbi segment 

  

  the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 with a unique 

  

  

  

partnership with the former santa fe railway now the bnsf railway company a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment essentially jbi draws on the intermodal also known as “container on flatcar” services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries “drayage” for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations we may directly provide the drayage service at either the origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our companyowned tractors or we may purchase these services from third parties jbi provides seamless coordination of the rail and overtheroad transport movements for our customers and delivers a single billing for the complete doortodoor service 

  

  our intermodal program has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to more than 738000 in 2007 jbi operates 34019 companycontrolled containers system wide the entire fleet comprises 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality jbi also manages a fleet of 1795 companyowned tractors and 2232 company drivers in support of intermodal operations at december 31 2007 the total jbi employee count was 2494 revenue for the jbi segment in calendar year 2007 was 165 billion compared with 143 billion in 2006 as previously announced an arbitration process with the bnsf railway company bni was concluded during the third quarter 2005 in accordance with the settlement terms we paid bni 258 million in addition this settlement also resulted in higher rail purchased transportation expenses effective october 1 2005 normal commercial business activity continued with bni during the approximate 15month arbitration process and normal business operations have continued since the final settlement 

  

dcs segment 

  

  since 1992 we have offered dedicated contract carriage as a service option our dcs segment operations specialize in the design development and execution of customerspecific fleet solutions capitalizing on advanced systems and technologies dcs offers transportation engineering solutions that support private fleet conversion dedicated fleet creation and transportation system augmentation dcs operations typically provide customized services that are governed by longterm contracts and currently include dryvan flatbed temperaturecontrolled dump trailers and local innercity operations 

  

  dcs operations focus on delivering recognizable customer value through bestinclass service cost control and guaranteed dedicated capacity we utilize a proprietary methodology known as customer value delivery ® cvd to create measure and communicate value generated for each customer dcs leverages the jbht freight network to reposition equipment near outbound domiciles thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost we also frequently find synergy in shared resources with the jbt and jbi segments including terminals drivers maintenance shops bulk fuel locations and trailer pools providing further economies of scale dcs revenue for calendar year 2007 was 937 million compared with 915 million in 2006 in early 2004 dcs began utilizing independent contractors ics and at december 31 2007 we had 100 ics operating in this segment at december 31 2007 our segment operated 4941 companycontrolled and 92 customerowned trucks and employed 6041 people 5262 of whom were drivers 

  

jbt segment 

  

  our primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment include fullload dryvan freight which is predominantly transported utilizing companycontrolled tractors operating over roads and highways we pick up our freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee our loads are transported by our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or by ics who agree to transport freight in our trailers this type of freight movement typically results in our billing the customer for all applicable freight charges and in turn paying the third party for their portion of the transportation services provided this type of service usually results in our recognition of revenue for the entire billing and the payment to the third party being classified as purchased transportation expense 

  

  

  

  we operate under the approval of certain canadian authorities allowing us to transport freight to and from all points in the continental united states to quebec british columbia and ontario we have authorization to operate directly in substantially all the canadian provinces but to date we have served limited points in canada primarily through interchange operations with canadian motor carriers in late 2000 we began utilizing ics in the jbt segment and at december 31 2007 we had 978 ics operating in the jbt segment some of whom were leasing companyowned tractors jbt revenue for calendar year 2007 was 842 million compared with 966 million in 2006 at december 31 2007 the jbt segment operated 3572 companyowned tractors and employed 4517 people 3635 of whom were drivers a portion of our jbt segment nondriver employees provide freight solicitation order entry and other operational support services to our other two segments we record intersegment credits and charges to properly reflect these intersegment support services 

  

in december 2007 we entered into a plan to reduce the size of our jbt fleet and sell approximately 700 tractors and 2500 trailers this plan is consistent with our strategy to move our economic model from that of a primarily assetbased truckload carrier to an assetlight transportation company and our focus for growth and investment in segments that provide the desired margins we expect to sell this equipment during calendar year 2008 as a result of the plan we recorded a pretax charge of 84 million in december 2007 to reduce the carrying value of the revenue equipment to estimated fair value less costs to sell 

  

ics segment 

  

  ics provides nonasset and assetlight transportation solutions to customers through relationships with thirdparty carriers and integration with jbht owned equipment this type of freight movement typically results in our billing the customer for all applicable freight charges and in turn paying the third party for their portion of the transportation services provided this type of service usually results in our recognition of revenue for the entire billing and the payment to the third party being classified as purchased transportation expense ics services include flatbed refrigerated and lessthantruckload ltl as well as a variety of dry van and intermodal solutions ics revenue for calendar year 2007 was 92 million compared with 42 million in 2006 at december 31 2007 the ics segment employed approximately 120 people 

  

  prior to 2007 ics financial results were reported as part of the jbt segment beginning january 1 2007 we began reporting ics results separately prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect this change 

  

logistics business and affiliated company 

  

  effective july 1 2000 we contributed an existing logistics segment business to a newly formed company transplace inc tpi tpi is a nonassetbased thirdparty logistics provider offering a blend of logistics technology and transportation management services our share of tpi’s financial results is included on a oneline nonoperating item included on our consolidated statements of earnings titled “equity in loss of affiliated company” 

  

operations in mexico     we have provided transportation services to and from mexico since 1989 these services typically involve equipment interchange operations with various mexican motor carriers we provide transportation services to and from mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of mexican carriers 

  

marketing and operations 

  

  we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including forest and paper products building materials general merchandise food and beverages chemicals and automotive parts our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of fortune 500 companies our ability to offer multiple services utilizing our four business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties represents a competitive advantage we provide a broad range of 

  

  

  

transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers our largest customer in 2007 was walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue 

  

  we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we do have some sales and marketing functions managed at the businessunit level particularly for our dcs segment in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided in recent years we have reestablished a primary focus on improving the profitability of each of our business segments and charging a fair price for all services provided 

  

people 

  

  we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2007 we had 15795 employees including 11129 company drivers 1177 mechanics and 3489 office personnel we also had arrangements with 1084 ics to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

  while we experienced improvements in 2007 relative to the past few years our industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough qualified truck drivers it is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100 it has been our practice to compensate our drivers at an aboveaverage level in order to attract a higher caliber of experience and minimize turnover while we have not to date experienced significant operational disruptions due to driver shortages we expect the costs to recruit train and retain company drivers and ics will continue to rise in the foreseeable future 

  

revenue equipment 

  

  as of december 31 2007 our companyowned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 10308 units in addition we had 1084 ics who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets based on our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is more diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2007 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 30 years our trailers averaged 64 years of age and our containers averaged 57 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

  

  our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars we are currently in the process of expanding our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we typically operate newer revenue equipment in our jbt segment to minimize downtime and maximize utilization we primarily utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ics segment however certain loads will utilize thirdparty carriers’ tractors powering our trailing equipment 

  

  in december 2007 we initiated a plan to sell certain revenue equipment in our jbt segment this plan is an effort to continue moving our current economic model from that of a primarily assetbased truckload carrier of the past to an assetlight transportation company while reducing the jbt fleet until acceptable margins and returns on invested capital are achieved terms of the plan include approximately 700 tractors and 2500 trailers to be sold during calendar year 2008 

  

  effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines the 2007 epacompliant engines require more costly ultralowsulfur diesel ulsd fuel current market information and our experience to date indicates that ulsd fuel costs approximately 002 to 005 more per gallon in 2006 we began testing the modelyear 2007 

  

  

  

engines in a group of our tractors to date we have seen a slight reduction in miles per gallon due to using ulsd fuel and these new 2007 epacompliant engines and an increase in operating costs further the acquisition costs of these new engines has increased by approximately 10 a new set of more stringent emissions standards will become effective for newlymanufactured tractor engines in january 2010 

  

competition and the industry 

  

  the market in which we compete is frequently referred to as highly fragmented and includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country we compete with other freight transportation carriers primarily in terms of ontime pickup and delivery service availability of drivers and revenue equipment and price 

  

regulation 

  

  our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries 

  

  in july 2007 the dc circuit court of appeals vacated certain provisions contained in the hoursofservice hos regulations issued by the fmcsa the 11hourlimit rule which restricts drivers to 11 hours of driving time within a 14hour period from the start of the workday and the 34hourrestart rule which allows drivers to restart their weekly onduty calculations after 34 consecutive hours off duty were vacated by the court’s decision in september 2007 subsequent to petitions and motions by various groups the court granted a 90day delay in the effective date of its ruling in december 2007 the fmcsa temporarily reinstated the vacated provisions until it gathers public comment and safety analysis information before issuing a final ruling the public comment period extends until march 17 2008 there has been no lapse in these rules since they were issued by the fmcsa in 2005 we continue to monitor the actions of the fmcsa 

  




 item 1a  risk factors 

  

  in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks also note that additional risks not currently identified or known to us could also negatively impact our business or financial results 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

  our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices excess capacity in the trucking industry interest rates fuel taxes license and registration fees insurance premiums selfinsurance levels interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment surpluses in the market for used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 

  

  we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a 

  

  

  

significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for baddebt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

we operate in a competitive and somewhat fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

  some of these factors include 

  

·   we compete with many other transportation carriers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with lessthantruckload carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do 

  

·   some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins 

  

·   many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected 

  

·   many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors 

  

·   certain of our customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations 

  

·   consolidation in the transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages related to their size 

  

·   advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  for the calendar year ended december 31 2007 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 38 of our revenue our largest customer walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 12 of our total revenue in 2007 our jbt and jbi segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

  our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services the majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railways the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results we also utilize the services of a number of thirdparty dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and destination pickups and deliveries in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united 

  

  

  

states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  our ics business segment utilizes thirdparty carriers aside from periodic use of our trailing equipment to satisfy certain loads we do not own the revenue equipment nor do we employ the drivers delivering the loads the inability to obtain reliable thirdparty carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth 

  

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

  periodically the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers including ics if we are unable to continue attracting an adequate number of drivers or contract with enough ics we could be required to significantly increase our driver compensation package or let revenue equipment sit idle which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

  our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings during 2005 we selfinsured a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage and health claims for amounts up to the first 2 million for auto accidents and 1 million for workers’ compensation during 2006 and 2007 the selfinsured portion of our claims exposure for all claims was 500000 per occurrence if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected the selfinsured portion of our claims will be 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation during 2008 we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

  we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

  the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

  

  we continue to monitor actions taken by the fmcsa significant changes in hoursofservice and other motor carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping equipment 

  

  

  

  effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines the 2007 epacompliant engines require more costly ultralowsulfur diesel ulsd fuel further the acquisition costs of these new engines has increased by approximately 10 a new set of more stringent emissions standards will become effective for newlymanufactured tractor engines in january 2010 while it is too early to assess the impact of the new standards our fuel costs operating costs and acquisition costs could be impacted 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  

  during the past several years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2007 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuelprice fluctuations

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

  the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs     we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions accidents and cargo claims most of our insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period inception this contractual adjustment factor is used to convert the selfinsured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims our estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes these premium factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occur 

  

  the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates during 2005 we were selfinsured for 2 million per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation claims during 2006 and 2007 we were selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury property damage and workers’ compensation for 2008 we are selfinsured for 500000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and 1 million for workers’ compensation claims 

  

  

  

  our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2007 we had an accrual of approximately 19 million for estimated net claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2007 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 53 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums we are also substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

  

revenue equipment     we operate a significant number of tractors trucks trailers and containers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment see note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment we have not identified any impairments to our remaining assets 

  

  we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for tradein values it could have a material negative impact on our financial results we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december 31 2007 and 2006 

  

revenue recognition     we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported accordingly a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments are based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility the adequacy of our allowances and reserves is reviewed quarterly 

  

income taxes   we account for income taxes under the assetandliability method in accordance with current accounting standards our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe recovery is not probable a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our 

  

  

  

income tax provision we have not recorded a valuation allowance at december 31 2007 as all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 

  

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates further a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

  

year in review 

  

highlights of significant events for calendar year 2007 include 

  

·   sixth consecutive year of record revenues 

  

·   continued strategy of transitioning our economic model from that of a primarily assetbased truckload carrier to an assetlight transportation company 

  

·   designated approximately 700 tractors and 2500 trailers in our jbt segment to sell in calendar year 2008 in connection with our strategy to reduce the jbt segment fleet size to the appropriate level incurring a 84 million pretax charge to record the revenue equipment to estimated fair value less costs to sell 

  

·   completed a post appeals mediation with the irs and agreed to a settlement of a saleandleaseback transaction and other uncertain tax positions related to irs audits for tax years 19982003 this settlement resulted in a 495 million payment to the irs 

  

·   announced a new business segment integrated capacity solutions consistent with our assetlight transportation company strategy 

  

·   purchased 217 million shares of our common stock totaling 6034 million in 2007 completing a series of authorized stock purchase programs totaling 11 billion or 445 million shares that commenced in calendar year 2005 

  

·   issued 400 million in senior notes through two issuances maturing in 2011 and 2014 with proceeds used for stock purchases revenue equipment purchases primarily for our jbi and dcs segments and other general working capital purposes 

  

·   increased our quarterly dividend to 009 per share in january 2007 from 008 in 2006 and announced an additional increase to a 010 quarterly dividend effective february 2008 

  

our 2007 net earnings of 2131 million or 155 per diluted share were down 3 from the 2200 million or 144 per diluted share earned in 2006 fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during 2007 our 2007 fuel cost per gallon averaged 69 above 2006 levels however due to our fuel surcharge programs we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 

  

freight demand during 2007 was relatively consistent for our jbi and dcs segments demand for dryvan truck capacity was softer particularly during the fourth quarter 2007 comparisons of 2007 dryvan volumes to 2006 were negatively impacted by freight recessions including lowerthanexpected 

  

  

  

seasonal demand during august through november of 2007 our jbi segment contributed to our higher level of profitability in 2007 growing operating income by 31 while our jbt and dcs segments experienced a decline in operating income as compared with 2006 of 62 and 10 respectively in response to changing market conditions and in continuance of focusing on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital we increased our jbi tractor and container counts by 14 and 23 respectively as well as increasing our dcs trailer count by 26 we reduced our jbt companyowned tractor fleet by 16 excluding tractors designated as held for sale we were able to affect some of these changes by transferring revenue equipment among our fleets 

  

we also continued our focus on capacity management during 2007 capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight demand on a daily basis and our contractual relationships to determine which business application and segment generates the best returns we also continually analyze our business to ensure that we are charging a fair price for all services we provide our capacity management actions and changes in the shipper supply chain resulted in the conversion of freight from overtheroad truck operations to intermodal and dedicated services 

  

  our 2007 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 894 compared with 888 in 2006 the current year was the fourth consecutive time that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 90 our 2007 operating income reflected an 84 million pretax charge to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 

  

results of operations 

  

  the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

  

  

2007 compared with 2006 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

  our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 35 billion in 2007 a 49 increase over 2006 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of 480 million in 2007 compared with 430 million in 2006 this fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years the increase of 2007 revenue over 2006 was 39 this increased level of revenue excluding fsc was primarily a result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions and ics business growth a 173 and 1484 increase in 2007 jbi and ics load volume respectively contributed to our higher levels of revenue the increases in revenue of our jbi dcs and ics segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet rate declines and reduced tractor utilization due to decreasing freight demand in the jbt segment 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

  our total 2007 consolidated operating expenses increased 56 over 2006 the combination of the 49 increase in 2007 revenue over 2006 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to 894 from 888 in 2006 rents and purchased transportation costs rose 98 in 2007 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads drayage companies and thirdparty carriers servicing ics this increase was partially offset by a decrease in trailing equipment rentals due to our decision to purchase certain trailing equipment off operating leases during 2007 the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits decreased less than 1 in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to decreases in total driver pay this reduction in total driver pay was primarily a result of a 27 decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment 

  

  fuel and fuel taxes expense increased 36 in 2007 primarily due to 69 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases partly due to empty miles run and engineidling time we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 

  

the 117 increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our purchases of trailing equipment including new containers and chassis for our jbi segment as well as trailers purchased off operating leases operating supplies and expenses rose 69 in 2007 partly as a result of higher revenue equipment maintenance including tractors and trailing equipment as well as increased tire costs the 451 increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the 84 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter to write down the value of certain assets held for sale to fair value less costs to sell this increase was also due to losses on asset sales of 04 million in 2007 compared with gains on asset sales of 29 million in 2006 

  

our effective income tax rate was 344 in 2007 and 379 in 2006 the decrease in our effective tax rate compared with the prioryear rate is primarily the result of our settlement on a proposed internal revenue service irs adjustment which resulted in a 121 million decrease of income tax expense in the second quarter 2007 see note 6 income taxes for further information regarding this settlement we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 39 for calendar year 2008 the “equity in loss of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 

  

  

  

segments 

  

  we operated four business segments during calendar year 2007 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 

  

operating revenue by segment 

  

 

  

operating income by segment

1   includes companyowned and independent contractor tractors for jbi and jbt segments and also includes customerowned trucks for the dcs segment 

2 reflects average use of corporatewide trailing equipment 

3 using weighted workdays 

  

jbi segment 

  

  jbi segment revenue grew by 156 to 165 billion in 2007 from 143 billion in 2006 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 173 increase in load volume the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue per load due to a decrease in the average length of haul of 32 from 2006 

  

  operating income in our jbi segment rose to 239 million in 2007 from 182 million in 2006 while increased volumes contributed to higher operating margins we were able to reduce the number of empty truck miles in our pickup and delivery operations increase our driver productivity and significantly reduce our reliance on thirdparty equipment and drayage all of these factors contributed to increasing our operating income by 314 in 2007 

  

  

  

dcs segment 

  

  dcs segment revenue grew 23 to 937 million in 2007 from 915 million in 2006 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 14 increase in revenue per truck per week and a slightly higher average truck count 

  

  operating income decreased to 94 million in 2007 compared with 104 million in 2006 the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of an increase in driver compensation increases in fuel costs and higher casualty and workers’ compensation costs in 2007 compared with 2006 

  

jbt segment 

  

  jbt segment revenue declined 128 to 842 million in 2007 from 966 million in 2006 the decrease in revenue was primarily a result of a 91 decrease in load count due to much softer demand in 2007 compared with 2006 an approximate 2 decrease in rates also contributed to the decrease in revenue 

  

  operating income in our jbt segment declined to 32 million in 2007 from 84 million in 2006 in addition to reduced revenue from lower load volume operating expenses were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 due to increases in tractor maintenance and tire costs in addition we recorded an 84 million pretax charge in december 2007 to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 

  

ics segment 

  

  ics segment revenue grew 1189 to 92 million in 2007 from 42 million in 2006 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 1484 increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 

  

  operating income increased nearly 277 to 4 million in 2007 compared with 3 million in 2006 the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment in the second half of 2007 we were able to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover higher operating expenses 

  

2006 compared with 2005 

  

overview of consolidated 2006 results 

  

  our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 333 billion in 2006 a 64 increase over 2005 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of 430 million in 2006 compared with 336 million in 2005 this fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years the increase of 2006 revenue over 2005 was 38 this increased level of revenue excluding fsc was primarily a result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions a 51 and 22 increase in 2006 jbi and dcs load volume respectively contributed to our higher levels of revenue the increases in revenue of our jbi and dcs segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet and a decline in tractor utilization demand for dryvan truck capacity was softer particularly during the fourth quarter of 2006 comparisons of 2006 dryvan volumes to 2005 were negatively impacted by hurricane relief shipments in 2005 and lowerthanexpected seasonal demand during august through november of 2006 partly in response to changing market conditions we increased the size of our jbi and dcs tractor fleets by 16 and 7 respectively and decreased our jbt fleet by 6 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

  our total 2006 consolidated operating expenses increased 62 over 2005 the combination of the 64 increase in 2006 revenue over 2005 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our 2006 operating ratio improving slightly to 888 from 890 in 2005 rents and purchased transportation costs rose 63 in 2006 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies 

  

  

  

related to jbi growth the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 43 in 2006 over 2005 primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation 

  

  fuel and fuel taxes expense was up 150 in 2006 primarily due to 126 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases partly due to empty miles run and engineidling time we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 

  

the 126 increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our trailing equipment purchases higher newtractor purchase prices and an approximate 5 increase in the size of our companyowned tractor fleet operating supplies and expenses rose 97 in 2006 partly a result of higher tractor maintenance tires and tolls costs a number of states have raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls the 277 decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects driver recruiting and testing costs legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding and charitable contributions in 2005 that declined or did not reoccur in 2006 also included in the general and administrative expense category we recognized a 29 million net gain on the disposition of assets in 2006 compared with a 18 million gain in 2005 the arbitration settlement expense incurred during 2005 was due to the bni arbitration decision discussed in the section on operating segments 

  

we accrued approximately 30 million of interest expense during 2006 related to an irs contingency our effective income tax rate was 379 in 2006 and 2005 the “equity in loss of affiliated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 

  

jbi segment 

  

  jbi segment revenue grew by 114 to 143 billion in 2006 from 128 billion in 2005 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 51 increase in load volume in addition freight rates increased nearly 4 over 2005 the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue 

  

  operating income in our jbi segment rose to 182 million in 2006 from 124 million in 2005 the 258 million arbitration settlement charge incurred in september 2005 favorably impacted this comparison while this settlement also increased rail purchased transportation expense subsequent to october 1 2005 higher freight rates increased volumes and reduced use of rail control equipment increased 2006 operating income 

  

dcs segment 

  

  dcs segment revenue grew 84 to 915 million in 2006 from 844 million in 2005 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 22 increase in load volume an approximate 4 increase in rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue 

  

  operating income increased to 104 million in 2006 compared with 100 million in 2005 similar to 2005 we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during 2006 generated appropriate financial returns we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate 

  

jbt segment 

  

  jbt segment revenue declined 24 to 966 million in 2006 from 990 million in 2005 this decline was primarily due to a 16 reduction in load volume while rates from consistent shippers increased 

  

  

  

approximately 2 during 2006 a decline in rates from spot and backup pricing and paid empty movements partly offset these increases 

  

  operating income in our jbt segment declined to 84 million in 2006 from 117 million in 2005 the decrease was due in part to lower levels of tractor utilization and to higher driver compensation and insurance costs 

  

liquidity and capital resources     net cash provided by operating activities was 458 million in 2007 423 million in 2006 and 332 million in 2005 the increase in 2007 cash provided by operating activities relative to 2006 after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation sharebased compensation and impairment charges was due primarily to the timing of cash activity related to trade accounts receivable and payable 

  

cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment the lower level of cash used in investing activities during 2007 was primarily a result of decreases in trailingequipment purchases at december 31 2007 we had no revenue equipment on capital leases 

  

  net cash used in financing activities during 2007 increased over 2006 primarily due to the purchase of 603 million of our common stock this increase was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from longterm debt issuances during 2007 we issued 400 million of senior notes funds from these issuances were used primarily for purchases of our company stock purchases of revenue equipment and for general working capital purposes 

  

selected balance sheet data 

  

   

our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition earnings capital requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant we paid a 006 per share dividend in february april july and october 2005 in january 2006 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 006 to 008 we paid an 008 per share dividend in february april july and october 2006 in january 2007 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 008 to 009 effective with our payments in february april july and october 2007 in january 2008 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 009 to 010 effective with our payment in february 2008 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal trailing equipment trucks tractors and dryvan trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new latemodel equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have during the past few years obtained capital through cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit and most recently issued longterm debt to acquire trailers that were previously leased we have also periodically utilized operating leases to 

  

  

  

acquire revenue equipment we had no capital lease arrangements at december 31 2007 to date none of our operating leases contains any guaranteed residual value clauses 

  

at december 31 2007 we were authorized to borrow up to a total of 575 million under two different revolving lines of credit the first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks for a total commitment amount of 350 million effective march 29 2007 we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility agreement which replaced our previous senior revolving credit facility dated april 27 2005 this new credit facility has a fiveyear term expiring march 29 2012 in june 2007 we exercised a feature of the agreement that allowed us to increase our total commitment amount from 250 million to 350 million the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating at december 31 2007 we had 2106 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 584 under this agreement 

  

our second line of credit is an accounts receivable securitization program with a revolvingcredit facility up to 225 million this facility is secured by our accounts receivable and we renewed this facility at maturity on july 30 2007 for a oneyear term maturing on july 28 2008 the applicable interest rate under this agreement is the prevailing a1p1 commercial paper rate in the market plus a margin based on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees at december 31 2007 we had 220 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 532 under this agreement 

  

on march 29 2007 we sold 200 million of 531 senior notes 2011 notes which mature march 29 2011 to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated march 15 2007 the proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases and for general working capital purposes the 2011 notes were issued at par value interest payments are due semiannually in march and september of each year 

  

on july 26 2007 we sold 200 million of 608 senior notes 2014 notes which mature july 26 2014 to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated july 15 2007 proceeds from these notes have been utilized to purchase shares of our common stock pay down existing debt on our revolvingcredit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment the 2014 notes were issued at par value principal payments in the amount of 500 million are due july 26 2012 and july 26 2013 with the remainder due upon maturity interest payments are due semiannually in january and july of each year the note purchase agreements describe the terms and conditions of both notes which include requirements to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 

  

on september 29 2006 we entered into a 100 million term loan and credit agreement in connection with our purchase of used dryvan trailers this 100 million facility is collateralized by a security interest in the trailing equipment and matures september 29 2009 we are required to make minimum quarterly principal payments in the amount of 35 million through june 29 2009 with the remainder due upon maturity stated interest on this facility is a threemonth libor variable rate concurrent with the loan and credit agreement we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of 585 the swap expires september 29 2009 when the related term loan is due at december 31 2007 we had 825 million outstanding under this credit agreement 

  

our revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2007 

  

we believe that our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock 

  

as mentioned above we had significant expenditures related to new trailing equipment for 2007 we are currently committed to spend approximately 1224 million during 2008 which is primarily related to 

  

  

  

tractors and containers the actual cash expended will be net of proceeds from sale or tradein allowances on revenue equipment 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

  our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 303 trailers and 1005 containerschassis that were subject to operating leases and we had approximately 18 million of obligations remaining under these leases 

  

contractual cash obligations 

as of december 31 2007 

000 

  

   

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 113 million at december 31 2007 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2008 which are related to 1 our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims and 2 our operating lease agreements we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements the table above excludes 227 million of liabilities under fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement see note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

fair value measurements 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements fas 157 fas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements fas 157 does not expand or require new fair value measures but is applicable whenever an asset or liability is permitted or required to be measured at fair value fas 157 became effective for us beginning january 1 2008 in february 2008 the fasb agreed to a oneyear delay of fas 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities accordingly adoption of this standard is limited to financial assets and liabilities which primarily applies to the valuation of our interest rate swap we do not believe the initial adoption of fas 157 will have a significant impact on our earnings or financial condition we are still in the process of assessing the impact of fas 157 on our consolidated financial statements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities 

  

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 159 fas 159 permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings fas 159 became effective for us on january 1 2008 we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our earnings or financial condition as we expect election of this option to be limited 

  

  

  

  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

of our total 9131 million of debt we had 4306 million of variable rate debt outstanding at december 31 2007 under our revolving lines of credit the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm interest rates risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates at our current level of borrowing a 1 increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately 43 million our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate debt and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense periodically we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2007 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2007 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations

our mission and strategy 

we forge longterm partnerships with key customers that include supplychain management as an integral part of their strategy working in concert we drive out cost add value and function as an extension of our customers’ enterprise we believe that our operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits and returns to stockholders 

recent focus 

during the past several years we have taken significant steps to reestablish a primary focus on the profitability of our three business segments in each segment we have implemented capacity management decision making processes that result in the deployment of our assets where we believe they will generate more profit we continually focus on replacing lessprofitable freight with highermargin freight and lanes selective pricing actions and ensuring that we properly charge for all services provided have also been areas of major focus 

in addition a continuing shortage of qualified drivers and fundamental changes in shipper supplychain transportation logistics have resulted in the conversion of freight from traditional random truckload to intermodal and dedicated operations we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and conduct all of our operations as safely as possible 

operating segments 

segment information is included in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

jbi segment 

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize arrangements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership with the former santa fe railway now the bnsf railway company a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment essentially jbi draws on the intermodal also known as “container on flatcar” services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries “drayage” for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations we may directly provide the drayage service at either the origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our companyowned tractors or we may purchase these services from third parties jbi provides seamless coordination of the rail and overtheroad transport movements for our customers and delivers a single billing for the complete doortodoor service 

our intermodal program has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to nearly 630000 in 2006 jbi operates 27622 companycontrolled containers systemwide the entire fleet comprises 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality jbi also manages a fleet of 1551 companyowned tractors and 1946 company drivers in support of intermodal operations we also began utilizing independent contractors ics in our intermodal segment during 2005 we had 23 ics operating in our jbi business segment at december 31 2006 at december 31 2006 the total jbi employee count was 2189 including the 1946 drivers revenue for the jbi segment in calendar year 2006 was 143 billion compared with 128 billion in 2005 as previously announced an arbitration process with the bnsf railway company bni was concluded during the third quarter of 2005 in accordance with the settlement terms we paid bni 258 million in the third quarter of 2005 in addition this settlement also resulted in higher rail purchase transportation expenses effective october 1 2005 normal commercial business activity continued with bni during the approximate 15month arbitration process and normal business operations have continued since the final settlement 

dcs segment 

since 1992 we have offered dedicated contract carriage as a service option dcs segment operations specialize in the design development and execution of customerspecific fleet solutions capitalizing on advanced systems and technologies dcs offers transportation engineering solutions that support private fleet conversion dedicated fleet creation and transportation system augmentation dcs operations typically provide customized services that are governed by longterm contracts and currently include dryvan flatbed temperaturecontrolled dump trailers and local innercity operations 

dcs operations focus on delivering recognizable customer value through bestinclass service cost control and guaranteed dedicated capacity dcs utilizes a proprietary methodology known as customer value delivery® cvd to create measure and communicate value generated for each customer dcs leverages the jbht freight network to reposition equipment near outbound domiciles thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost dcs also frequently finds synergy in shared resources with the jbt and jbi segments including terminals drivers maintenance shops bulk fuel locations and trailer pools providing further economies of scale dcs revenue for calendar year 2006 was 915 million compared with 844 million in 2005 in early 2004 we began utilizing ics in the dcs segment and at december 31 2006 we had 122 ics operating in the dcs segment at december 31 2006 the dcs segment operated 5177 companycontrolled and 59 customerowned tractors and employed 6242 people 5496 of whom were drivers 

jbt segment 

our primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment include fullload dryvan freight which is predominantly transported utilizing companycontrolled tractors operating over roads and highways we pick up our freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee most of our loads are transported entirely by our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or by independent contractors who agree to transport freight in our trailers we also assign freight to be handled by thirdparty motor carriers other than ics this type of freight movement typically results in our billing the customer for all applicable freight charges and in turn paying the third party for their portion of the transportation services provided this type of service usually results in our recognition of revenue for the entire billing and the payment to the thirdparty being classified as purchased transportation expense 

we operate under the approval of certain canadian authorities allowing us to transport freight to and from all points in the continental united states to quebec british columbia and ontario we have authorization to operate directly in substantially all the canadian provinces but to date we have served limited points in canada primarily through interchange operations with canadian motor carriers in late 2000 we began utilizing ics in the jbt segment and at december 31 2006 we had 962 ics operating in the jbt segment some of whom were leasing companycontrolled tractors jbt revenue for calendar year 2006 was 101 billion compared with 102 billion in 2005 at december 31 2006 the jbt 

segment operated 4232 companyowned tractors and employed 5916 people 4981 of whom were drivers a portion of our jbt segment nondriver employees provide freight solicitation order entry and other operational support services to our other two segments we record intersegment credits and charges to properly reflect these intersegment support services

effective july 1 2000 we contributed an existing logistics segment business to a newly formed company transplace inc tpi tpi provides supplemental logistics sales and management support and also has arrangements with approximately 2700 motor carriers to provide capacity to transport freight our share of tpi’s financial results is included on a oneline nonoperating item included on our consolidated statements of earnings entitled “equity in loss of associated company” 

operations in mexico we have provided transportation services to and from mexico since 1989 these services typically involve equipment interchange operations with various mexican motor carriers as previously reported we sold a joint venture interest with a mexican transportation company in 2002 we received all remaining funds due in connection with this sale during 2005 this transaction did not significantly impact our earnings we continue to provide transportation services to and from mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of mexican carriers 

marketing and operations 

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including forest and paper products building materials general merchandise food and beverages chemicals and automotive parts our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of fortune 500 companies our ability to offer multiple services utilizing our three business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties represents a competitive advantage we provide a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers our largest customer in 2006 was walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 14 of our total revenue 

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we do have some sales and marketing functions managed at the businessunit level particularly for our dcs segment in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided in recent years we have reestablished a primary focus on improving the profitability of each of our business segments and charging a fair price for all services provided 

people 

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 17150 employees including 12423 company drivers 1175 mechanics and 3548 office personnel we also had arrangements with 1107 ics to transport freight in our trailing equipment none of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

our industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough qualified truck drivers it is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100 it has been our practice during the past few years to compensate our drivers at an aboveaverage level in order to attract a higher caliber of experience and minimize turnover during 2006 and 2005 we increased company driver and ic compensation in order to attract and retain an adequate supply of qualified drivers while we have not to date experienced significant operational disruptions due to driver shortages we expect the costs to recruit train and retain company drivers and ics will continue to rise in the foreseeable future 

revenue equipment 

as of december 31 2006 we operated 10961 companyowned tractors in addition our 1107 ics operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbi and jbt fleets based on our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is more diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2006 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 22 years our trailers averaged 57 years of age and our containers averaged 65 years we perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars we are currently in the process of expanding our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans straight trucks and dump trailers we typically operate newer revenue equipment in our jbt segment to minimize downtime and maximize utilization 

effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa has mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines we are planning our new equipment purchases to accommodate these new standards but allow adequate testing of the new engines the 2007 epacompliant engines will be equipped with a particulate trap and will require more costly ultralowsulfur diesel ulsd fuel the epa estimates that ulsd fuel will cost approximately 04 to 05 more per gallon in 2006 we began testing the 2007 modelyear engines in a group of our tractors we are unable at this time to determine the increase in acquisition and operating costs of these new 2007 epacompliant engines 

competition and the industry 

the market in which we compete is frequently referred to as highly fragmented and includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country we compete with other freight transportation carriers primarily in terms of ontime pickup and delivery service availability of drivers and revenue equipment and price 

regulation 

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries 

effective october 1 2005 driver hoursofservice regulations hos were revised the majority of these rule changes had initially been effective january 4 2004 these collective changes were the most significant changes to driver hos in more than 40 years in general the new rules require a driver to take at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a tenhour offduty period these new rules primarily affect shorthaul and multiplestop freight operations and had a minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially 

and adversely affected by any of these risks also note that additional risks not currently identified or known to us could also negatively impact our business or financial results 

our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices excess capacity in the trucking industry interest rates fuel taxes license and registration fees insurance premiums selfinsurance levels interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads terrorist attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment surpluses in the market for used equipment and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for baddebt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

we operate in a competitive and somewhat fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

some of these factors include 

·   we compete with many other transportation carriers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with lessthantruckload carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do

·   some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins

·   many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected

·   many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors

·   certain of our customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations

·   the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size

·   advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

for the calendar year ended december 31 2006 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 40 of our revenue our largest customer is walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 14 of our total revenue in 2006 our jbt and jbi segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

our jbi business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railroad the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results we also utilize the services of a number of thirdparty dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and destination pickups and deliveries in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts 

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

periodically the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers including ics a shortage of qualified company drivers and ics has proven to be particularly severe during the past few years in spite of continued increases in driver compensation and recruiting costs the industry is currently experiencing a shortage of drivers if we are unable to continue attracting an adequate number of drivers or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings during 2005 we selfinsured a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage and health claims for amounts up to the first 2 million for auto accidents and 1 million for workers’ compensation during 2006 the selfinsured portion of our claims exposure for all claims was reduced to 500000 if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected the selfinsured portion of our claims will also be 500000 during 2007 we purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are selfinsured insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking companies as a result our insurance and claims expenses could increase when our current coverage expires if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain saleandleaseback transactions 

as previously disclosed the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain saleandleaseback transactions which we entered into in 1999 based on events occurring subsequent to december 31 2004 we established a reserve for a contingent tax liability of 336 million at december 31 2004 the liability for this contingency which includes estimated interest is included on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2006 as a longterm liability we have accrued approximately 30 million of interest expense during 2006 related to this contingency we 

continue to believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from our then external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into these transactions and we continue to vigorously defend against the irs position using all administrative and legal processes available if the irs were successful in disallowing 100 of the tax benefit from this transaction the total ultimate impact on liquidity could be approximately 44 million excluding interest 

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

effective october 1 2005 driver hos regulations were revised the majority of these rule changes had initially been effective january 4 2004 these collective changes were the most significant changes to driver hos in more than 40 years in general the new rules require a driver to take at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a 10hour offduty period these new rules primarily affect shorthaul and multiplestop freight operations and had a minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results 

effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa has mandated lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines we are planning our new equipment purchases to accommodate these new standards but also to allow adequate time for testing of the new engines in 2006 we began testing the 2007 modelyear engines in a group of our tractors we are unable to predict the impact these new standards will have on our future operations and business results 

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our thirdlargest general expense category during the past several years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly with prices at times changing as much as 020 to 025 per gallon between consecutive months we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2006 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

workers’ compensation and accident costs 

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions accidents and cargo claims most of our insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of 48 months from each policy period inception this contractual adjustment factor is used to convert the selfinsured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims in the fourth quarter of 2006 we increased the estimated accrual of our ultimate losses by 92 million to reflect the inclusion of these premium factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occurred rather than in the final year of the selfinsurance period see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates during 2006 we were selfinsured for 500000 of our claims for personal injury property damage and workers’ compensation for the two years ended december 31 2005 we were selfinsured for 2 million of our claims for personal injury and property damage and 1 million for workers’ compensation claims for 2007 we maintained our 500000 selfinsured coverage limit 

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2006 we had an accrual of approximately 20 million for estimated net claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2006 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 67 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums we are also substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

revenue equipment 

we operate a significant number of tractors trailers and containers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairments to our existing assets 

we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for tradein values it could have a material negative impact on our financial results we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december 31 2006 and 2005 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported accordingly a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments the allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments are based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility the adequacy of our allowances and reserves is reviewed quarterly 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the assetandliability method in accordance with current accounting standards our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared to when they are recognized in our tax returns we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe recovery is not probable a valuation allowance is established to the extent we establish a valuation allowance we include an expense as part of our income tax provision we have not recorded a valuation allowance at december 31 2006 as all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain taxrelated contingencies on our provision for income taxes we establish accruals when despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes based upon changing facts and circumstances a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved see note 6 income taxes in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 

year in review 

our financial results for calendar year 2006 represented the fifth consecutive year of record revenues and earnings our 2006 net earnings of 2200 million or 144 per diluted share were up 6 over the 2073 million or 128 per diluted share earned in 2005 fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during 2006 our 2006 fuel cost per gallon averaged 13 above 2005 levels however due to our fuel surcharge programs and the support and understanding of our customers we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 

freight demand during 2006 was relatively consistent for our intermodal and dedicated segments demand for dryvan truck capacity was softer particularly during the fourth quarter of 2006 comparisons of 2006 dryvan volumes to 2005 were negatively impacted by hurricane relief shipments in 2005 and lowerthanexpected seasonal demand during august through november of 2006 our intermodal and dedicated business units contributed to our higher level of profitability in 2006 while our truck segment experienced an approximate 27 decline in operating income as compared to 2005 partly in response to changing market conditions we increased the size of our intermodal and dedicated tractor fleets by 16 and 7 respectively and decreased our dryvan fleet by 6 we were able to effect some of these changes by merely transferring tractors among our fleets 

we also continued our focus on capacity management during 2006 capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight demand on a daily basis and our contractual relationships to determine which business application and segment generates the best returns we also continually analyze our business to ensure we are charging a fair price for all services that we provide in addition to our capacity management actions the continuing shortage of quality drivers and changes in the shipper supply chain resulted in the conversion of freight from overtheroad truck operations to intermodal and dedicated 

our 2006 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 888 compared with 890 in 2005 the current year was the third consecutive time that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 90 our 2006 operating income reflected a 124 million pretax charge to increase insurance reserves and 2005 results included a 258 million pretax arbitration charge we reinitiated paying a quarterly cash dividend in early 2004 and have increased our dividend to 006 in late 2004 008 in late 2005 and to 009 in january 2007 we have continued to purchase shares of our outstanding stock through 2006 during the current year we purchased 257 million of our common stock and at december 31 2006 we had 104 million authorized for future purchases 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

   

2006 compared with 2005 

consolidated operating revenues 

our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 333 billion in 2006 a 64 increase over 2005 significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of 430 million in 2006 compared with 336 million in 2005 this fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years the increase of 2006 revenue over 2005 was 38 this increased level of revenue excluding fsc was primarily a result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacitymanagement actions a 51 and 22 increase in 2006 jbi and dcs load volume respectively contributed to our higher levels of revenue the increases in revenue of our jbi and dcs segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet and a decline in tractor utilization 

consolidated operating expenses 

our total 2006 consolidated operating expenses increased 61 over 2005 the combination of the 64 increase in 2006 revenue over 2005 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our 2006 operating ratio improving slightly to 888 from 890 in 2005 rents and purchased transportation costs rose 63 in 2006 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies related to jbi growth the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 43 in 2006 over 2005 primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation 

fuel and fuel taxes expense was up 150 in 2006 primarily due to 126 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases partly due to empty miles run and engineidling time we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 

the 126 increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our trailing equipment purchases higher newtractor purchase prices and an approximate 5 increase in the size of our companyowned tractor fleet operating supplies and expenses rose 97 in 2006 partly a result of higher tractor maintenance tires and tolls costs a number of states have recently raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls the 277 decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects driver recruiting and testing costs legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding and charitable contributions in 2005 that declined or did not reoccur in 2006 also included in the general and administrative expense category we recognized a 29 million net gain on the disposition of assets in 2006 compared with a 18 million gain in 2005 the arbitration settlement expense incurred during 2005 was due to the bni arbitration decision discussed in the section on operating segments 

we accrued approximately 30 million of interest expense during 2006 related to an irs contingency our effective income tax rate was 379 in 2006 and 2005 we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 385 for calendar year 2007 but it may be impacted by the adoption of fin 48 we are currently assessing the impact of this pronouncement on our effective tax rate see the recent accounting pronouncements section for a discussion of fin 48 the “equity in loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 

segments 

we operated three business segments during calendar year 2006 the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue grew by 114 to 143 billion in 2006 from 128 billion in 2005 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 51 increase in load volume in addition freight rates increased nearly 4 over 2005 the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue 

operating income in our jbi segment rose to 182 million in 2006 from 124 million in 2005 the 258 million arbitration settlement charge incurred in september 2005 favorably impacted this comparison while this settlement also increased rail purchased transportation expense subsequent to october 1 2005 higher freight rates increased volumes and reduced use of rail control equipment increased 2006 operating income 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue grew 84 to 915 million in 2006 from 844 million in 2005 this increase in revenue was primarily due to a 22 increase in load volume an approximate 4 increase in rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue 

operating income increased to 104 million in 2006 compared with 100 million in 2005 similar to 2005 we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during 2006 generated appropriate financial returns we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue declined 12 to 101 billion in 2006 from 102 billion in 2005 this decline was primarily due to a 11 reduction in load volume while rates from consistent shippers increased approximately 2 during 2006 a decline in rates from spot and backup pricing and paid empty movements partly offset these increases 

operating income in our jbt segment declined to 87 million in 2006 from 119 million in 2005 the decrease was due in part to lower levels of tractor utilization and to higher driver compensation and insurance costs 

2005 compared with 2004 

overview of 2005 

our 2005 net earnings of 2073 million or 128 per diluted share were up 42 over the 1463 million or 088 per diluted share earned in 2004 our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 313 billion in 2005 a 123 increase over 2004 freight demand during the first half of 2005 was not as strong as the comparable period of 2004 but volume levels improved during the last half of 2005 our dcs and jbt segments contributed most significantly to our higher level of profitability in 2005 while increases in the size of the dcs and jbt tractor fleets accounted for a portion of the increases in operating income our continued focus on capacity management and revenue per tractor was the primary factor driving 2005 improved net earnings our 2005 net earnings were negatively impacted by the arbitration settlement as previously discussed 

jbi segment 

jbi segment revenue grew by 152 to 128 billion in 2005 from 112 billion in 2004 if fsc revenue were excluded from both years 2005 segment revenue increased 86 over 2004 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 50 increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc in addition 2005 load volume increased 29 over 2004 the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix 

operating income in our jbi segment declined to 124 million in 2005 from 131 million in 2004 as previously discussed the 258 million arbitration settlement paid to bni during the third quarter of 2005 reduced jbi operating income in addition this settlement also resulted in higher rail purchased transportation expense effective october 1 2005 these costs more than offset the impact of higher rates and volume in the segment 

dcs segment 

dcs segment revenue grew 111 to 844 million in 2005 from 760 million in 2004 the increase in fuel surcharge revenue in 2005 significantly impacted this comparison if we exclude fuel surcharge revenue from both years dcs segment revenue rose 63 over 2004 this increase in revenue resulted from a combination of a 25 increase in the average tractor count and a 53 increase in net revenue per tractor excluding fsc these increases were partly offset by a 14 decline in revenue related to freight delivered by thirdparty carriers the majority of these movements were billed by us to the customer in 2004 in 2005 a larger portion of these movements was billed directly to our customer by the thirdparty carrier 

operating income rose 34 to 100 million in 2005 compared with 75 million in 2004 similar to 2004 we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts identifying opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during 2005 generated appropriate financial returns we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate 

jbt segment 

jbt segment revenue was 102 billion in 2005 up 99 over the 928 million in 2004 higher fsc revenue in 2005 impacted this comparison if the amount of fsc revenue were excluded from both years 2005 jbt revenue rose 47 over 2004 the average tractor count in 2005 was essentially the same as 2004 however revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc was 60 above 2004 this higher level of revenue per loaded mile was offset by approximately 15 lower tractor utilization currentyear revenue growth was also up due to additional outsourced freight activity 

operating income of our jbt segment climbed to 119 million in 2005 from 103 million in 2004 the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement 

consolidated operating expenses 

our total 2005 consolidated operating expenses increased 124 over 2004 the combination of the 123 increase in 2005 revenue over 2004 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our 2005 operating ratio increasing slightly to 890 from 889 in 2004 rents and purchased transportation costs rose 135 in 2005 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies related to jbi growth the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 30 in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation 

fuel and fuel taxes expense was up 348 in 2005 primarily due to 33 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon it is difficult to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense the 89 increase in depreciation and amortization expense was partly a result of higher newtractor purchase prices and an approximate 3 increase in the size of our companyowned tractor fleet 

operating supplies and expenses rose 70 in 2005 partly a result of higher trailing equipment maintenance tires and tolls costs a number of states have recently raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls the significant increase in general and administrative expenses reflects higher driver recruiting and testing costs legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding and charitable contributions in october 2005 we announced a 10 million gift to the university of arkansas recorded at its net present value of approximately 56 million also included in the general and administrative expense category we recognized a 18 million net gain on the disposition of assets in 2005 compared with a 04 million gain in 2004 the arbitration settlement expense incurred during 2005 was due to the arbitration decision discussed earlier we accrued approximately 27 million of interest expense during 2005 related to an irs contingency our effective income tax rate was 379 in 2005 and 516 in 2004 income tax expense in 2004 included a contingent tax liability of 336 million including accrued interest related to the irs’s challenge of certain saleandleaseback transactions that closed in 1999 

the “equity in loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was 423 million in 2006 332 million in 2005 and 405 million in 2004 our continued improvement in net earnings has enhanced net cash from operations the increase in 2006 cash provided by operating activities relative to 2005 after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization was due to higher earnings collection of insurance reimbursements and a decrease in our insurance prepaid balance which is a result of lower insurance premiums the increase was partially offset by larger federal income tax refunds due us at december 31 2006 compared to income taxes payable at december 31 2005 

cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment the higher level of cash used in investing activities during 2006 was primarily a result of significant increases of trailing equipment purchases to replace older trailing equipment at december 31 2006 we had no revenue equipment on capital leases 

net cash used in financing activities during 2006 reflects the purchase of 257 million of our common stock and payment of dividends of nearly 48 million in 2006 our net cash used in financing activities decreased over 2005 due to an increase in borrowings on longterm debt and our credit revolvers funds were used primarily for stock purchases and the payment of dividends 

  

  

selected balance sheet data 

  

  

   

from time to time our board of directors authorizes the purchase of our common stock as previously mentioned the board in december 2004 authorized the purchase of up to 100 million of our common stock we made no purchases in 2004 and commenced purchases of our common stock in january 2005 on april 21 2005 our board authorized the purchase of an additional 500 million of our common stock over the next five years we purchased 257 million of our common stock in 2006 and 239 million in 2005 as of december 31 2006 we were authorized to spend an additional 104 million to purchase our common stock through 2010 

liquidity 

our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal trailing equipment trucks tractors and dryvan trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new latemodel equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have during the past few years obtained capital through cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit and most recently issued a term loan to acquire trailers that were previously leased we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment we had no capital lease arrangements at december 31 2006 to date none of our operating leases contains any guaranteed residual value clauses 

at december 31 2006 we were authorized to borrow up to a total of 400 million under two different revolving lines of credit the first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks for a total amount of 200 million this line of credit is unsecured and matures in april 2010 the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor depending upon the specific type of borrowing plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating at december 31 2006 we had 999 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 592 under this agreement 

our second line of credit is an accounts receivable securitization program through abn amro nv with a revolving credit facility up to 200 million this facility is secured by our accounts receivable and matures on july 30 2007 the applicable interest rate under this agreement is the prevailing a1p1 commercial paper rate in the market plus a margin based on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees at december 31 2006 we had 200 million outstanding at an average interest rate of 558 under this agreement we plan to renew this line of credit upon expiration with a oneyear term 

during 2006 we utilized a 200 million bridge loan with lasalle bank national association this loan was a temporary facility until our accounts receivable securitization was finalized an 829 million balance was paid off with the proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization during the third quarter this loan has been cancelled and we had no outstanding balance related to this facility at december 31 2006 

on september 29 2006 we purchased approximately 1015 million of used dryvan trailers off operating lease agreements in connection with the purchase of these trailers we entered into a term loan and credit agreement the “facility” arranged by sun trust bank this new 100 million facility is collateralized by a security interest in the trailing equipment this facility matures on september 29 2009 and our borrowing costs are based on threemonth libor plus an applicable margin on september 29 2006 we entered into an interest rate swap that effectively converts the variable rate to a fixed rate of 

585 we are required to make periodic minimum principal payments a 35 million principal payment was due and paid on december 29 2006 with additional 35 million principal payments due every three months thereafter through june 29 2009 this facility requires us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios we were in compliance with these covenants and financial ratios at december 31 2006 

we believe that our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock 

as mentioned above we had significant expenditures related to new trailing equipment for 2006 we are currently committed to spend approximately 1294 million during 2007 for trailers and other revenue equipment the actual cash expended will be net of proceeds from sale or tradein allowances on revenue equipment 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 10700 trailers and 1000 containerschassis that were subject to operating leases and we had approximately 40 million of obligations remaining under these leases 

contractual cash obligations 

as of december 31 2006 

000 

   

we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately 150 million at december 31 2006 that expire at various dates in fiscal year 2007 which are related to 1 our selfinsured retention levels for casualty and workers’ compensation claims and 2 our operating lease agreements we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our thirdparty agreements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

sharebased payments 

we may issue stock options and other stockbased awards to our key employees and directors under our management incentive plan the “plan” we currently are granting restricted share units and nonstatutory stock options prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for our stockbased employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of apb 25 as permitted by sfas 123 we did not record any stockbased employee compensation expense for options granted under our stock option plan prior to january 1 2006 we recognize the cost of the restricted share units over the applicable vesting period and as a result recorded approximately 05 million of compensation expense in 

connection with our restricted share unit issuances in 2005 in accordance with sfas 123 and sfas 148 prior to january 1 2006 we disclosed our pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share as if we had applied the fair valuebased method in measuring compensation expense for our stockbased incentive programs 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method under that transition method compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes i compensation expense for all stockbased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas 123 and ii compensation expense for all stockbased payments granted on or after january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123r because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method results for prior periods have not been restated the adoption of sfas 123r is discussed in note 5 of our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 while we continue to analyze and quantify the impact of this interpretation we estimate a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings of between 2 million and 9 million 

fair value measurements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements sfas 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently assessing the impact of sfas 157 on our consolidated financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 159 sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings sfas 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently assessing the impact of sfas 159 on our consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

of our total 3964 million of longterm debt we had 2999 million of variable rate debt outstanding at december 31 2006 under our revolving lines of credit the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm interest rates risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates at our current level of borrowing a 1 increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately 30 million our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate debt as a result of our interest rate swap and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense 

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from 

the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2006 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations

we officially began offering transportation logistics services in 1992 through a wholly owned subsidiary jb hunt logistics inc jbl jbl services frequently included an arrangement whereby a shipper might outsource a substantial portion of its entire distribution and transportation process to one organization the jbl segment business included a wide range of comprehensive transportation and management services including experienced professional managers information and optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of system solutions a new logistics customer or service arrangement frequently required a significant amount of upfront analysis and design time during which alternatives were considered and custom systems and software were developed effective july 1 2000 we contributed our existing jbl segment business to a newly formed company tpi tpi provides supplemental logistics sales and management support and also has arrangements with approximately 2800 motor carriers to provide capacity to transport freight our share of tpi’s financial results are included on a oneline nonoperating item included on our consolidated statements of earnings entitled “equity in loss of associated company” 

  

operations in mexico   we have provided transportation services to and from mexico since 1989 these services typically involve equipment interchange operations with various mexican motor carriers as previously reported we sold a joint venture interest with a mexican transportation company in 2002 we received all remaining funds due in connection with this sale during 2005 this transaction had no significant impact on our earnings we continue to provide transportation services to and from mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of mexican carriers 

  

marketing and operations 

  

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including forest and paper products building materials general merchandise food and beverages chemicals and automotive parts our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a large number of fortune 500 companies our ability to offer multiple services utilizing our three business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties represents a competitive advantage we provide a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers our largest customer in 2005 was walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 15 of our total revenue 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we do have some sales and marketing functions managed at the businessunit level particularly for our dcs segment in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided in recent years we have reestablished a primary focus on improving the profitability of each of our business segments and charging a fair price for all services provided 

  

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 16370 employees including 11758 company drivers we also had arrangements with 1310 ics to transport freight in our trailing equipment in addition we employed 1170 mechanics and 3439 office personnel at the end of 2005 none of our employees is represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

our industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough qualified truck drivers it is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100 it has been our practice during the past few years to compensate our drivers at an aboveaverage level in order to attract a higher caliber of experience and minimize turnover during 2005 we increased company driver and ic compensation in order to attract and retain an adequate supply of qualified drivers while we have not to date experienced significant operational disruptions due to driver shortages we expect 

  

  

the costs to recruit train and retain company drivers and ics will continue to rise in the foreseeable future 

  

revenue equipment 

  

as of december 31 2005 we operated 10480 companycontrolled tractors in addition our 1310 ics operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbt and jbi fleets based on our customers’ preferences and the actual business application our dcs fleet is more diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2005 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 22 years our trailers averaged 50 years of age and our containers averaged 68 years we perform routine servicing and preventative maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

  

we typically operate newer revenue equipment in our jbt segment to minimize downtime and maximize utilization our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars we are currently in the process of expanding our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans and even straight or dump trucks 

  

effective october 1 2002 the environmental protection agency epa required that most newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines comply with certain new emission standards we initially limited our new tractor purchases while we tested these new 2002 epacompliant engines at december 31 2005 we were operating approximately 5900 tractors with these 2002 rulecompliant engines these engines experience an approximate 4 to 5 lower fuel efficiency and are also expected to require higher annual maintenance costs 

  

effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa has mandated even lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines we once again are planning our new equipment purchases to accommodate these new standards but allow adequate testing of the new engines the 2007 epacompliant engines will be equipped with a particulate trap and will require more costly ultralowsulfur diesel ulsd fuel the epa estimates that ulsd fuel will cost approximately 04 to 05 more per gallon we are unable at this time to determine the increase in acquisition and operating costs of these new 2007 epacompliant engines 

  

competition and the industry 

  

according to the most recently available study conducted by the american trucking associations ata all modes of domestic freight carriers in the united states generated approximately 610 billion of revenue in 2003 of this total truck transportation represented about 87 or 531 billion ata also estimated that approximately 54 of the nation’s 2003 truck revenue related to forhire carriers while 46 related to private carriers as of july 2004 there were more than 573000 private forhire us mail and other us interstate motor carriers on file with the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa the top 10 forhire truckload carriers only generate about 3 of the total revenue in this segment and we represent approximately 1 of this segment’s revenue the market in which we compete is frequently referred to as highly fragmented and includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country we compete with other freight transportation carriers primarily in terms of ontime pickup and delivery service availability of drivers and revenue equipment and price 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and the federal motor carrier safety administration and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our 

  

  

compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries 

  

effective october 1 2005 driver hoursofservice regulations hos were revised the majority of these rule changes had initially been effective january 4 2004 these collective changes were the most significant changes to driver hos in more than 40 years in general the new rules require a driver to take at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a tenhour offduty period these new rules primarily affect shorthaul and multiplestop freight operations and had a minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the forwardlooking statements outlined previously in this form 10k and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business our business financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks also note that additional risks not currently identified or known to us could also negatively impact our business or financial results 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices excess capacity in the trucking industry surpluses in the market for used equipment interest rates fuel taxes license and registration fees insurance premiums selfinsurance levels and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for baddebt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

we operate in a competitive and somewhat fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

some of these factors include 

  

•   we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with lessthantruckload carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do

  

•   some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins

  

•   many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected

  

  

•   many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors

  

•   certain of our customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations

  

•   the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size

  

•   advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2005 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 40 of our revenue our largest customer is walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 15 of our total revenue in 2005 our jbt and jbi segments typically do not have longterm contracts with their customers while our dcs segment business may involve a written contract those contracts may contain cancellation clauses and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our intermodal business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railroad the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results we also utilize the services of a number of thirdparty dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and destination pickups and deliveries in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts 

  

difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

periodically the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers including ics a shortage of qualified company drivers and ics has proven to be particularly severe during the past few years in spite of continued increases in driver compensation and recruiting costs the industry is currently experiencing a significant shortage of drivers if we are unable to continue attracting an adequate number of drivers or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings during 2005 we selfinsured a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage and health claims for amounts up to the first 2 million for auto accidents and 1 million for workers’ compensation effective january 1 2006 the selfinsured portion of our claims exposure for personal injury and workers’ compensation was reduced to 500000 if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected also we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we selfinsure with licensed insurance companies insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking 

  

  

companies as a result our insurance and claims expenses could increase when some of our current coverages expire on july 31 2006 if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain saleandleaseback transactions 

  

as previously disclosed the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain saleandleaseback transactions which we entered into in 1999 based on events occurring subsequent to december 31 2004 we established a reserve for a contingent tax liability of 336 million at december 31 2004 the liability for this contingency which included estimated interest expense was included on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2004 as a longterm liability we accrued approximately 27 million of interest expense during 2005 related to this contingency we continue to believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from our then external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into these transactions and we continue to vigorously defend against the irs position using all administrative and legal processes available if the irs were successful in disallowing 100 of the tax benefit from this transaction the total ultimate impact on liquidity could be approximately 44 million excluding interest 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

  

we operate in a regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

  

effective october 1 2005 driver hos regulations were revised the majority of these rule changes had initially been effective january 4 2004 these collective changes were the most significant changes to driver hos in more than 40 years in general the new rules require a driver to take at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a 10hour offduty period these new rules primarily affect shorthaul and multiplestop freight operations and had a minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results 

  

effective october 1 2002 the epa required that most newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines comply with certain new emission standards at december 31 2005 we were operating approximately 5900 tractors with these 2002 rulecomplaint engines in addition to higher initial purchase prices these tractors have also experienced an average 4 to 5 reduction in fuel efficiency effective with modelyear 2007 tractors the epa has mandated even lower emission standards for newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines we are planning our new equipment purchases to 

  

  

accommodate these new standards but also to allow adequate time for testing of the new engines we are unable to predict the impact these new standards will have on our future operations and business results 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results 

  

fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our thirdlargest general expense category during the past several years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly with prices at times changing as much as 20 to 25 per gallon between consecutive months we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2005 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations

dividend policy 

  

we paid quarterly dividends during calendar year 1999 and in a number of years prior to 1999 in early 2000 we announced a decision to discontinue dividend payments in april 2004 we reinitiated a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share this reinitiation was based on our lower debt levels and improving cash flows we also paid a cash dividend of 015 per share in july and october 2004 in december 2004 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 015 to 06 our first 06 per share dividend was paid on february 18 2005 we paid a 06 per share dividend in april july and october 2005 in january 2006 we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 06 to 08 effective with our payment in february 2006 we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis however no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid since such payments are dependent on earnings cash flows and other factors

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 

  

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

we co n sider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs   we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims most insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates during 2005 we were selfinsured for essentially 2 million of our claims for personal injury and property damage and 1 million for workers’ compensation claims effective january 1 2006 the selfinsured portion of our claims exposure for personal injury property damage and workers’ compensation was reduced to 500000 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of lossdevelopment factors based on our historical claims experience in doing so the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2005 we had an accrual of approximately 16 million for estimated net claims in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2005 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 76 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums we are also substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

  

revenue equipment   we operate a significant number of tractors trailers and containers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straightline 

  

  

method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december 31 2005 

  

we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or tradein values for certain new equipment we have utilized these tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for depreciation expense if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for tradein values it could have a material negative impact on our financial results we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairments to our existing assets 

  

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported accordingly a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

year in review 

  

our financial results for calendar year 2005 represented the fourth consecutive year of record revenues and earnings driven by good to excellent performance from each of our segments our 2005 net earnings of 2073 million or 128 per diluted share were up 42 over the 1463 million or 88 per diluted share earned in 2004 fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during 2005 our 2005 fuel cost per gallon averaged 33 above 2004 levels however due to our fuel surcharge programs and the support and understanding of our customers we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 

  

freight demand during the first half of 2005 was not as strong as the comparable period of 2004 but volume levels improved during the last half of 2005 our dcs and jbt segments contributed most significantly to our higher level of profitability in 2005 while increases in the size of the dcs and jbt tractor fleets accounted for a portion of the increases in operating income our continued focus on capacity management and revenue per tractor was the primary factor driving 2005 improved net earnings capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight and individual dedicated arrangements to determine whether business that is generating low or negative margins can be replaced by different business with better margins we also continually analyze our business to ensure we are charging a fair price for all services that we provide primarily due to our capacitymanagement actions and rate increases which offset nonfuel cost increases our 2005 revenue per tractor excluding fuel surcharges increased 53 and 43 in our dcs and jbt segments respectively our jbi segment revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc also increased 50 in 2005 while these rate increases were the best our intermodal segment has experienced in several years we did start to incur higher railroad purchased transportation expense our jbi operating income was clearly reduced by the bni arbitration charge the third quarter 2005 arbitration charge of 258 million included 83 million that related to 2004 freight movements we also incurred significant legal fees in 2004 and 2005 associated with this arbitration process excluding the effects of the 83 million arbitration charge that related to 2004 freight movements our jbi segment would have reported an increase in 2005 operating income compared with the decrease of 5 

  

we continued our focus on safety during 2005 although our 2005 actual insurance and safety costs were slightly higher than 2004 we were able to duplicate the fine performance we saw in 2004 in terms of dot accidents per million miles and dot preventable accidents per million miles one significant result of our industryleading safety results over the past several years was the establishment of a multiyear 500000 deductible limit in our primary casualty and workers’ compensation insurance coverage this new deductible limit was effective january 1 2006 and compares with 2 million for casualty and 1 million for workers’ compensation in 2005 

  

  

our 2005 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 890 compared with 889 in 2004 and 924 in 2003 the current year was the second consecutive time in over 10 years that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 90 we reinitiated paying a quarterly cash dividend of 015 in early 2004 and increased our dividend to 06 in december 2004 and to 08 in december 2005 we also announced plans in december 2004 to repurchase up to 100 million of our common stock and announced an additional 500 million repurchase program in april 2005 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

  

2005 compared with 2004 

  

consolidated operating revenues 

  

our total consolidated operating revenues rose to 313 billion in 2005 a 123 increase over 2004 we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance and revenue growth requires that fuel surcharge fsc revenue which can fluctuate significantly between reporting periods be excluded when making revenue comparisons significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of 336 million in 2005 compared with 167 million in 2004 this fsc revenue impacted our yeartoyear comparison if fsc revenues were excluded from both years the increase of 2005 revenue over 2004 was 66 this increased level of revenue excluding fsc was primarily a result of rate increases our capacitymanagement actions and a small increase in the size of our tractor fleet jbt segment revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc in 2005 averaged 60 higher than 2004 while dcs’s revenue per tractor excluding fsc rose 53 in 2005 over 2004 a nearly 3 increase in 2005 jbi load volume also contributed to our higher levels of revenue 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

our total 2005 consolidated operating expenses increased 124 over 2004 the combination of the 123 increase in 2005 revenue over 2004 and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our 2005 operating ratio increasing slightly to 890 from 889 in 2004 the total cost of salaries wages and employee benefits increased 30 in 2005 over 2004 primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation rents and purchased transportation costs rose 135 in 2005 primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies related to jbi growth 

  

fuel and fuel taxes expense was up 348 in 2005 primarily due to 33 higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change it is difficult to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel tax expense or the change of fuel expense between periods as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads dray carriers and other third parties these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases partly due to empty miles run and engineidling time we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs the 89 increase in depreciation and amortization expense was partly a result of higher newtractor purchase prices and an approximately 3 increase in the size of our companyowned tractor fleet 

  

operating supplies and expenses rose 70 in 2005 partly a result of higher trailing equipment maintenance tires and tolls costs a number of states have recently raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls the significant increase in general and administrative expenses reflects higher driver recruiting and testing costs legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding and charitable contributions in october 2005 we announced a gift to the university of arkansas that represented approximately 56 million also included in the general and administrative expense category we recognized a 18 million net gain on the disposition of assets in 2005 compared with a 04 million gain in 2004 the arbitration settlement expense incurred during 2005 was due to the arbitration decision that was discussed earlier we accrued approximately 27 million of interest expense during 2005 related to an irs contingency our effective income tax rate was 379 in 2005 and 516 in 2004 income tax expense in 2004 included a contingent tax liability of 336 million including accrued interest related to the irs’s challenge of certain saleandleaseback transactions that closed in 1999 

  

we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate 390 for calendar year 2006

segments 

  

we operated three business segments during calendar year 2005 the operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote 11 the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue was 102 billion in 2005 up 99 over the 928 million in 2004 higher fsc revenue in 2005 impacted this comparison if the amount of fsc revenue were excluded from both years 2005 jbt revenue rose 47 over 2004 the average tractor count in 2005 was essentially the same as 2004 however revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc was 60 above 2004 this higher level of revenue per loaded mile was offset by approximately 15 lower tractor utilization currentyear revenue growth was also up due to additional outsourced freight activity 

  

  

operating income of our jbt segment climbed to 119 million in 2005 from 103 million in 2004 the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue grew by 152 to 128 billion in 2005 from 112 billion in 2004 if fsc revenue were excluded from both years 2005 segment revenue increased 86 over 2004 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 50 increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc in addition 2005 load volume increased 29 over 2004 the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix 

  

operating income in our jbi segment declined to 124 million in 2005 from 131 million in 2004 as previously described a 258 million arbitration settlement paid to bni during the third quarter of 2005 reduced jbi operating income in addition this settlement also resulted in higher rail purchased transportation expense effective october 1 2005 these costs more than offset the impact of higher rates and volume in the segment 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue grew 111 to 844 million in 2005 from 760 million in 2004 the increase in fuel surcharge revenue in 2005 significantly impacted this comparison if we exclude fuel surcharge revenue from both years dcs segment revenue rose 63 over 2004 this increase in revenue resulted from a combination of a 25 increase in the average tractor count and a 53 increase in net revenue per tractor excluding fsc these increases were partly offset by a 14 decline in revenue related to freight delivered by thirdparty carriers the majority of these movements were billed by us to the customer in 2004 in 2005 a larger portion of these movements were billed directly to our customer by the thirdparty carrier 

  

operating income rose 34 to 100 million in 2005 compared with 75 million in 2004 similar to 2004 we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts identifying opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during 2005 generated appropriate financial returns we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate these efforts have improved our dcs segment operating ratio to 881 in 2005 from 902 in 2004 

  

2004 compared with 2003 

  

overview of 2004 

  

our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2004 totaled a record 146 million this compares with our previous record net earnings of 95 million in 2003 diluted earnings per share were 88 in 2004 also a record number compared with 58 in 2003 the average number of diluted shares outstanding in 2004 was approximately 2 higher than the comparable number in 2003 consolidated operating revenues were 279 billion in 2004 an increase of 14 over the 243 billion in 2003 

  

each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in 2004 while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during 2004 a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings we continued our focus on capacity management as well as individual load and lane profitability a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers in addition the levels of available capacity in the industry were reduced by significant increases in insurance fuel equipment 

  

  

and driver compensation costs the availability of qualified drivers also limited carriers’ ability to expand the size of their fleets 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment revenue was 928 million in 2004 up 10 over the 841 million in 2003 higher fsc revenue in 2004 impacted this comparison if the amount of fsc revenue were excluded from both years 2004 jbt segment revenue rose 79 over 2003 the average tractor count in 2004 declined 31 from 2003 however revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc was 87 above 2003 offsetting the decrease in the tractor fleet and enhancing operating income 2004 revenue growth was also up approximately 2 from outsourced freight activity 

  

operating income of the jbt segment rose to 103 million in 2004 from 49 million in 2003 the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement in addition lower jbt accident and workers’ compensation costs positively impacted 2004 operating income 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment revenue grew by 19 to 112 billion in 2004 from 936 million in 2003 higher fsc revenue in 2004 impacted this comparison if fsc revenue were excluded from both years 2004 jbi segment revenue increased 158 over 2003 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 103 increase in loads revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc was 34 above 2003 levels the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of freight mix changes 

  

operating income in the jbi segment increased to 131 million in 2004 from 91 million in 2003 the increase in 2004 jbi operating income levels was partly a result of the higher revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc increased load volume and lower revenue equipment ownership costs partly offset by higher rail and dray purchased transportation expenses 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue grew over 13 to 760 million in 2004 from 671 million in 2003 the higher level of fsc revenue in 2004 impacted this comparison if fsc revenue were excluded from both years 2004 dcs segment revenue rose 10 over 2003 the average number of trucks in the dedicated fleet increased nearly 5 in 2004 the additional revenue growth in 2004 was primarily a result of a 6 increase in net revenue per tractor 

  

operating income increased 65 to 75 million in 2004 versus 45 million in 2003 during 2004 we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets we also implemented cost controls and raised rates as appropriate these efforts improved our dcs segment operating ratio to 902 in 2004 from 933 in 2003 

  

consolidated operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 102 in 2004 over 2003 while operating revenues increased 145 the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by 350 basis points to 889 in 2004 from 924 in 2003 as previously mentioned increases in revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc and lower casualty and workers’ compensation claims costs were two of the more significant factors driving these changes we also increased the number of ics in our jbt and dcs fleets to 1301 at december 31 2004 from 994 at the end of 2003 when we replace companyoperated tractors and driver employees with ics certain costs such as salaries wages employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 

  

the expense category of salaries wages and employee benefits declined to 298 of revenue in 2004 from 325 in 2003 and the total expense dollars only increased 48 from 2003 compared with 

  

  

the 145 increase in revenue while we did increase compensation levels for many of our drivers in 2004 these increases were partly offset by lower workers’ compensation costs the number of company drivers at december 31 2004 was approximately equal to the number at the end of 2003 the 166 increase in rents and purchased transportation was primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies related to jbi business growth and to the continued expansion of our ic fleets 

  

fuel cost per gallon was approximately 21 higher in 2004 over 2003 this increase in fuel costs and slightly lower fuel efficiency accounted for the 242 increase in fuel costs we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change if fuel costs change rapidly we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods we were able to recover substantially all of our increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year 2004 we have no contract or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs 

  

the decline in insurance and claims expense was primarily due to lower accident and claims experience in 2004 as mentioned above we have continued to focus on safety throughout our entire organization the category of general and administrative expenses includes driver recruiting and testing legal and professional fees and bad debt expense gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category we experienced a net gain of approximately 402000 on revenue equipment and other dispositions in 2004 compared with a 11 million loss in 2003 

  

our net interest expense declined to 55 million in 2004 from 172 million in 2003 we continued to reduce our debt and capitalized lease obligations during 2004 and paid off all our remaining balance sheet debt and capital leases as of december 31 2004 our continued improvement in net earnings and strong cash flow allowed us to pay off this debt our effective income tax rate was 516 in 2004 compared with 431 in 2003 income tax expense in 2004 reflects a contingent tax liability of 336 million including accrued interest expense related to certain saleandleaseback transactions that closed in 1999 income tax expense in 2003 reflected the reversal of 77 million of noncash tax benefits taken in early 2003 related to these saleandleaseback transactions see risk factors for additional information on this matter our 2004 and 2003 income tax rates are also higher than statutory federal and state rates primarily due to our driver per diem plan this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company however it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rates 

  

the “equity in loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace inc tpi effective january 1 2003 we increased our interest in tpi to approximately 37 from 27 in 2002 jbht’s financial exposure is limited to its approximate 53 million investment in tpi since we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi’s financial obligations 

  

liquidity and capital resources   we generate significant amounts of cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 332 million in 2005 405 million in 2004 and 333 million in 2003 our continued improvement in net earnings from 2003 to 2005 has enhanced net cash from operations the decline in 2005 cash provided by operating activities was partly due to larger federal income tax payments and an increase in accounts receivable net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was reduced relative to 2004 by the change in deferred income taxes which in turn was a result of reduced tax depreciation expense the 2005 use of cash for trade accounts payable was partly due to timing differences of payments for insurance premiums cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment the higher level of cash used in investing activities during 2004 was a result of delayed tractor purchases in early 2003 while we were testing the new epacompliant engines and our decision in late 2003 to commence purchasing tractors that were under capital lease arrangements we paid 608 million in 2004 to 

  

  

purchase tractors that were previously under capital lease programs at december 31 2005 we had no revenue equipment on capital leases 

  

net cash used in financing activities during 2005 reflects the repurchase of 239 million of our common stock we utilized cash to pay down debt and to purchase revenue equipment off capital leases in 2003 and 2004 we borrowed 124 million during 2005 primarily to fund stock repurchases and the payment of dividends 

  

selected balance sheet data 

  

   

from time to time our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the years 2002 through 2004 as previously mentioned the board in december 2004 authorized the purchase of up to 100 million of our common stock during the next year we commenced repurchases of our common stock in january 2005 on april 21 2005 our board authorized the purchase of an additional 500 million of our common stock over the next five years 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older revenue equipment with new latemodel equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have during the past few years obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 

  

since late 2001 we have been acquiring tractors and trailing equipment primarily under purchase and operating lease arrangements and we anticipate purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future we are currently committed to spend approximately 277 million net of expected proceeds from sale or tradein allowances on revenue equipment and acquisition of new facilities and property in 2006 

  

we are authorized to borrow up to 200 million under our current revolving line of credit which expires in april 2010 at december 31 2005 we had a 124 million balance outstanding under that agreement while we do anticipate some need to borrow additional amounts on our revolver during 2006 we believe that our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future our revolving line of credit does not contain “ratings triggers” that would accelerate payments or amounts due under the agreement 

  

we have spent approximately 239 million on stock repurchases during calendar year 2005 we have authorization to spend an additional 361 million to repurchase our common stock through 2010 

  

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have no capitalized lease arrangements at december 31 2005 our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 20100 trailers and 5900 containerschassis that were subject to operating leases and we had approximately 112 million of obligations remaining under these leases

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payments sfas no 123r is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation and supersedes apb 25 among other items sfas no 123r eliminated the use of apb 25 and the intrinsicvalue method of accounting and requires companies to recognize in their financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options based on the grant date fair value of those awards in accordance with sfas no 123r the cost will be based on the fair value at the grant date of the award and will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the adoption of sfas no 123r requires us to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of outstanding sharebased payments this expense must be based on the fair value of the award on the grant date it will also require the benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required we will adopt sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 upon adoption we will 

  

  

use the modified prospective method and therefore will not restate our priorperiod results sfas no 123r will apply to new sharebased awards and to unvested stock options outstanding on the effective date based on our current understanding of sfas no 123r we believe this new accounting standard will reduce our calendar year 2006 net earnings by between three and four cents per share while this estimate represents the financial impact of sharedbased payments outstanding at december 31 2005 we are unable to predict the impact of any sharebased payments granted subsequent to december 31 2005 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we had 124 million of debt outstanding at december 31 2005 under our revolving line of credit the interest rate applicable to this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor our earnings would be affected by changes in these shortterm interest rates risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a nearterm adverse increase in shortterm interest rates at our current level of borrowing a one percent increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by 12 million we have no interest rate derivatives in place at december 31 2005 to mitigate this risk 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2005 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations

business strategy 

  

we seek to add value to each of our customer’s supply chain by providing superior service at competitive rates while controlling or minimizing our customers’ costs through network density transportation mode conversion and dedicated fleets we believe that our operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits and returns to stockholders 

  

recent focus 

  

during the past four years we have taken significant steps to reestablish a primary focus on the profitability of our three business segments in each segment we have implemented capacity management decisionmaking processes that result in the deployment of our assets where we believe they will generate more profit we continually seek to replace lessprofitable freight with highermargin freight and lanes selective pricing actions and ensuring that we properly charge for all services provided have also been areas of major focus we have also worked to ingrain safety into our corporate culture which has reduced our accident and injury costs during 2003 and 2004 

  

jbt segment 

  

our primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment include full truckload dryvan freight which is predominantly transported utilizing companycontrolled tractors we pick up our freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee most of our loads are transported entirely by our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or by independent contractors ics who agree to transport freight in our trailers we also assign freight to be handled by thirdparty motor carriers other than ics typically in these cases the charges for the entire movement are billed to the customer by us and we in turn pay the third party for their portion of the transportation services provided 

  

we operate utilizing certain canadian authorities allowing us to transport freight to and from all points in the continental united states to quebec british columbia and ontario we have authorization to operate directly in all the canadian provinces but to date we have served limited points in canada primarily through interchange operations with canadian motor carriers we operated our jbt and jbi segments in combined fashion in periods prior to january 1 2000 this combined operation was reported as vanintermodal “van” in prior periods in late 2000 we began utilizing ics in the jbt segment and at december 31 2004 we had 1113 ics operating in the jbt segment jbt gross revenue for calendar year 2004 was 928 million compared with 841 million in 2003 at december 31 2004 the jbt segment operated 4280 companycontrolled tractors and employed 5846 people 4866 of whom were drivers 

  

jbi segment 

  

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize agreements with most major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership with the former santa fe railway now the burlington northern santa fe a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment essentially jbi draws on the intermodal also known as “container on flatcar” services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries “drayage” for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations we may directly provide the drayage service at either the origin or destination rail ramp utilizing our companycontrolled tractors or we purchase these services from third parties jbi provides 

  

  

seamless coordination of the rail and overtheroad transport movements for our customers and delivers single billing for the complete doortodoor service

  

our intermodal program has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to nearly 582000 in 2004 jbi operates more than 22000 companycontrolled containers system wide the entire fleet is comprised of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality jbi also manages a fleet of 1192 tractors and 1535 drivers in support of intermodal operations at december 31 2004 the total jbi employee count was 1759 including 1535 drivers gross revenue for the jbi segment in calendar year 2004 was 112 billion compared with 936 million in 2003 as we have previously reported we are engaged in an arbitration process with burlington northern santa fe railroad to clarify certain terms of our joint service agreement see “risk factors” in item 7 of this form 10k 

  

dcs segment 

  

since 1992 we have offered dedicated contract carriage as a service option dcs segment operations specialize in the design development and execution of customer specific fleet solutions capitalizing on advanced systems and technologies dcs offers transportation engineering solutions that support private fleet conversion dedicated fleet creation and transportation system augmentation dcs operations typically provide customized services that are governed by longterm contracts and currently include dryvan flatbed temperaturecontrolled and local operations 

  

dcs operations focus on reducing costs and enhancing customer value through leveraging the jbht network for backhaul repositioning freight network freight may be used to reposition equipment near outbound domiciles thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost dcs also frequently finds synergy in shared resources with the jbt and jbi segments including terminals drivers maintenance shops bulk fuel locations and trailer pools providing further economies of scale dcs gross revenue for calendar year 2004 was 760 million compared with 671 million in 2003 in early 2004 we began utilizing ics in the dcs segment and at december 31 2004 we had 188 ics operating in the dcs segment at december 31 2004 the dcs segment operated 4679 companycontrolled and 178 customerowned tractors and employed 5733 people 5082 of whom were drivers 

  

logistics business and associated company 

  

we officially began offering transportation logistics services in 1992 through a wholly owned subsidiary jb hunt logistics jbl jbl services frequently included an arrangement whereby a shipper might outsource a substantial portion of its entire distribution and transportation process to one organization the jbl segment business included a wide range of comprehensive transportation and management services including experienced professional managers information and optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of system solutions a new logistics customer or service arrangement frequently required a significant amount of upfront analysis and design time during which alternatives were considered and custom systems and software were developed effective july 1 2000 we contributed substantially all of our jbl segment business all related intangible assets and 5 million of cash to a newly formed company transplace inc tpi 

  

tpi is an internetbased global transportation logistics company tpi commenced operations in july 2000 and initially included substantially all of the logistics business of jbht covenant transport inc swift transportation co inc us xpress enterprises inc and werner enterprises inc tpi gross revenue for calendar year 2004 was 705 million compared with 655 million in 2003 we initially had an approximate 27 ownership interest in tpi in november 2002 we agreed to purchase a portion of werner enterprises inc’s werner ownership interest in tpi effective january 1 2003 our interest in tpi increased from 27 to 37 and werner’s interest declined from 15 to 5 the financial results of tpi are included on a oneline nonoperating item included on our consolidated statements of earnings entitled “equity in loss of associated companies” 

  

  

operations in mexico   we have provided transportation services to and from mexico since 1989 these services frequently involve equipment interchange operations with various mexican motor carriers in addition a joint venture agreement with transportacion maritima mexicana tmm one of the largest transportation companies in mexico was signed in 1992 the joint venture comercializadora internacional de carga sa de cv and its subsidiaries originated and completed northbound and southbound international truck movements between the united states and mexico the joint venture also provided mexican domestic irregular route truck service refrigerated freight services mexican dedicated contract business and shorthaul drayage to and from the mexican maritime ports and rail heads 

  

as previously reported we sold our joint venture interest in mexico to tmm during the first quarter of 2002 in exchange for 225 million including a 181 million note receivable we have received approximately 180 million of principal and interest related to this note at december 31 2004 we have a 17 million account receivable from tmm and expect to receive these remaining funds during the first quarter of 2005 these transactions have had no net impact on our earnings we still provide transportation services to and from mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of mexican carriers 

  

marketing and operations 

  

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including forest and paper products building materials general merchandise food and beverages chemicals and automotive parts our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a growing list of fortune 500 companies our ability to offer multiple services utilizing our three business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties represents a competitive advantage we have been reasonably successful providing a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers our largest customer in 2004 was walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 15 of our total revenue 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we do have some sales and marketing functions managed at the business unit level particularly for our dcs segment in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided in recent years we have reestablished a primary focus on improving the profitability of each of our business segments and charging a fair price for all services provided 

  

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 15850 employees including 11483 company drivers we also had arrangements with 1301 ics to transport freight in our trailing equipment in addition we employed 1072 mechanics and 3295 office personnel at the end of 2004 none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

our industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough qualified truck drivers it is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100 it has been our practice during the past few years to compensate our drivers at an aboveaverage level in order to attract a high caliber of experience and minimize turnover during 2004 we increased company driver and ic compensation in order to attract and retain an adequate supply of qualified drivers while we have to date not experienced significant operational disruptions due to driver shortages we expect costs to recruit train and retain company drivers and ics will continue to rise in the foreseeable future 

  

  

revenue equipment 

  

as of december 31 2004 we operated 10151 companycontrolled tractors in addition our 1301 contracted ics operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbt and jbi fleets based on customer preference and the actual business application our dcs fleet is more diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2004 the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 20 years our trailers were 41 years old and our containers were 64 years old we perform routine servicing and preventative maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

  

we typically operate newer revenue equipment in our jbt segment to minimize downtime and maximize utilization however during 2003 the age of our jbt tractor fleet increased primarily due to our decision to delay trades our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars we are currently in the process of expanding our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dryvans flatbeds temperaturecontrolled curtainside vans or even straight trucks 

  

effective october 1 2002 the environmental protection agency epa required that most newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines comply with certain new emission standards in november 2002 we ordered approximately 2100 new tractors primarily for our jbi and dcs fleets which were equipped with mercedes engines these engines were exempt from the epa’s october 1 2002 rules except for these new tractors which were utilized primarily for local and regional operations we limited our new tractor purchases while we tested a limited number of the new engines in late 2003 we commenced receiving new tractors with the 2002 epacompliant engines at december 31 2004 approximately 4870 of our companycontrolled fleet consisted of tractors with these compliant engines in addition to higher initial purchase prices these tractors also experience an approximate 3 to 5 reduction in fuel efficiency we are uncertain if future maintenance costs will be higher on the average for these tractors as they age we do anticipate continued increases in tractor ownership costs and fuel costs as regular replacements and additions increase the percentage of our fleet with these newer engines in addition higher worldwide steel prices have resulted in increased acquisition costs for new revenue equipment a new set of proposed fuelemission standards mandated by the epa is expected to become effective in 2007 we are unable to predict the impact these proposed standards will have on our future operations and financial results 

  

competition 

  

according to the american trucking associations ata all modes of domestic freight carriers in the united states generated approximately 610 billion of revenue in 2003 of this total truck transportation represented about 87 or 531 billion ata also estimated that approximately 54 of the nation’s 2003 truck revenue related to forhire carriers while 46 related to private carriers as of july 2004 there were more than 573000 private forhire us mail and other us interstate motor carriers on file with the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa the top ten forhire truckload carriers only generate about 3 of the total revenue in this segment and we represent approximately 1 of this segment’s revenue the market in which we compete is frequently referred to as highly fragmented and includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries 

  

  

effective january 4 2004 the fmcsa which is a separate administration within the dot changed the regulations that govern driver hours of service these new rules were the most significant changes to driver hours of service in more than 40 years in general the new rules allow a driver to drive for up to 11 consecutive hours instead of 10 but require 10 hours of offduty time rather than 8 and reduce the total number of driving hours to 14 in a 24hour period compared to 15 under the old rules in addition more offduty “sleeper berth” time is required before onduty time is allowed in july 2004 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia rejected the new hoursofservice hos rules which had been newly effective in january 2004 the court’s rejection was based on concerns regarding driver’s health as well as other issues such as driving time rest periods and monitoring compliance in september 2004 the current hos rules were extended for one year or the time at which fmcsa develops a set of new rules in february 2005 the bush administration proposed legislation that would convert the current hos regulations into statutory law a move that would keep the current rules in effect despite the court of appeals action to overturn them we cannot predict the final resolution of this rules action however if the current hos rules remain in effect we do not anticipate a significant adverse effect on our operations or earnings

the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item 8 this discussion contains forwardlooking statements please see “forwardlooking statements” and “risk factors” for a discussion of items uncertainties assumptions and risks associated with these statements 

  

year in review 

  

our financial results for calendar year 2004 represented the third consecutive year of record revenues and earnings driven by strong performance from each of our segments our 2004 net earnings of 1463 million or 175 per diluted share were up 53 over the 954 million or 117 per diluted share earned in 2003 while each of our three business segments contributed to our higher levels of profitability the increase in operating income in the jbt segment was most evident a significant part of the increased jbt operating income in 2004 was a result of our continued focus on capacity management capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight to determine whether business which is generating low or negative margins can be replaced by different business with better margins we also are continuing to analyze our business to ensure we are charging for all services provided primarily due to our capacity management actions and rate increases required to offset certain nonfuel cost increases our 2004 jbt segment revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges fsc rose 87 over 2003 

  

during 2004 we also focused on revenue per load revenue per mile and revenue per tractor per day in our jbi and dcs business segments primarily due to our focus on rate increases and capacity management we were able to increase 2004 revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc by 34 in our jbi segment and net revenue per tractor per week by 60 in our dcs segment these increases significantly contributed to our higher net earnings in 2004 

  

our increase in consolidated 2004 net earnings was also a result of significantly lower insurance claims and workers’ compensation costs we have continued to ingrain safety into our company culture and ask each of our drivers and other employees to make safety a daily priority our 2004 combined insurance claims and workers’ compensation expense declined approximately 23 million from 2003 and increased our current year earnings per diluted share by approximately 13 

  

our 2004 consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was 889 compared with 924 in 2003 and 955 in 2002 the current year was the first time in over ten years that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 90 we also paid off all of our remaining balance sheet debt and capital lease obligations in 2004 we reinitiated paying a quarterly cash dividend in early 2004 and in december 2004 increased our quarterly dividend from 03 to 12 per share and announced plans to repurchase up to 100 million of our common stock 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

  

we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs   we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims most insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates during 2004 we were selfinsured for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first 2 million for auto accidents and 1 million for workers’ compensation claims these same levels of selfinsurance are in effect for 2005 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience in doing so the recorded ultimate liability considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses at december 31 2004 we had approximately 19 million of estimated net claims payable in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2004 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 58 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums we are also substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 

  

revenue equipment   we operate a significant number of tractors trailers and containers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straightline method over the lease term or the estimated useful life whichever is shorter we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december 31 2004 

  

we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or tradein values for certain new equipment acquired since 1999 during the fourth quarter of 2003 we reviewed the useful lives and salvage values of our tractor fleet we have utilized the guaranteed tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for purchased and leased tractors if our tractor supplier was unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for guaranteed tradein values it could have a materially negative impact on our financial results we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our longlived assets for impairment we have not identified any impairments to our existing assets 

  

revenue recognition   we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported accordingly a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting 

  

  

period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period

  

segments 

  

we operated three segments during calendar year 2004 the operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote 11 the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

results of operations   2004 compared with 2003 

  

overview of 2004 

  

our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2004 totaled a record 146 million this compares with our previous record net earnings of 95 million in 2003 diluted earnings per share were 175 in 2004 also a record number compared with 117 in 2003 the average number of diluted shares outstanding in 2004 was approximately 2 higher than the comparable number in 2003 consolidated operating revenues were 279 billion in 2004 an increase of 14 over the 243 billion in 2003 

  

  

each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in 2004 while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during 2004 a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings we have continued our focus on capacity management as well as individual load and lane profitability a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus have allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers in addition the levels of available capacity in the industry have been reduced by significant increases in insurance fuel equipment and driver compensation costs the availability of qualified drivers has also limited carriers’ ability to expand the size of their fleets 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment gross revenue was 928 million in 2004 up 10 over the 841 million in 2003 higher fuel surcharge fsc revenue in 2004 impacted this comparison if the amount of fsc revenue was excluded from both years 2004 jbt segment revenue rose 79 over 2003 the average tractor count in 2004 declined 31 from 2003 however revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc was 87 above 2003 offsetting the decrease in the tractor fleet and enhancing operating income current year revenue growth was also up approximately 2 from outsourced freight activity 

  

operating income of the jbt segment rose to 103 million in 2004 from 49 million in 2003 the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement in addition lower jbt accident and workers’ compensation costs positively impacted current year operating income 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment gross revenue grew by 19 to 1115 million in 2004 from 936 million in 2003 higher fsc revenue in 2004 impacted this comparison if fsc revenue was excluded from both years 2004 jbi segment revenue increased 158 over 2003 a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a 103 increase in loads revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc was 34 above 2003 levels the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of freight mix changes 

  

operating income in the jbi segment increased to 131 million in 2004 from 91 million in 2003 the increase in current year jbi operating income levels was partly a result of the higher revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc increased load volume and lower revenue equipment ownership costs partly offset by higher rail and dray purchased transportation expenses 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue grew over 13 to 760 million in 2004 from 671 in 2003 the higher level of fsc revenue in 2004 impacted this comparison if fsc revenue was excluded from both years 2004 dcs segment revenue rose 10 over 2003 the average number of trucks in the dedicated fleet increased nearly 5 in 2004 the additional revenue growth in the current year was primarily a result of a 6 increase in net revenue per tractor 

  

operating income increased 65 to 75 million in 2004 versus 45 million in 2003 during 2004 we have conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets we have also implemented cost controls and raised rates as appropriate these efforts have improved our dcs segment operating ratio to 902 in 2004 from 933 in 2003 

  

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

consolidated operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 102 in 2004 over 2003 while operating revenues increased 145 the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by 350 basis points to 889 in 2004 from 924 in 2003 as previously mentioned increases in revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges and lower casualty and workers’ compensation claims costs were two of the more significant factors driving these changes we also increased the number of ics in our jbt and dcs fleets to 1301 at december 31 2004 from 994 at the end of 2003 when we replace companyoperated tractors and driver employees with ics certain costs such as salaries wages employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 

  

the expense category of salaries wages and employee benefits declined to 298 of revenue in 2004 from 325 in 2003 and the total expense dollars only increased 48 from 2003 compared with the 145 increase in revenue while we did increase compensation levels for many of our drivers in 2004 these increases were partly offset by lower workers’ compensation costs the number of company drivers at december 31 2004 was approximately equal to the number at the end of 2003 the 166 increase in rents and purchased transportation was primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies related to jbi business growth and to the continued expansion of our ic fleets 

  

fuel cost per gallon was approximately 21 higher in 2004 over 2003 this increase in fuel costs and slightly lower fuel efficiency accounted for the 242 increase in fuel costs we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change if fuel costs change rapidly we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods we were able to recover substantially all of our increased fuel costs experienced in 

  

  

calendar year 2004 we currently have no contract or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs

  

the significant decline in insurance and claims expense was primarily due to lower accident and claims experience in 2004 as mentioned above we have made safety a primary focus item throughout our entire organization the category of general and administrative expenses includes driver recruiting and testing legal and professional fees and bad debt expense gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category we experienced a net gain of approximately 402000 on revenue equipment and other dispositions in 2004 compared with a 11 million loss in 2003 

  

our net interest expense declined to 55 million in 2004 from 172 million in 2003 we were able to continue reducing our debt and capitalized lease obligations during 2004 and paid off all our remaining balance sheet debt and capital leases as of december 31 2004 our continued improvement in net earnings and strong cash flow allowed us to pay off this debt our effective income tax rate was 516 in 2004 compared with 431 in 2003 income tax expense in 2004 reflects a contingent tax liability of 336 million including accrued interest expense related to certain saleleaseback transactions that closed in 1999 income tax expense in 2003 reflected the reversal of 77 million of noncash tax benefits taken in early 2003 related to these saleleaseback transactions see risk factors for additional information on this matter our 2004 and 2003 income tax rates are also higher than statutory federal and state rates primarily due to our driver per diem plan this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company however it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rates 

  

we expect our effective income tax rate to be 385 for the calendar year 2005 

  

the “equity in loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace inc tpi effective january 1 2003 we increased our interest in tpi to approximately 37 from 27 in 2002 jbht’s financial exposure is limited to its approximate 53 million investment in tpi since we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi’s financial obligations 

  

2003 compared with 2002 

  

overview of 2003 

  

our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2003 totaled 95 million after reversing 77 million of noncash tax benefits which resulted from a saleandleaseback transaction on intermodal trailing equipment this compares with our previous record net earnings of 52 million in 2002 diluted earnings per share were 117 in 2003 also a record number compared with 066 in 2002 the average number of diluted shares outstanding in 2003 was approximately 5 higher than the comparable number in 2002 consolidated operating revenues were 243 billion in 2003 an increase of 8 over the 225 billion in 2002 

  

each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in 2003 while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during 2003 a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings we continued our focus on capacity management as well as individual load and lane profitability a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers in addition significant increases in certain operating costs such as insurance fuel and equipment reduced the level of capacity available in the industry 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment gross revenue was 841 million in 2003 up 2 over the 827 million in 2002 higher fuel prices in 2003 and the resulting increase in fuel surcharge revenue accounted for this entire level of revenue growth the average tractor count in 2003 was down nearly 3 from 2002 however revenue per loaded mile 

  

  

excluding fuel surcharges rose 52 in 2003 more than offsetting the decline in the size of the fleet and enhancing operating income

  

operating income of the jbt segment rose to 49 million in 2003 from 27 million in 2002 in addition to the higher revenue per mile we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement plan driver per diem plan in early 2003 this new plan benefited most of our eligible drivers and increased operating income 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment gross revenue grew by 16 to 936 million in 2003 from 809 million in 2002 revenue growth was due in part to a strong demand for our unique intermodal service offering which generated an 11 increase in number of loads year over year freight mix changes also played an important role that led to improved revenue per load 

  

operating income in the jbi segment increased to 91 million in 2003 from 55 million in 2002 the jbi segment operating ratio improved by 300 basis points to 903 for 2003 compared to 933 for 2002 these improved financial results were attributable to our investment in upgrading our tractor fleet and adding incremental containers improved utilization of both drivers and equipment and a concentrated focus on yield management and revenue quality 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue grew approximately 7 to 671 million in 2003 from 628 in 2002 revenue net of purchased transportation and fuel surcharge revenue increased 5 the increase in revenue occurred even as the business unit’s average tractor count for 2003 declined approximately 1 compared to 2002 more than offsetting the decline in the tractor fleet was a nearly 6 improvement in revenue excluding fuel surcharge per tractor per day driving this increase in productivity was an increase in length of haul of 7 and increased focus on backhaul opportunities 

  

operating income increased 130 to 45 million in 2003 versus 20 million in 2002 at the end of 2002 we began analyzing a number of underperforming accounts and identified opportunities to redeploy assets from accounts that did not offer appropriate financial returns on the segment’s assets at the same time cost controls were implemented to improve operating results at all accounts the success of these efforts improved the operating ratio by 360 basis points to 933 in 2003 cost reductions in driver pay salary and office wages and associated payroll taxes also enhanced 2003 operating income a decline of 16 in the average age of the tractor fleet helped reduce maintenance costs and an ongoing commitment to safety contributed to an improvement in the segment’s insurance and claims costs we also incurred certain new startup costs in 2002 associated with several large accounts that did not impact 2003 revenue growth will continue to be driven by improvement in productivity and new customer opportunities that provide appropriate financial returns to justify commitment of additional assets 

  

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

consolidated operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 47 in 2003 over 2002 while operating revenues increased 83 the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by 310 basis points to 924 in 2003 from 955 in 2002 as previously mentioned increases in revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges and the implementation of a driver perdiem plan were two of the more significant factors driving these changes we also increased the number of independent contractors ics in our jbt fleet to 994 at december 31 2003 from 679 at the end of 2002 when we replace companyoperated tractors and driver employees with ics certain costs such as salaries wages employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 

  

fuel cost per gallon was approximately 13 higher in 2003 over 2002 however we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change if fuel costs change rapidly we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods when fuel costs change more quickly than our compensating fuel surcharges we recovered through our fuel surcharge programs substantially all of the increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year 2003 we currently have no contracts or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs insurance and claims costs rose during 2003 primarily due to higher premium costs while our accident frequency declined in 2003 severity or the cost per accident increased over 2002 general and administrative 

  

  

expenses include driver recruiting and testing bad debts and professional service fees all of which increased in 2003 gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category we had a net loss of approximately 11 million on equipment and other dispositions in 2003 compared with a 18 million loss in 2002 these losses were primarily a result of revenue equipment which was lost or written off

  

our net interest expense declined to 172 million in 2003 from 248 million in 2002 we were able to reduce our total debt levels to 172 million as of december 31 2003 from 343 million at the end of 2002 this reduced debt level was primarily a result of improved earnings and cash flow in 2003 and proceeds from a secondary stock offering which closed in mid2002 our effective income tax rate increased to 431 in 2003 from 308 in 2002 this higher tax rate was primarily due to our increased level of earnings the driverper diem plan and a reversal of a 77 million noncash tax benefit taken in 2003 related to certain saleleaseback transactions that closed in 1999 as previously mentioned we implemented a driver perdiem pay plan in early 2003 this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company however it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rate the 77 million reversal of tax benefits was retroactive to january 1 2003 and related to a proposed adjustment by the irs that would disallow the tax benefits associated with a series of saleandleaseback transactions which occurred in 1999 this issue is discussed in further detail under “risk factors” 

  

the “equity in loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace inc tpi effective january 1 2003 we increased our interest in tpi to approximately 37 from 27 in 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources   cash flow 

  

we generate significant amounts of cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 394 million in 2004 333 million in 2003 and 174 million in 2002 part of the increase in net cash provided from 2002 through 2004 was a result of our continued improvement in net earnings increases in net cash provided have also resulted from deferred income taxes tax benefits of stock options exercised and higher levels of accrued payroll and other accrued expenses some of the significant changes in the trade accounts payable balances which appear on our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2002 through 2004 were a result of timing differences among years of insurancerelated payments cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment the higher level of cash used in investing activities during 2004 was due to delayed tractor purchases in early 2003 while we were still testing the new epacompliant engines and our decision in late 2003 to commence purchasing tractors that were under capital lease arrangements we paid 608 million in 2004 to purchase tractors which were previously under capital lease programs at december 31 2004 we have no revenue equipment on capital leases in 2004 we also purchased approximately 59 million of intermodal trailing equipment that had been under operating lease programs 

  

net cash used in financing activities during 2003 and 2004 reflects payments of our remaining debt and capital lease obligations our improving cash flows allowed us to close calendar year 2004 with no balance sheet debt and no capital lease obligations in addition we reinitiated the payment of a cash dividend in early 2004 and in december 2004 announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 12 from 03 per share we also announced in december 2004 our intent to purchase up to 100 million of our common stock during the next year 

  

  

selected balance sheet data 

  

   

from time to time our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the years 2002 through 2004 as previously mentioned the board in december 2004 authorized the purchase of up to 100 million of our common stock during the next year we commenced repurchases of our common stock in january 2005 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older revenue equipment with new latemodel equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 

  

we utilized capital leases to acquire certain tractors in 2000 and 2001 since late 2001 we have been acquiring tractors and trailing equipment under purchase arrangements and anticipate purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future we are currently committed to spend approximately 189 million net of expected proceeds from sale or tradein allowances on revenue equipment and construction of new facilities 

  

we are authorized to borrow up to 150 million under our current revolving line of credit which expires november 14 2005 we had no balances outstanding on this line at december 31 2004 while we do anticipate some need to borrow on our revolver during 2005 we believe that our liquid assets cash generated from operations and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future our revolving line of credit does not contain “ratings triggers” that would accelerate payments or amounts due under the agreement 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we have no remaining capitalized leases at december 31 2004 our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 20300 trailers and 5100 containerschassis that were subject to operating leases and we had approximately 151 million of obligations remaining under these leases our standby letters of credit are also not recorded on our books at december 31 2004 since there were no balances outstanding at that time under these arrangements

risk factors 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices excess capacity in the trucking industry surpluses in the market for used equipment interest rates fuel taxes license and registration fees insurance premiums selfinsurance levels and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for baddebt losses in addition our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

  

we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets 

  

some of these factors include 

  

•   we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with lessthantruckload carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do

  

•   some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins

  

•   many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected

  

•   many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors

  

•   certain of our customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations

  

•   the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size

  

•   advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2004 our top 10 customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 42 of our revenue our largest customer is walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 15 of our total revenue in 2004 generally we do not have longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our intermodal business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe and the norfolk southern railroad the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results we also utilize the services of a number of thirdparty dray carriers to perform a significant number of our origin and destination pickups and deliveries in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts 

  

  

  

we are currently engaged in an arbitration process with the burlington northern santa fe bnsf railroad to clarify certain financial and operating terms in our joint service agreement jsa 

  

as previously reported we are currently engaged in an arbitration process with the burlington northern santa fe bnsf railroad to clarify certain financial and operating terms in our joint service agreement jsa bnsf provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our jbi business segment the jsa is an agreement between bnsf and us which was signed in 1996 and defines a number of financial and operating arrangements relative to our intermodal business the jsa specifies arbitration as the method of resolving disagreements if a mediation process does not result in resolution we were unable to resolve our differences with bnsf through mediation during the second quarter of 2004 

  

the current arbitration process commenced on july 7 2004 according to the jsa any amounts due us or payable to bnsf determined through the arbitration process could be retroactive to july 7 2004 both parties have continued to exchange and analyze data during late 2004 and early 2005 formal arbitration proceedings are currently scheduled for april and may 2005 at this time we are unable to reasonably predict the outcome of this process and as such no gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded normal commercial business activity between the parties including load tendering load tracing billing and payments continues on a timely basis 

  

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

periodically the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers including ics a shortage of qualified company drivers and ics has proven to be particularly severe during 2003 and 2004 in spite of significant increases in driver compensation and recruiting costs the industry is currently experiencing a significant shortage of drivers if we are unable to continue to attract an adequate number of drivers or contract with enough independent contractors we could be required to significantly increase our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings during 2004 we selfinsured a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage and health claims for amounts up to the first 2 million for auto accidents and 1 million for workers’ compensation these deductible limits are the same for 2005 if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected also we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we selfinsure with licensed insurance companies insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking companies as a result our insurance and claims expenses could increase when some of our current coverages expire on july 31 2005 if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain sale andleaseback transactions 

  

in 1999 we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately 175 million this transaction was examined by the irs in an audit of our 1998 and 1999 tax returns in december 2003 we received an irs notice of proposed assessment which disallows the tax benefits associated with these transactions and as a result we have filed an appeal in the matter we have had preliminary discussions with the irs appeals division and have been informed that the irs examination division has been instructed to prepare additional work since their case had not been developed adequately for the appellate hearing to date we have not been contacted by the irs examination division to provide any additional information for their review if a resolution of the matter cannot be reached in the appeals process the irs will forward a 90 day letter also known as a notice of deficiency a resolution of the dispute could occur at any point in the administrative process or could extend through a trial and 

  

  

court appeals if we are unsuccessful in defending this transaction we could owe additional taxes and interest in 2003 after receiving the irs notice of proposed assessment and reviewing applicable accounting literature we reversed the 2003 expected noncash tax benefits of approximately 77 million recognized during 2003 and suspended any further recognition of the benefit based on events occurring subsequent to december 31 2004 we established a reserve for a contingent tax liability of 336 million including accrued interest expense which represents all previous tax benefits recognized on these transactions the liability for this contingency is included on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2004 as a longterm liability we continue to believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from our external public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into these transactions and we continue to vigorously defend against the irs position using all administrative and legal processes available if the irs were successful in disallowing 100 of the tax benefit from this transaction the total ultimate impact on liquidity could be approximately 44 million excluding interest 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

  

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

the us department of transportation dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

  

effective january 4 2004 the fmcsa an administration within the dot changed the regulations that govern driver hours of service as previously described these new rules generally allow a driver to drive for up to 11 consecutive hours rather than 10 but require 10 hours of offduty time rather than 8 in addition more offduty “sleeper berth” time is required before onduty time is allowed the united states court of appeals issued a decision in july 2004 rejecting these new hoursofservice hos rules the court’s rejection was based on concerns regarding drivers’ health as well as other issues on september 30 2004 the current hos rules were extended for one year or the time at which the fmcsa develops a set of new rules on february 7 2005 the bush administration proposed legislation that would convert the current hos regulations into statutory law a move that would keep the current rules in effect despite the court of appeals action to overturn them 

  

as part of a 1998 consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa a number of heavyduty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their engines produced subsequent to october 1 2002 in november 2002 we ordered approximately 2100 new tractors primarily for our jbi and dcs fleets which were equipped with mercedes engines these engines were exempt from the epa’s october 2002 rules in late 2003 after extensive testing we commenced receiving new tractors with the 2002 epacompliant engines at december 31 2004 we operated approximately 2100 tractors with the mercedes engines and about 4870 tractors with the 2002 epacompliant engines in addition to higher initial purchase prices these new tractors have also experienced an average 3 to 5 reduction in fuel efficiency we are uncertain if future maintenance costs will be higher on the average for these two groups of tractors as they 

  

  

age we do anticipate continued increases in ownership and fuel costs as regular replacement and fleet addition tractors increase the percentage of our fleet with the epacompliant units a new set of proposed fuelemission standards mandated by the epa is expected to become effective in 2007 we are unable to predict the impact these proposed standards will have on our future operations and financial results 

  

rapid changes in fuel costs can impact our periodic financial results 

  

fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our thirdlargest general expense category during the past three years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly with prices at times changing as much as 10 to 15 per gallon between consecutive months we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2004 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 

  

we have a 17 million account receivable from transportacion maritima mexicana tmm related to the sale of our share of a mexican joint venture 

  

as previously mentioned we sold our joint venture interest in mexico to tmm during the first quarter of 2002 for 225 million we have received 180 million in principal and interest payments on this note at december 31 2004 we had a 17 million account receivable from tmm we expect to receive these remaining funds during the first quarter of 2005 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb revised fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities  interpretation no 46r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of certain variable interest entities for public entities that are not small business issuers the provisions of interpretation no 46r are effective no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march 15 2004 if the variable interest entity is considered to be a specialpurpose entity interpretation no 46r shall be applied no later than the first reporting period that ends after december 15 2003 the adoption of this interpretation did not have any material effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  this statement amends the guidance in apb opinion no 29 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  apb 29 provided an exception to the basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar assets requiring that some nonmonetary exchanges be recorded on a carryover basis sfas 153 eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reporting entity the provisions of sfas 153 are effective for exchanges of nonmonetary assets occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 as of december 31 2004 we believe that sfas 153 will have no significant effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment  sfas no 123r is a revision of sfas no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  and supersedes apb 25 among other items sfas 123r eliminates the use of apb 25 and intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 123r the cost will be based on the grantdate fair value of the award and will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award for public entities that do not file as 

  

  

small business issuers the provisions of the revised statement are to be applied prospectively for awards that are granted modified or settled in the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2005 when we adopt the standard on july 1 2005 we will be required to report in our financial statements the sharebased compensation expense for the last six months of 2005 and may adopt it using the modifiedprospective method effective july 1 2005 we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 123r will have on us and based on our preliminary analysis expect to report approximately 23 million of additional compensation expense during the period july 1 2005 through december 31 2005 as a result of this new accounting standard 

  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm debt we from time to time have utilized interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes none were outstanding at december 31 2004 risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in shortterm market interest rates if shortterm market interest rates average 10 more during the next 12 months there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations based on the fact that we had no variablerate debt outstanding at december 31 2004 at december 31 2004 we also had no longterm debt obligations outstanding 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2004 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2004 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations

business strategy 

  

we seek to add value to each of our customer’s supply chain by providing superior service at competitive rates while reducing our customers’ costs through network density transportation mode conversion and dedicated fleets we believe that our operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits and returns to shareholders 

  

recent focus 

  

during the past three years we have taken significant steps to reestablish a primary focus on the profitability of our three business segments in each segment we have implemented yield management decisionmaking processes that result in the deployment of our assets where we believe they will generate more profit we continually seek to replace lessprofitable freight with highermargin freight and lanes selective pricing actions and ensuring that we properly charge for all services provided have also been areas of major focus 

  

jbt segment 

  

our primary transportation service offerings classified in this segment include full truckload dryvan freight which is predominantly transported utilizing companycontrolled tractors we pick up our freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee most of our loads are transported entirely by our companyowned tractors and employee drivers or by independent contractors ics who agree to transport freight in our trailers we also assign freight to be handled by thirdparty motor carriers other than ics typically in these cases the charges for the entire movement are billed to the customer by us and we in turn pay the third party for their portion of the transportation services provided 

  

we operate utilizing certain canadian authorities allowing us to transport freight to and from all points in the continental united states to quebec british columbia and ontario we have authorization to operate directly in all the canadian provinces but to date we have served limited points in canada primarily through interchange operations with canadian motor carriers we operated our jbt and jbi intermodal segments in combined fashion in periods prior to january 1 2000 this combined operation was reported as vanintermodal “van” in prior periods in late 2000 we began utilizing ics in the jbt segment and at december 31 2003 we had approximately 1000 ics operating in the jbt segment jbt gross revenue for calendar year 2003 was 841 million compared with 827 million in 2002 at december 31 2003 the jbt segment operated 4429 companyowned tractors and employed 6228 people 5300 of whom were drivers 

  

jbi segment 

  

the transportation service offerings of our jbi segment utilize agreements with all major north american rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental united states canada and mexico our jbi segment began operations in 1989 with a unique partnership with the former santa fe railway now the burlington northern santa fe a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint marketing environment essentially jbi draws on the intermodal also known as “container on flatcar” services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries “drayage” for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations jbi provides seamless coordination of the rail and overtheroad transport movements for our customers and delivers single billing for the complete doortodoor service 

  

 

our intermodal program has grown from 20 loads in late 1989 to over 527000 in 2003 jbi operates more than 20000 companycontrolled containers system wide the entire fleet is comprised of 53foot highcube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal doublestack economics and superior ride quality jbi also manages a fleet of nearly 1050 tractors and about 1380 drivers in support of intermodal operations at december 31 2003 the total jbi employee count approximated 1600 including drivers gross revenue for the jbi segment in calendar year 2003 was 936 million compared with 809 million in 2002 

  

dcs segment 

  

since 1992 we have offered dedicated contract carriage as a service option dcs segment operations specialize in the design development and execution of supplychain solutions capitalizing on advanced systems and technologies dcs offers engineered transportation solutions that support private fleet conversion dedicated fleet creation and transportation system augmentation dcs operations typically provide customized services that are governed by longterm contracts and currently include dryvan flatbed and temperaturecontrolled operations near 100 ontime service is standard with efficient routes executed to design specifications 

  

dcs operations focus on reducing costs and enhancing customer value through leveraging the jbht network for backhaul repositioning freight network freight may be used to reposition equipment near outbound domiciles thereby reducing inefficient empty miles and system cost dcs also frequently finds synergy in shared resources with the jbt and jbi segments including terminals drivers maintenance shops bulk fuel locations and trailer pools providing further economies of scale dcs gross revenue for calendar year 2003 was 671 million compared with 628 million in 2002 at december 31 2003 the dcs segment operated 4456 tractors and employed 5529 people 4898 of whom were drivers 

  

logistics business and associated company 

  

we formally began offering transportation logistics services in 1992 through a wholly owned subsidiary jb hunt logistics jbl jbl services frequently included an arrangement whereby a shipper might outsource a substantial portion of its entire distribution and transportation process to one organization the jbl segment business included a wide range of comprehensive transportation and management services including experienced professional managers information and optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of system solutions a new logistics customer or service arrangement frequently required a significant amount of upfront analysis and design time during which alternatives were considered and custom systems and software were developed effective july 1 2000 we contributed substantially all of our jbl segment business all related intangible assets and 5 million of cash to a newlyformed company transplace inc tpi 

  

tpi is an internetbased global transportation logistics company tpi commenced operations in july 2000 and initially included substantially all of the logistics business of jbht covenant transport inc swift transportation co inc us xpress enterprises inc and werner enterprises inc tpi gross revenue for calendar year 2003 was 655 million compared with 672 million in 2002 we initially had an approximate 27 ownership interest in tpi in november 2002 we agreed to purchase a portion of werner enterprises inc’s werner ownership interest in tpi effective january 1 2003 our interest in tpi increased from 27 to 37 and werner’s interest declined from 15 to 5 the financial results of tpi are included on a oneline nonoperating item included on our consolidated statements of earnings entitled “equity in loss of associated companies” 

  

operations in mexico   

we have provided transportation services to and from mexico since 1989 these services frequently involve equipment interchange operations with various mexican motor carriers in addition a joint venture agreement with transportacion maritima mexicana tmm one of the largest transportation companies in mexico was signed in 1992 the joint venture comercializadora internacional de carga sa de cv and its subsidiaries originated and completed northbound and southbound international truck movements between the united states and mexico the joint venture also provided mexican domestic irregular route truck service 

  

 

refrigerated freight services mexican dedicated contract business and shorthaul drayage to and from the mexican maritime ports and rail heads for the calendar year ended december 31 2001 our share of the mexican joint venture operating results was included on a oneline nonoperating item on the consolidated statements of earnings entitled “equity in loss of associated companies” 

  

during the first quarter of 2002 we sold our joint venture interest in mexico to tmm at december 31 2003 we have a note receivable balance of 136 million from tmm in connection with this sale we still provide transportation services to and from mexico primarily by utilizing the services of a variety of mexican carriers 

  

marketing and operations 

  

we transport or arrange for the transportation of a wide range of freight including forest and paper products building materials general merchandise food and beverages chemicals and automotive parts our customer base is extremely diverse and includes a growing list of fortune 500 companies our ability to offer multiple services utilizing our three business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties represents a competitive advantage we have been reasonably successful providing a broad range of transportation services to larger shippers that seek to use a limited number of “core” carriers our largest customer in 2003 was walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 13 of our total revenue 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network we do have some sales and marketing functions managed at the business unit level particularly for our dcs segment in accordance with our typical arrangements we bill the customer for all services and we in turn pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided in recent years we have reestablished a primary focus on improving the profitability of each of our business segments and charging a fair price for all services provided 

  

people 

  

we believe that one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our serviceoriented people as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 15700 employees including approximately 11600 drivers we had arrangements with about 1000 ics to transport freight in our trailing equipment we also employed nearly 1000 mechanics and about 3140 office personnel at the end of 2003 none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 

  

the truckload industry has periodically had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough qualified truck drivers it is also common for the driver turnover rate of individual carriers to exceed 100 it has been our practice during the past few years to compensate our drivers at an aboveaverage level in order to attract a high caliber of experience and minimize turnover while the cost to recruit train and retain drivers has increased during recent years we have to date not experienced significant operational disruptions due to a shortage of drivers 

  

revenue equipment 

  

as of december 31 2003 we operated approximately 9900 tractors in addition our contracted ics own and operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment we operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible particularly in our jbt and jbi fleets based on customer preference and the actual business application our dcs fleet is more diversified we believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service attracts quality drivers and lowers maintenance expense at december 31 2003 the average age of our tractor fleet was 24 years our trailers were 33 years old and our containers were 58 years old we perform routine servicing and preventative maintenance of our equipment at most of our regional terminal facilities 

  

we generally operate newer revenue equipment in our jbt segment to minimize downtime and maximize utilization our jbi segment utilizes highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked 

  

 

on rail cars we are currently in the process of upgrading our container fleet and reconditioning our chassis fleet the composition of our dcs trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and currently includes dryvans flatbeds and temperaturecontrolled units 

  

effective october 1 2002 the environmental protection agency epa required that most newly manufactured heavyduty tractor engines comply with certain new emission standards in november 2002 we committed to purchase approximately 2100 new tractors primarily for our jbi and dcs fleets which were equipped with mercedes engines these engines were exempt from the epa’s october 1 2002 rules except for these new tractors which were utilized primarily for local and regional operations we limited our new tractor purchases while we tested a limited number of the new engines in late 2003 we commenced receiving tractors with the new engines while the initial cost of these reducedemission engines is somewhat higher we have not yet determined their impact on operating costs such as maintenance and fuel economy the epa has issued additional engine operating limitations which are scheduled to apply in 2007 

  

competition 

  

according to the american trucking associations the us market for all truckbased transportation services generated revenues of approximately 605 billion in 2002 the truckload market was estimated to represent about 45 of the total or approximately 270 billion the top ten forhire truckload carriers only generate about 4 of the total revenue in this segment and we represent less than 1 of this segment revenue the market in which we compete is frequently referred to as highly fragmented and includes thousands of carriers many of which are very small while we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country 

  

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations the dot periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with all federal safety requirements and we report certain accident and other information to the dot our operations into and out of canada and mexico are also subject to regulation by those countries 

  

effective january 4 2004 the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa a separate administration within the dot changed the regulations that govern driver hours of service these new rules were the most significant changes to driver hours of service in more than 40 years in general the new rules allow a driver to drive for up to 11 consecutive hours instead of 10 but require 10 hours of offduty time rather than 8 and reduce the total number of driving hours to 14 in a 24hour period compared to 15 under the old rules in addition more offduty “sleeper berth” time is required before onduty time is allowed although the new regulations have only been in effect for a short time our current estimates indicate that these new rules should not have a significant impact on our overall operations however in certain fleets and a few specific dcs customer applications these new rules may increase our cost of operating or reduce our equipment utilization

executive summary 

  

we are one of the largest truckload transportation and logistics companies in north america our business operations are primarily organized through three business segments our jbt segment typically picks up freight loaded in trailers at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transports a complete truck load directly to the consignee jbt utilizes primarily companycontrolled tractors or ics and transports freight over highway routes jbi freight is usually loaded in containers and picked up at a shipper’s location by companycontrolled tractors or designed thirdparty dray companies and transported to railroad yards this intermodal container is then transferred from highway vehicles chassis and stacked on rail cars for what is typically the longest leg of the route at the destination rail yard jbi freight is removed from the rail car remounted on a chassis and moved to the final destination by companycontrolled tractors or dray carriers dcs segment operations vary significantly by individual customer account a dcs account may involve a limited number of tractors drivers and trailing equipment or may include a large fleet the specific services offered frequently range from typical freight transportation to laborintensive deliveries freight handling and other specialized services 

  

we separated our jbt and jbi segment business effective january 1 2000 we contributed our jbl business to a newlyformed associated logistics company in july 2000 in late 2001 we established goals to improve the operating margins of each of our three segments our financial results for calendar year 2003 represented the second consecutive year of record revenues and earnings driven by strong performance from each of our segments our financial results for 2003 were impacted by a number of items we implemented a driver pay per diem plan in february 2003 under this plan a portion of certain road driver’s pay is designated as reimbursement of expense this designation provides benefits both to our driver and to the business although the driver per diem plan increased our effective income tax rate it reduced our total segment operating costs 

  

during 2003 we also continued to focus on a process we call yield management yield management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight to determine whether business which is generating low or negative margins can be replaced by different business with better margins management actions may also involve price changes to ensure that we are charging for all services provided these price and freight mix actions favorably impacted a number of our key segment operating statistics shown in the following tables particularly revenue per loaded mile and revenue per tractor per week our yield management activities also significantly contributed to our improved margins in 2003 particularly in our jbt and dcs segments 

  

we also placed special emphasis during 2003 on dray costs and equipment utilization in our jbi segment we were able to increase the average number of loads that our drivers moved by creating pay incentives that rewarded productivity we also improved our box turns or what we call velocity which is the average number of loads moved by each container each month this continued focus allowed us to reduce our jbi segment operating ratio to 903 in 2003 from 933 in 2002 and 943 in 2001 

  

 

another area of management focus during 2003 was maintenance and revenue equipment we reduced the average age of our tractor fleet to 24 years at december 31 2003 from 26 years at the end of 2002 we also converted a portion of our maintenance work to our companycontrolled facilities from thirdpartyowned shops the combination of the newer tractor fleet and conversion to our facilities reduced overall maintenance costs in 2003 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes therefore the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from our estimates any effects on our business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs   

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims most insurance arrangements include a level of selfinsurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured the amounts of selfinsurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates during 2003 we were selfinsured for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first 15 million of each claim in january 2004 we changed our level of selfinsurance to 2 million for auto accidents and 1 million for workers’ compensation 

  

our claims accrual policy for all selfinsured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims analyses provided by thirdparty claims administrators as well as legal economic and regulatory factors our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available accordingly we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience in doing so the recorded ultimate liability considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurredbutnotreported claims we do not discount our estimated losses we are also substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment at december 31 2003 we had approximately 8 million of estimated net claims payable in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2003 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 57 million which represented prefunded claims and premiums 

  

revenue equipment   

we operate a significant number of tractors trailers and containers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements in addition we may rent 

  

 

revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straightline method over the lease term or the estimated useful life whichever is shorter 

  

we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or tradein values for certain new equipment acquired since 1999 during the fourth quarter of 2003 we reviewed the useful lives and salvage values of our tractor fleet we have utilized the guaranteed tradein values as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles in accounting for purchased and leased tractors these changes in useful lives and salvage values increased net earnings during the fourth quarter of 2003 by approximately 963000 if our tractor supplier was unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for guaranteed tradein values it could have a materially negative impact on our financial results 

  

revenue recognition   

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported accordingly a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

segments 

  

we operated three segments during calendar year 2003 the operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote 11 the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

results of operations   

2003 compared with 2002 

  

overview of 2003 

  

our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2003 totaled a record 955 million after reversing 77 million of noncash tax benefits which resulted from a saleandleaseback transaction on intermodal trailing equipment this compares with our previous record net earnings of 518 million in 2002 diluted earnings per share were 117 in 2003 also a record number compared with 66 cents in 2002 the average number of diluted shares outstanding in 2003 was approximately 5 higher than the comparable number in 2002 consolidated operating revenues were 243 billion in 2003 an increase of 8 over the 225 billion in 2002 

  

 

each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in 2003 while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during 2003 a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings we have continued our focus on yield management as well as individual load and lane profitability a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus have allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers in addition significant increases in certain operating costs such as insurance fuel and equipment have reduced the level of capacity available in the industry 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment gross revenue was 8411 million in 2003 up 2 over the 8273 million in 2002 higher fuel prices in 2003 and the resulting increase in fuel surcharge revenue accounted for this entire level of revenue growth the average tractor count in 2003 was down nearly 3 from 2002 however revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges rose 52 in the current year more than offsetting the decline in the size of the fleet and enhancing operating income 

  

operating income of the jbt segment rose to 493 million in 2003 from 266 million in 2002 in addition to the higher revenue per mile we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement plan driver per diem plan in early 2003 this new plan benefited most of our eligible drivers and increased operating income 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment gross revenue grew by 16 to 9362 million in 2003 from 8091 million in 2002 revenue growth was due in part to a strong demand for our unique intermodal service offering which generated an 11 increase in number of loads year over year freight mix changes also played an important role that led to improved revenue per load 

  

operating income in the jbi segment increased to 912 million in 2003 from 546 million in 2002 the jbi segment operating ratio improved by 300 basis points to 903 for 2003 compared to 933 for 2002 these improved financial results were attributable to our investment in upgrading our tractor fleet and adding incremental containers improved utilization of both drivers and equipment and a concentrated focus on yield management and revenue quality 

  

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue grew over 6 to 6712 million in 2003 from 6283 in 2002 revenue net of purchased transportation and fuel surcharge revenue increased 5 the increase in revenue occurred even as the business unit’s average tractor count for 2003 declined nearly 2 compared to 2002 more than offsetting the decline in the tractor fleet was a nearly 7 improvement in revenue excluding fuel surcharge per tractor per day driving this increase in productivity was an increase in length of haul of 7 and increased focus on backhaul opportunities 

  

operating income increased 130 to 452 million in 2003 versus 197 million in 2002 at the end of 2002 we began analyzing a number of underperforming accounts and identified opportunities to redeploy assets from accounts that did not offer appropriate financial returns on the segment’s assets at the same time cost controls were implemented to improve operating results at all accounts the success of these efforts improved the operating ratio by 360 basis points to 933 in 2003 cost reductions in driver pay salary and office wages and associated payroll taxes also enhanced 2003 operating income a decline of 16 in the average age of the tractor fleet helped reduce maintenance costs and an ongoing commitment to safety contributed to an improvement in the segment’s insurance and claims costs we also incurred certain new startup costs in 2002 associated with several large accounts that did not impact 2003 revenue growth will continue to be driven by improvement in productivity and new customer opportunities that provide appropriate financial returns to justify commitment of additional assets 

  

 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

  

  

   

consolidated operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses increased 47 in 2003 over 2002 while operating revenues increased 83 the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by 310 basis points to 924 in 2003 from 955 in 2002 as previously mentioned increases in revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges and the implementation of a driver per diem plan were two of the more significant factors driving these changes we also increased the number of independent contractors ics in our jbt fleet to 994 at december 31 2003 from 679 at the end of 2002 when we replace companyoperated tractors and driver employees with ics certain costs such as salaries wages employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 

  

fuel cost per gallon was approximately 13 higher in 2003 over 2002 however we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change if fuel costs change rapidly we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods when fuel costs change more quickly than our compensating fuel surcharges we recovered through our fuel surcharge programs substantially all of the increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year 2003 we currently have no contracts or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs insurance and claims costs rose during 2003 primarily due to higher premium costs while our accident frequency declined in 2003 severity or the cost per accident increased over 2002 general and administrative expenses include driver recruiting and testing bad debts and professional service fees all of which increased in 2003 gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category we had a net loss of approximately 11 million on equipment and other dispositions in 2003 compared with a 18 million loss in 2002 these losses were primarily a result of revenue equipment which was lost or written off 

  

 

our net interest expense declined to 172 million in 2003 from 248 million in 2002 we were able to reduce our total debt levels to 172 million as of december 31 2003 from 343 million at the end of 2002 this reduced debt level was primarily a result of improved earnings and cash flow in 2003 and proceeds from a secondary stock offering which closed in mid2002 our effective income tax rate increased to 431 in 2003 from 308 in 2002 this higher tax rate was primarily due to our increased level of earnings the driver per diem plan and a reversal of a 77 million noncash tax benefit taken in 2003 related to certain saleleaseback transactions that closed in 1999 as previously mentioned we implemented a driver per diem pay plan in early 2003 this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company however it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rate the 77 million reversal of tax benefits was retroactive to january 1 2003 and related to a proposed adjustment by the internal revenue service that would disallow the tax benefits associated with a series of saleandleaseback transactions which occurred in 1999 in addition to the reversal of tax benefits recorded in 2003 we have suspended the recognition of any future tax benefits effective january 1 2004 this issue is discussed in further detail under “risk factors” 

  

the “equity in loss of associated company” item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace inc tpi effective january 1 2003 we increased our interest in tpi to approximately 37 from 27 in 2002 jbht’s financial exposure is limited to its approximate 78 million investment in tpi since we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi’s financial obligations

our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2002 were 518 million or diluted earnings per share of 66 cents compared with 2001 fullyear earnings of 329 million or 46 cents per diluted share we generated 101 million of operating income in 2002 a nearly 40 increase over the 722 million of operating income in 2001 our operating ratio was 955 in 2002 and 966 in 2001 our increase in 2002 net earnings was in spite of an effective income tax rate which rose to 308 from 235 in 2001 and the number of diluted shares outstanding increasing by nearly 8 the increase in shares outstanding reflected a secondary public offering which closed in june 2002 each of our three segments contributed to the improved earnings levels in 2002 

  

jbt segment 

  

jbt segment gross revenue was essentially flat totaling 8273 million in 2002 and 8286 million in 2001 however 2002 revenues were generated with approximately 3 fewer tractors in addition 2002 fuel surcharge revenues were 142 million lower than the comparable amount in 2001 which negatively impacted the revenue comparison by approximately 2 truck segment operating income rose to 266 million in 2002 from 87 million in 2001 the improvement in 2002 operating income reflected higher revenue per loaded mile reduced empty miles and lower driver pay rates a significant portion of the higher revenue per loaded mile and reduced empty miles was a result of our continued focus on yield management and improved revenue quality a reduction in driver pay per mile was primarily a result of changes in pay scales for newlyhired drivers 

  

jbi segment 

  

jbi segment gross revenue grew 9 to 8091 million in 2002 from 7405 million in 2001 revenue growth was due in part to continued demand for our intermodal service offering and conversion of our container fleet to solely 53foot units operating income in the jbi segment rose to 546 million in 2002 from 421 million in 2001 our jbi operating ratio was 933 in 2002 and 943 in 2001 financial results in this segment were enhanced by improved container utilization improved driver productivity and a focus on revenue quality 

  

 

dcs segment 

  

dcs segment revenue grew nearly 15 to 6283 million in 2002 from 5487 million in 2001 revenue growth was primarily a result of a 9 increase in the size of the dcs tractor fleet and our focus on improving the quality of individual fleets while operating income rose to 197 million in 2002 from 174 million in 2001 the segment’s operating ratio was 969 in 2002 and 968 in 2001 we reduced some costs in the dcs segment such as driver pay and overhead however higher accident and claims expenses as well as new account startup costs more than offset the improvements 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

consolidated operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses in 2002 increased 59 over 2001 while operating revenues rose 70 our operating ratio improved to 955 in 2002 compared with 966 in 2001 salaries wages and employee benefits expense increased 36 in 2002 and declined to 364 of revenue in 2002 from 376 in 2001 as previously mentioned a lower mileage pay rate in our jbt segment for newlyhired drivers and the use of additional independent contractors were primary contributors to the relationship of this cost category to operating revenues partly offsetting a decline in drivers’ wages relative to revenue were increases in maintenance wages workers’ compensation health insurance and office employee incentive expenses we opened some new companymanaged maintenance facilities and increased our mechanic labor force by about 14 in order to reduce the amount of maintenance that we outsource we also experienced higher costs in workers’ compensation and other fringe benefit programs and paid additional incentive payments to our office and administrative personnel that resulted from improved 2002 net earnings 

  

rents and purchased transportation expense increased 155 primarily due to the growth of our jbi business segment and the related payments to railroads and drayage carriers and the use of more independent 

  

 

contractors the 68 decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily a result of fuel costs per gallon averaging about 5 less vs 2001 operating supplies and expenses were down 103 in 2002 reflecting the reduced amount of outsourced tractor and trailer maintenance work and our focus on reducing travel expenses the 324 increase in insurance and claims costs reflects escalating liability insurance premiums that have been experienced industrywide and our higher accident costs the significant increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher driver advertising and recruiting expense in 2002 and changes in our gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions in 2002 we had a 18 million net loss on equipment and facility dispositions compared with a net gain of 48 million in 2001 

  

our net interest expense declined in 2002 partly due to the approximate 68 million of capital we raised through a secondary public offering of common stock which closed in june 2002 we increased our effective income tax rate to 308 in 2002 from 235 in 2001 primarily to reflect additional taxes associated with our increased earnings 

  

equity in losses of associated companies reflects our share of operating results for tpi and for our mexican joint venture amounts included the following 

  

   

the year 2001 financial results of our mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our interests during the first quarter of 2002 we sold our jointventure interest in mexico for its carrying value to the majority owner transportacion maritima mexicana tmm we recorded an 181 million note receivable from tmm which according to the terms of the sale was to be paid in four annual payments of approximately 45 million plus interest at 5 per annum through june 2005 in june 2002 we agreed to extend the principal payment to june 2006 we have received interest payments within the terms of the renegotiated note we are accounting for interest income on a cash basis and have a note receivable of 136 million as of december 31 2003 the next principal and interest payment is due in june 2004 

  

liquidity and capital resources   

cash flow 

  

we generate significant amounts of cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 333 million in 2003 174 million in 2002 and 172 million in 2001 the significant changes in trade accounts payable which appear on our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2003 and 2002 were partly a result of timing differences among years of insurancerelated items cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment during the latter part of 2000 through late 2001 we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors tractor additions since october 2001 have been purchased in late 2003 we began purchasing tractors that were under capital lease programs at the end of the initial lease term we paid approximately 47 million in residual values for tractors under lease arrangements that terminated in 2003 and anticipate purchasing the remaining leased tractors for approximately 67 million in 2004 in december 2003 we purchased approximately 196 million of intermodal trailing equipment that had been under an operating lease program the majority of trailing equipment additions during 2000 and 2001 were under operating lease agreements these lease agreements mature over a fouryear period beginning in 2006 and ending in 2009 since march 2002 predominately all trailing equipment additions have been purchased 

  

 

the 95 million of outstanding 700 notes are due in september 2004 and the final 10 million of 780 subordinated notes are due in october 2004 we anticipate that our current cash balance cash flow generated from operations during the year and unused revolving lines of credit will be sufficient to retire this debt as it comes due by the end of 2004 we anticipate that our only remaining obligations will consist primarily of operating leases for trailing equipment 

  

selected balance sheet data 

  

   

from time to time our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock however we have not repurchased any of our common stock since 2000 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older revenue equipment with new latemodel equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have recently obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations we have also utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 

  

as mentioned above we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors from late 2000 through late 2001 since late 2001 we have been acquiring tractors and trailing equipment under purchase arrangements and plan to continue purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future we currently are committed to spend in the range of 185 million net of expected proceeds from sale or tradein allowances on revenue equipment for 2004 and believe our current cash on hand cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds 

  

we are authorized to borrow up to 150 million under our current revolving lines of credit which expire november 14 2005 we had no balances outstanding under these lines at december 31 2003 and also no outstanding balances at the end of 2002 under the terms of our credit and note agreements we are required to maintain certain financial covenants including leverage tests minimum tangible net worth tests and other financial ratios we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december 31 2003 also our revolving lines of credit do not contain “ratings triggers” that would accelerate payments or amounts due under the agreement 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

all of our leases related to tractors have been accounted for as capital leases and are carried on our balance sheet our only offbalance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment which are described above as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 20300 trailers and 6660 containerschassis that were operated subject to operating leases and we had approximately 207 million of obligations remaining under these leases our standby letters of credit are also not recorded on our books at december 31 2003 since there were no balances outstanding at that time under these arrangements

risk factors 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on the results of our operations many of which are beyond our control these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices excess capacity in the trucking industry surpluses in the market for used equipment interest rates fuel taxes license and registration fees insurance premiums selfinsurance levels and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors 

  

we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing where we have a significant concentration of customers economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our reserve for baddebt losses in addition our results of operations may 

  

 

be affected by seasonal factors customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs 

  

we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers 

  

some of these factors include 

  

•   we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and to a lesser extent with lessthantruckload carriers and railroads some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do

  

•   many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain our profit margins

  

•   many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting socalled “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers and in some instances we may not be selected

  

•   many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors

  

•   the trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size

  

•   advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

  

for the calendar year ended december 31 2003 our top ten customers based on revenue accounted for approximately 38 of our revenue our largest customer is walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 13 of our total revenue in 2003 generally we do not have longterm contracts with our customers and we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 

  

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business 

  

our intermodal business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads while we have agreements with various class i railroads the majority of our business travels on the burlington northern santa fe railway and the norfolk southern railroad the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results in addition a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the united states through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts 

  

difficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow 

  

periodically the trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers including independent contractors if we are unable to continue to attract drivers or contract with 

  

 

independent contractors we could be required to adjust our driver compensation package or let trucks sit idle which could adversely affect our growth and profitability 

  

ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings 

  

our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels which could reduce our earnings during 2003 we selfinsured for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss personal injury property damage workers’ compensation and health claims for amounts up to the first 15 million of each claim in january 2004 we changed our level of selfinsurance to 2 million for auto accidents and 1 million for workers’ compensation if the number or severity of claims for which we are selfinsured increases our operating results could be adversely affected also we maintain insurance above the amounts for which we selfinsure with licensed insurance companies insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking companies as a result our insurance and claims expenses could increase when our current coverage expires on july 31 2004 or we could be required to raise our selfinsured retention if these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the internal revenue service irs has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certain sale andleaseback transactions 

  

in 1999 we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately 175 million this transaction was recently examined by the irs in an audit of our 1998 and 1999 income tax returns and on december 15 2003 we received a revenue agent’s report summarizing adjustments proposed by the irs arising from this audit the irs proposes to disallow the tax benefits associated with this transaction based on their interpretation of existing tax laws and court precedents we believe this transaction conforms with the applicable tax law and we intend to vigorously defend against the irs position using all administrative and legal processes available we have received the irs notice of proposed assessment and as a result we have filed an appeal in the matter if a resolution of the matter cannot be reached in the appeals process the irs will forward a 90day letter also known as a notice of deficiency a resolution of the dispute could occur at any point in this procedure or could extend through a trial and court appeals after receiving the irs notice of proposed assessment applicable accounting literature dictated that we reverse all of the 2003 expected noncash tax benefits of approximately 77 million and cease any further recognition of the benefit there is no impact on the benefits taken in prior years however if we are unsuccessful in defending this transaction we could owe additional taxes and interest we estimate our maximum earnings exposure to be 31 million which represents the tax benefits realized through december 31 2002 plus estimated accrued interest through december 31 2003 this exposure would result if the irs succeeded in disallowing 100 of the tax benefits from this transaction 

  

our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 

  

we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal among others we also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 

  

 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with or liability for violation of existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business 

  

the us department of transportation dot and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service equipment operation safety and financial reporting we are audited periodically by the dot to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety hoursofservice and other rules and regulations if we were found to be out of compliance the dot could restrict or otherwise impact our operations 

  

effective january 4 2004 the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa an administration within the dot changed the regulations that govern driver hours of service these new rules generally allow a driver to drive for up to 11 consecutive hours rather than 10 but require 10 hours of offduty time rather than 8 in addition more offduty “sleeper berth” time is required before onduty time is allowed these new rules could increase our operating costs or reduce our equipment utilization 

  

as part of a 1998 consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa a number of heavyduty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their engines produced subsequent to october 1 2002 in november 2002 we committed to purchase approximately 2100 new tractors primarily for our jbi and dcs segments that were equipped with mercedes engines these engines were not covered by the epa’s october 1 2002 rules in late 2003 we commenced receiving tractors with the new engines while the initial cost of these reducedemission engines is somewhat higher we have not yet determined their impact on operating costs such as maintenance and fuel economy the epa has issued additional engine operating limitations that are scheduled to apply in 2007 

  

fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our thirdlargest general expense category during the past three years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly with prices frequently changing as much as 10 to 15 per gallon between consecutive months we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or outofroute miles that cannot be billed to customers rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2003 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 

  

we have a 136 million note receivable from transportacion maritima mexicana tmm related to the sale of our share of a mexican joint venture 

  

during the first quarter of 2002 we sold our jointventure interest in mexico to tmm in accordance with the original terms of the sale we recorded an 181 million note receivable which was to be paid in four annual payments of approximately 45 million plus interest in june 2002 we agreed to extend the principal payment to june 2006 we are accounting for interest income on a cash basis and have a note receivable of 136 million as of december 31 2003 the next principal and interest payment is due in june 2004 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations   statement 143 required us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development andor normal use of the assets we also were required to record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation the obligation should be adjusted at the 

  

 

end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation we adopted statement 143 on january 1 2003 the adoption of statement 143 did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51  this interpretation addressed the consolidation by business enterprises of variableinterest entities as defined in the interpretation the interpretation applied immediately to variable interests in variableinterest entities created after january 31 2003 and to variable interests in variableinterest entities obtained after january 31 2003 on october 9 2003 the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp financial interpretation no 466 which deferred the effective date for applying the provisions until march 31 2004 the adoption of interpretation no 46 is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

  




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm debt we from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes none were outstanding at december 31 2003 risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in shortterm market interest rates if shortterm market interest rates average 10 more during the next 12 months there would be no materially adverse impact on our results of operations based on variablerate debt outstanding at december 31 2003 at december 31 2003 the fair value of our fixedrate longterm obligations approximated carrying value 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2003 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2003 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations

tpi is an internetbased global transportation logistics company tpi commenced operations in july of 2000 and initially included substantially all of the logistics business of jbht covenant transport inc swift transportation co inc us xpress enterprises inc and werner enterprises inc tpi gross revenue for calendar year 2002 approximated 672 million which revenue is not included in our financial statements for 2002 we initially had an approximate 27 ownership interest in tpi in november of 2002 we agreed to purchase a portion of werner enterprises’ werner ownership interest in tpi effective january 1 2003 our interest in tpi increased from 27 to 37 and werner’s interest declined from 15 to 5 the financial results of tpi are included on a oneline nonoperating item included on our consolidated statements of earnings entitled “equity in earnings loss of associated companies” 

  

associated company  mexico

marketing and operations 

  

we transport a wide range of products including automotive parts department store merchandise paper and wood products food and beverages plastics chemicals and manufacturing materials and supplies our primary customers include many of the “fortune 500” companies our largest customer in 2002 was walmart stores inc which accounted for approximately 18 of total revenue a broad geographic dispersion and a good balance in the type of freight transported allows us some protection from major seasonal fluctuations however consistent with the truckload industry in general freight is typically stronger during the second half of the year with peak volume occurring in august through mid november revenue and earnings are also affected by bad weather holidays fuel prices driver cost and availability and railroad service levels 

  

we generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide marketing network all transportation services offered are typically billed directly to the customer by us and all inquiries claims and other customer contacts are handled by us certain marketing sales engineering and design functions are assigned to each operating segment however marketing and pricing strategy and national account service coordination is managed at the corporate level 

  

personnel 

  

at december 31 2002 we employed 16265 people including 12029 drivers historically the truckload transportation industry and jbht have experienced shortages of qualified drivers in addition driver turnover rates for truckload motor carriers frequently exceed 100 during the past few years a number of changes have occurred within the industry relative to drivers in 1996 we announced and implemented an approximate 33 increase in wages for our overtheroad drivers as anticipated this increase in driver compensation was partially offset by lower driver recruiting and training expense reduced accident and safety costs and better equipment utilization we also experienced a decline in driver turnover rates between 1997 and 1999 during late 2000 and 2001 supply and demand conditions for drivers changed and a number of truck load carriers including jbht implemented lower mileage pay rates for newly hired drivers partly as a result of this reduced compensation level for drivers our driver turnover rate increased during 2000 and has remained at historically high levels in 2001 and 2002 during calendar year 2002 we have once again experienced some difficulty attracting and retaining a desired level of drivers to date we continue to hire only experienced drivers and although recruiting costs have increased significantly operations have not been disrupted by a shortage of qualified drivers at december 31 2002 we also employed approximately 3100 office employees and 1137 mechanics none of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements 

  

revenue equipment 

  

at december 31 2002 we owned or leased 10653 company operated tractors 26087 trailers and 19672 containers we believe that modern latemodel clean equipment differentiates quality customer service increases equipment utilization and reduces maintenance costs and downtime we generally operate with newer revenue equipment in the jbt segment with the age of tractors and trailers approximating 21 years and 22 years respectively at december 31 2002 somewhat older equipment and tractors designed for local and regional operations are typically utilized in the jbi and dcs segments specially designed highcube containers which can be separated from the chassis and doublestacked on rail cars are also operated by jbi the average age of jbi tractors and containers at december 31 2002 was approximately 46 years and 52 years respectively the jbi segment commenced receiving brand new containers and reconditioned chassis in late 2001 approximately 6300 new containers and 6300 new and reconditioned chassis were placed in service during 2002 the composition of the dedicated contract fleet varies with specific customer service requirements at december 31 2002 the average age of dcs segment tractors was 28 years in november of 2002 we committed to purchase approximately 2100 new tractors the majority of which will be traded oneforone for units in the jbi and dcs fleets these trades will significantly reduce the average age of these tractor fleets all of our revenue equipment is maintained in accordance with a specific maintenance program primarily based on age andor miles traveled 

  

competition 

  

we are one of the largest publicly held truckload carriers in the united states we compete primarily with other irregular route truckload common carriers lessthantruckload common carriers and private carriers generally provide limited competition for truckload carriers jbht and our associated companies are one of a few carriers offering nationwide logistics management and dedicated revenue equipment services although a number of carriers may provide competition on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets the extensive rail network developed in conjunction with the various railroads also allows us the opportunity to differentiate our services in the marketplace 

  

 

regulation 

  

our operations as a forhire carrier are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation’s federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa and by various canadian provinces entry control barriers were substantially removed as a result of federal deregulation statutes such as the interstate commerce commission termination act of 1995 iccta the fmcsa continues to enforce safety regulations and has proposed new rules which if approved in their present form would limit driver’s hours of service president bush is considering implementation of provisions of the north america free trade agreement nafta which may result in increased competition between us and mexican carriers for truckload services moving between these two countries the clean air act of 1990 established tighter pollution standards for emissions from automobiles and trucks these new standards were effective on a phased in basis beginning with model year 1994 as part of a 1998 consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa a number of heavyduty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their engines produced subsequent to october 1 2002 jbht and a number of other truckload motor carriers believe the new engines have not yet been sufficiently tested for fuel economy and reliability while we continue to test a limited number of the new epa compliant engines we committed in november of 2002 to purchase approximately 2100 new tractors the majority of which will be equipped with mercedes engines which are not covered by the epa’s october 1 2002 rules

this report contains statements that may be considered to be forwardlooking or predictions concerning future operations or events such statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain subject to risks and should be viewed with caution these statements are based on our belief or interpretation of information currently available shareholders and prospective investors are cautioned that actual results and future events may differ materially from the forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors among all the factors and events that are not within our control and could have a material impact on future operating results include general economic and business conditions competition and competitive rate fluctuations cost and availability of diesel fuel ability to attract and retain qualified drivers a loss of one or more major customers interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads insurance costs and availability claims expense retention of key employees terrorists attacks or actions acts of war adverse weather conditions new or different environmental or other laws and regulations increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment and the ability of revenue equipment manufacturers to perform in accordance with agreements for guaranteed equipment tradein values current and future changes in fuel prices could result in significant fluctuations of quarterly earnings the above is not an allinclusive list financial and operating results of jbht may fluctuate as a result of these and other risk factors or events as described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission we assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to the extent we become aware that it will not be achieved for any reason 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 

  

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect 

•   the amounts reported for assets and liabilities

•   the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and

•   the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period

  

therefore the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from estimates any effects on business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of assets provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable exposures under selfinsurance plans and various other recorded or disclosed amounts however we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in the financial statement preparation process than others and are discussed below to the extent that actual outcomes differ from estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise estimates earnings will be affected 

  

workers’ compensation and accident costs   

we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of our expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates our current insurance coverage specifies that the self insured limit on the majority of our claims is 15 million which is prefunded with our insurance carrier we are substantially selfinsured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from our insurance companies to continually update the estimated ultimate cost of each claim at december 31 2002 we 

 

had approximately 15 million of estimated net claims payable in addition we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2002 we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 45 million 

  

revenue equipment   

we operate a significant number of tractors trailers and containers in connection with our business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating leases in addition we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straightline method over the lease term or the estimated useful life whichever is shorter 

  

we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or tradein values for certain new equipment acquired since 1999 we have utilized these values in accounting for purchased and leased tractors if the supplier was unable to perform under the terms of such agreements it could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

  

revenue recognition   

we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported accordingly a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

segments 

  

we operated three segments during calendar year 2002 segments included truck jbt intermodal jbi and dedicated contract services dcs jbt business included full truckload dryvan freight which is primarily transported utilizing companyowned or controlled revenue equipment freight in the jbt segment is typically transported over roads and highways and no portion of a movement involves railroads the jbi segment includes freight which is transported by rail over at least a portion of the movement jbi freight may also include certain repositioning truck loads which are moved by jbi equipment or thirdparty carriers in circumstances where the movement directs jbi equipment back toward intermodal operations dcs segment business usually includes companyowned revenue equipment and employee drivers who are assigned to a specific customer traffic lane or service dcs operations most frequently involve formal written longterm agreements which govern services performed and applicable rates 

  

prior to july 1 2000 the logistics business segment jbl primarily consisted of jb hunt logistics a whollyowned subsidiary which provided a wide range of comprehensive transportation and freight management services such services included experienced professional managers information and freight optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of freight system solutions jbl utilized jbt jbi or dcs owned or controlled assets and employees thirdparty carriers or a combination of these options to meet service requirements jbl services were typically provided in accordance with written longterm agreements effective july 1 2000 jbl exchanged its ownership in substantially all of its assets for an initial membership interest in tpi as of january 1 2003 we increased our interest in tpi from approximately 27 to 37

in millions of dollars 

  

   

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing in this annual report 

  

overview of 2002 

  

our consolidated net earnings for calendar year 2002 were 518 million or diluted earnings per share of 133 compared with 2001 fullyear earnings of 329 million or 91 cents per diluted share we generated 101 million of operating income in 2002 a nearly 40 increase over the 722 million of operating income in 2001 our operating ratio was 955 in 2002 and 966 in 2001 our increase in 2002 net earnings was in spite of an effective income tax rate which rose to 308 from 235 in 2001 and the number of diluted shares outstanding increasing by nearly 8 the increase in shares outstanding reflects a secondary public offering which closed in june of 2002 each of our three segments contributed to the improved earnings levels in 2002 

  

jbt segment gross revenue was essentially flat totaling 8273 million in 2002 and 8286 million in 2001 however 2002 revenues were generated with approximately 3 fewer tractors in addition 2002 fuel surcharge revenues were 142 million lower than the comparable amount in 2001 which negatively impacted the revenue comparison by approximately 2 truck segment operating income rose to 266 million in 2002 from 87 million in 2001 the improvement in 2002 operating income reflected higher revenue per loaded mile reduced empty miles and lower driver pay rates a significant portion of the higher revenue per loaded mile and reduced empty miles was a result of our continued focus on yield management and improved revenue quality the reduction in driver pay per mile was a result of changes in pay scales for newlyhired drivers 

  

jbi segment gross revenue grew 9 to 8091 million in 2002 from 7405 million in 2001 revenue growth was due in part to continued demand for our intermodal service offering and conversion of our container fleet to 100 53foot units operating income in the jbi segment rose to 546 million in 2002 from 421 million in 2001 our jbi operating ratio was 933 in 2002 and 943 in 2001 financial results in this segment were enhanced by improved container utilization improved driver productivity and a focus on revenue quality 

  

dcs segment revenue grew nearly 15 to 6283 million in 2002 from 5487 million in 2001 revenue growth was primarily a result of a 9 increase in the size of the dcs tractor fleet and our focus on improving the quality of individual fleets while operating income rose to 197 million in 2002 from 174 million in 2001 the segment’s operating ratio was 969 in 2002 and 968 in 2001 we reduced some costs in the dcs segment such as driver pay and overhead however higher accident and claims expenses as well as new project start up costs more than offset the improvements 

  

 

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

consolidated operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses in 2002 increased 59 over 2001 while operating revenues rose 70 our operating ratio improved to 955 in 2002 compared with 966 in 2001 salaries wages and employee benefits expense increased 36 in 2002 and declined to 364 of revenue in 2002 from 376 in 2001 as previously mentioned a lower mileage pay rate in our jbt segment for newlyhired drivers and the use of additional independent contractors were primary contributors to the relationship of this cost category to operating revenues partly offsetting a decline in drivers’ wages relative to revenue were increases in maintenance wages workers’ compensation health insurance and office employee incentive expenses we opened some new company managed maintenance facilities and increased our mechanic labor force by about 14 in order to reduce the amount of maintenance that we outsource we also experienced higher costs in workers’ compensation and other fringe benefit programs and paid additional incentive payments to our office and administrative personnel that resulted from improved 2002 net earnings 

  

rents and purchased transportation expense increased 155 primarily due to the growth of our jbi business segment and the related payments to railroads and drayage carriers and the use of more independent contractors the 68 decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily a result of fuel costs per gallon averaging about 5 less vs 2001 operating supplies and expenses were down 103 in 2002 reflecting the reduced amount of outsourced tractor and trailer maintenance work and our focus on reducing travel expenses the 324 increase in insurance and claims costs reflects escalating liability insurance premiums which have been experienced industry wide and our higher accident costs the significant increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to higher driver advertising and recruiting expense in 2002 and changes in our gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions in 2002 we had a 18 million net loss on equipment and facility dispositions compared with a net gain of 48 million in 2001 

  

our net interest expense declined in 2002 partly due to the approximate 68 million of capital we raised through a secondary public offering of common stock which closed in june of 2002 we increased our effective income tax rate to 308 in 2002 from 235 in 2001 primarily to reflect additional taxes associated with our increased earnings 

  

 

equity in losses of associated companies reflects our share of operating results for tpi and for our mexican joint venture amounts included the following 

  

 

  

jbht’s financial exposure is limited to its approximate 85 million investment in tpi as we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi’s financial obligations 

  

the year 2001 financial results of our mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our interests during the first quarter of 2002 we sold our joint venture interest in mexico for its carrying value to the majority owner transportacion maritima mexicana tmm we recorded an 181 million note receivable from tmm which according to the terms of this sale will be paid in four annual payments of approximately 45 million plus interest at 5 per annum through june of 2005 the first payment was received as scheduled in june of 2002

operating segments 

for years ended december 31 

in millions of dollars 

  

   

as of december 31 2000 tpi qualified as a reportable business segment for financial reporting purposes however the logistics segment jbl information for 2001 shown above excludes tpi tpi is accounted for on the equity method and does not qualify as a reporting segment in 2001 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing in this annual report 

  

overview of 2001 

  

financial and operating results for the year 2001 were impacted by a number of significant items general economic conditions in the transportation industry were soft during the majority of the year and fuel costs varied dramatically sometimes changing more than 10 from one month to the next however overall fuel costs for 2001 were down from the prior year consolidated operating revenues for 2001 decreased approximately 3 from 2000 excluding the jbl operations which were contributed to tpi as of july 1 2000 revenue growth for the remaining business segments was approximately 6 the growth in the remaining segments is attributable to expansion of our operating fleet of tractors from an average of 10055 in 2000 to 10710 in 2001 an average increase of 655 tractors or 65 while fuel costs and related fuel surcharge revenues varied significantly during 2001 the net change in fuel surcharge revenue had less than a 1 impact on revenue between 2001 and 2000 

  

jbt segment revenue totaled 8286 million in 2001 down 1 from 2000 this decline was due in part to the softer economy that created a reduced demand for freight jbt began focusing on improving the operating ratio through cost management initiatives rather than jbt fleet growth we had no plans to grow the jbt fleet until such time that a reasonable operating income had been achieved warranting the additional investment of capital jbt tractor count 

  

 

including independent contractors ic’s declined nearly 3 during 2001 and tractor utilization was also down approximately 3 however revenue per loaded mile increased 39 excluding fuel surcharges reflecting freight mix changes and pure rate increases the truck segment generated operating income of 87 million in 2001 compared with a loss of 71 million in 2000 as a result of a new initiative commenced in late 2000 the number of ic’s in jbt grew to 337 in 2001 from 16 at the end of 2000 continued volatility in the earnings power of the truck unit is likely to prevail until supply and demand factors in the truckload industry improve additional improvement is significantly dependent upon increases in the availability of freight 

  

jbi segment business was reasonably strong during 2001 and grew 9 to 7405 million from 6811 million in 2000 the intermodal segment held its tractor count essentially flat at 910 during 2001 unlike the other segments growth of jbi is not easily tracked by number of tractors as jbi can utilize outside dray carriers and the other jbht business units to support load and revenue growth the increase in revenue can be attributed to a 5 increase in the number of loads from 2000 to 2001 coupled with a 17 increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges as a result of revenue growth and utilization of containers jbi operating income climbed 15 in 2001 to 421 million from 367 million in 2000 

  

dcs segment revenue grew 15 during 2001 to 5487 million from 4786 million in 2000 this growth rate was down significantly from recent years due to 1 soft economic conditions which made companies more apprehensive about changing or outsourcing their transportation needs and 2 our unwillingness to reduce rates to increase market share the dcs segment tractor fleet grew by 15 during 2001 but revenue growth was limited by idle tractors throughout most of the year dcs generated 174 million of operating income in 2001 compared with 284 million in 2000 the lower margin and reduced operating income was primarily a result of idle tractors and a higher proportionate amount of shared trailer pool and corporate support costs being assigned to the business as a result of improving the tracking of trailer usage and the increased internal transfer price which is charged by jbt and jbi when dcs utilizes their assigned trailers cost control and close analysis of individual fleet profitability remains a dcs objective 

  

for the year ended december 31 2001 jbht’s share of tpi’s results of operations totaled a loss of 19 million compared with earnings of 440000 for the six month period ended december 31 2000 tpi’s operating loss in 2001 was primarily due to start up expenses jbht’s financial exposure is limited to its approximate 64 million investment in tpi as we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi’s financial obligations 

  

the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

 

consolidated operating expenses 

  

total operating expenses in 2001 declined 33 from 2000 decreasing in relative proportion to operating revenues our operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues improved slightly to 966 in 2001 from 971 in 2000 as previously mentioned the jbl segment was contributed to tpi effective july 1 2000 this approximate 10 reduction in consolidated operating revenues was the primary factor in reduced rents and purchased transportation expense the jbi segment relied solely on jbt and third party carriers for transportation services and accordingly purchased transportation costs as a percent of revenue were significantly higher than the other segments the decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily due to significantly lower fuel cost per gallon in late 2001 the increase in 2001 operating supplies and expenses reflected higher tractor and trailing equipment maintenance and tire costs insurance and claims costs reflected higher collision rates in jbt during 2001 the significant decline in general and administrative expenses was due to an approximate 55 million gain on the sale of a group of trailers which closed in march of 2001 gains on revenue equipment dispositions are included in this expense classification and totaled a net gain of 48 million in 2001 compared with a loss of 267000 in 2000 

  

equity in earnings loss of associated companies reflects our share of operating results for tpi and for the mexican joint venture equity in earnings amounts included the following 

  

 

  

the year 2001 financial results of our mexican joint venture primarily reflected adjustments to the carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of our interests we had an agreement in principle for a sale to the majority owner of the joint venture this transaction was consummated in early 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources   

cash flow 

  

we generate significant amounts of cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 174 million in 2002 172 million in 2001 and 125 million in 2000 while 2002 and 2001 reflected a typical level of cash provided by operating activities 2000 was impacted by a significant prepayment for an operating lease which was funded in early 2000 cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment during the latter part of 2000 through late 2001 we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors tractor additions since october 2001 have been purchased the majority of our trailing equipment additions since october 2000 have been under operating lease programs net cash provided by financing activities in 2002 reflects our 68 million secondary stock offering which closed in june of 2002 we discontinued a commercial paper borrowing program during 2001 and ceased paying cash dividends in early 2000 

  

selected balance sheet data 

  

   

 

from time to time our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock purchases of jbht stock were 

  

 

  

liquidity 

  

our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older tractors and trailing equipment with new late model equipment we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions we have recently obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations we have also utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 

  

as mentioned above we utilized capital leases to acquire tractors from late 2000 through late 2001 we started purchasing tractors and containers in october of 2001 and plan to continue purchasing tractors and containers in the foreseeable future we have been acquiring dry van trailing equipment since october of 2000 primarily under operating lease programs we currently expect to spend in the range of 220 million net of expected proceeds from sale or tradein allowances on revenue equipment for the full calendar year of 2003 

  

we are authorized to borrow up to 150 million under our current revolving lines of credit which expire november 14 2005 we had no balances outstanding under these lines at december 31 2002 under the terms of our credit and note agreements we are required to maintain certain financial covenants including leverage tests minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial ratios we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants at december 31 2002 as of december 31 2002 we had committed to purchase approximately 184 million of revenue and service equipment net of proceeds from sale or tradein allowances we believe that our current liquid assets cash generated from operations and our revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future

risk factors 

  

in 1999 we entered into a series of transactions effecting a sale and leaseback of a portion of our intermodal container and chassis fleet for a selling price of approximately 175 million these transactions used a structure that the internal revenue service irs has recently indicated it intends to examine we have voluntarily disclosed these transactions to the irs and in october of 2002 the irs began their examination of the specific facts of these transactions if the irs challenges our transactions we intend to vigorously defend them however if the irs successfully challenges these transactions and is successful in disallowing some or all of the tax benefits that we realized these actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

  

our effective income tax rates were 308 235 and 150 for the years 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively we implemented an accountable expense reimbursement plan for a portion of our drivers in february of 2003 driver per diem while this plan will generally benefit both jbht and the majority of our drivers it results in a higher effective income tax rate partly as a result of this change and anticipated higher earnings we are currently estimating an effective income tax rate of 37 to 39 for calendar year 2003 

  

in 1997 the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc commenced an action against us in federal district court alleging that we had violated the americans with disabilities act by refusing to hire as truck drivers certain individuals who were taking certain medications the eeoc sought injunctive relief and damages for a group of 540 individuals the district court dismissed the eeoc’s complaint on our motion for summary judgment the eeoc appealed this decision to the federal court of appeals the federal court of appeals upheld the district court’s decision in our favor however the eeoc may still appeal this case to higher courts if the higher courts rule against us we could be subject to a new trial in the district court 

  

in a separate action filed in michigan in november 2001 by a group of eight former employees the plaintiffs alleged that we violated the elliottlarsen civil rights act of michigan in february 2003 we reached an agreement to settle this complaint the terms of the settlement are to remain confidential by agreement however this contemplated settlement will not materially impact our financial statements or results of operations 

  

in october 2002 we were assessed a judgment of approximately 7 million for an accident that occurred in august 2001 we are currently in dispute over the total value of this judgment and plan to file the appropriate appeals we believe based on advise from outside counsel that it is probable that this award will be substantially reduced by the appellate court however if we are unsuccessful in our appeal to the appellate court the ultimate payments to the claimant could have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

inflation could have a material impact on our business a prolonged or unusual period of rising costs could result in fuel wages insurance interest or other costs increasing rapidly and could adversely affect our results of operations if we were unable to increase freight rates accordingly the impact of inflation has been minimal during the past three years 

  

our business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations these factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel costs excess capacity in the trucking industry surpluses in the market for used equipment interest rates fuel taxes license and registration fees insurance premiums selfinsurance levels and difficulty attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors we are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles 

  

we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources that we do some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain or retain business especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy which may limit our ability to maintain rates or maintain our profit margins 

  

 

we depend on third parties in the operation of our business our intermodal business segment utilizes a number of railroads in the performance of transportation services while the majority of these services are provided pursuant to written agreements with the railroads the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 

  

if we are unable to retain our key employees our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed we are highly dependent upon the services of a number of our officers and other key employees we do not have employment agreements with any of these employees the loss of any of their services could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or future profitability 

  

as part of a 1998 consent decree with the us environmental protection agency epa a number of heavyduty diesel engine manufacturers agreed to significantly reduce emissions from their engines which were produced subsequent to october 1 2002 we have not yet had sufficient time to test these new engines we will continue to test a limited number of the new epa compliant engines in november of 2002 we committed to purchase approximately 2100 new tractors primarily for our jbi and dcs segments which will be equipped with mercedes engines these engines are not covered by the epa’s october 1 2002 rules except for these 2100 tractors which will be utilized primarily for local and regional operations we expect to limit new tractor purchases until we are able to complete further testing and evaluation of the epa compliant engines in addition these new epa compliant engines are expected to increase the acquisition and operating costs of these tractors and may negatively impact our future profitability 

  

fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our third largest general expense category during the past three years fuel cost per gallon has varied significantly with prices frequently changing as much as 10 to 15 per gallon between consecutive months we have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel however there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers in addition we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise which cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold weather and empty or outofroute miles which cannot be billed to customers in february of 2003 fuel prices averaged approximately 15 higher than december of 2002 and 45 higher than february of 2002 rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability as of december 31 2002 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 143 sfas no 143 requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development andor normal use of the assets we also record a corresponding asset which is depreciated over the life of the asset subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation we were required to adopt sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 the adoption of sfas 143 will not have a material effect on our financial statements 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 34  this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize at inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december 15 2002 and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123  this statement amends fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition this statement amends the disclosure requirements of 

  

 

statement no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm debt we from time to time utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes none were outstanding at december 31 2002 risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in shortterm market interest rates if shortterm market interest rates average 10 more during the next twelve months there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations based on variable rate debt outstanding at december 31 2002 at december 31 2002 the fair value of our fixed rate longterm obligations approximated carrying value 

  

although we conduct business in foreign countries international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 accordingly we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment to date we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production seasonality weather and other market factors historically we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases as of december 31 2002 we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 

  




 item 9 disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

no reports on form 8k have been filed within the twentyfour months prior to december 31 2002 involving a change of accountants or disagreements on accounting and financial disclosure

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

  certain amounts included in or affecting the company’s financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated requiring certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 

  

  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 

•   the amounts reported for assets and liabilities 

•   the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 

•   the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

  

  therefore the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances nevertheless actual results may differ significantly from estimates any effects on business financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

  

  in preparing financial statements and related disclosures management must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of assets provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable exposures under selfinsurance plans and various other recorded or disclosed amounts however management believes that certain accounting policies are of more significance in the financial statement preparation process than others and are discussed below to the extent that actual outcomes differ from estimates or additional facts and circumstances cause management to revise estimates earnings will be affected 

  

  workers’ compensation and accident costs   

  the company purchases insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers’ compensation vehicular collisions and accidents and cargo claims most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim but provide an umbrella policy to limit the company’s exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates the company’s current insurance coverage specifies that the first 5000 of any claim is self insured and that the self insured limit on certain claims was up to 2 million in 2001 and decreased to 15 million effective january 1 2002 which is prefunded with its insurance carrier the company is substantially self insured for loss of and damage to its owned and leased revenue equipment company safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated ultimate cost of each claim at december 31 2001 the company had approximately 14 million of estimated net claims payable in addition the company is required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums at december 31 2001 the company had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately 38 million 

  

  

  

  

  

  during the fourth quarter of 2001 the company modified its method of estimating and recording its ultimate cost related to auto liability and workers’ compensation claims which will result in a more accurate estimate of the company’s ultimate loss from claims the company began applying loss development factors to its accident and workers’ compensation claims history this new method results in a more accurate estimate of the company’s ultimate loss from claims than its prior method this new method resulted in a restatement of the following balances at december 31 1998 a 102 million decrease in retained earnings a 163 million increase in claims payable and a 61 million increase in deferred tax assets these adjustments had no material impact on year 2000 and 1999 consolidated earnings 

  

  revenue equipment   

  the company operates a significant number of tractors trailers and containers in connection with its business this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating leases in addition revenue equipment may be rented from third parties and various railroads under shortterm rental arrangements revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or tradein value equipment acquired under capital leases is initially recorded at the net present value of the minimum lease payments and amortized on the straightline method over the lease term or the estimated useful life which ever is shorter 

  

  the company has an agreement with its primary tractor supplier for guaranteed residual or tradein values for certain new equipment acquired since 1999 the company has utilized these values in accounting for purchased and leased tractors if the supplier was unable to perform under the terms of such agreements it could have a material negative impact on the company’s financial results 

  

  revenue recognition   

  the company recognizes revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported accordingly a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 

  

  segments 

  

  the company operated three segments during the calendar year 2001 segments included truck jbt intermodal jbi and dedicated contract services dcs jbt business included full truckload dryvan freight which is primarily transported utilizing companyowned or controlled revenue equipment freight in the jbt segment is typically transported over roads and highways and no portion of a movement involves railroads the jbi segment includes freight which is transported by rail over at least a portion of the movement jbi freight may also include certain repositioning truck loads which are moved by jbi equipment or thirdparty carriers in circumstances where the movement directs jbi equipment back toward intermodal operations dcs segment business usually includes companyowned revenue equipment and employee drivers who are assigned to a specific customer traffic lane or service dcs operations most frequently involve formal written longterm agreements which govern services performed and applicable rates 

  

  prior to july 1 2000 the logistics business segment jbl primarily consisted of jb hunt logistics a whollyowned subsidiary which provided a wide range of comprehensive transportation and freight management services such services included experienced professional managers information and freight optimization technology and the actual design or redesign of freight system solutions jbl utilized jbt jbi or dcs owned or controlled assets and employees or thirdparty carriers or a combination to meet service requirements jbl services were typically provided in accordance with written longterm agreements effective july 1 2000 jbl exchanged its ownership in substantially all of its assets for an initial membership interest in tpc

  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and related footnotes appearing in this annual report 

  

  overview of 2001 

  

  financial and operating results for the year 2001 were impacted by a number of significant items general economic conditions in the transportation industry were soft during the majority of the year and fuel costs varied dramatically sometimes changing more than 10 from one month to the next however overall fuel costs for 2001 were down from prior year consolidated operating revenues for 2001 decreased approximately 3 from 2000 excluding the jbl operations which were contributed to tpc as of july 1 2000 revenue growth for the remaining business segments was approximately 6 the growth in the remaining segments is attributable to expansion of the company’s operating fleet of tractors from an average of 10055 in 2000 to 10710 in 2001 an average increase of 655 tractors or 65 while fuel costs and related fuel surcharge revenues varied significantly during 2001 the net change in fuel surcharge revenue had less than a 1 impact on revenue between 2001 and 2000 

  

  jbt segment revenue totaled 8286 million in 2001 down 1 from 2000 this decline was due in part to the softer economy that created a reduced demand for freight the company began focusing on improving the operating ratio through cost management initiatives rather than jbt fleet growth the company has no plans to grow the jbt fleet until such time that a reasonable operating income has been achieved warranting the additional investment of capital jbt tractor count including independent contractors ic’s declined nearly 3 during 2001 and tractor utilization was also down approximately 3 however revenue per loaded mile increased 32 excluding fuel surcharges reflecting freight mix changes and pure rate increases the truck segment generated operating income of 87 million in 2001 compared with a loss of 71 million in 2000 as a result of a new initiative commenced in late 2000 the number of ic’s in jbt grew to 337 in 2001 from 16 at the end of 2000 continued volatility in the earnings power of the truck unit is likely to prevail until supply and demand factors in the truckload industry improve additional improvement is significantly dependent upon increases in the availability of freight 

  

  jbi segment business was reasonably strong during 2001 and grew 9 to 7405 million from 6811 million in 2000 the intermodal segment held its tractor count essentially flat at 910 during 2001 unlike the other segments growth of jbi is not easily tracked by number of tractors as jbi can utilize outside dray carriers and the other jbht business units to support load and revenue growth the increase in revenue can be attributed to a 5 increase in the number of loads from 2000 to 2001 coupled with a 17 increase in revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges as a result of revenue growth and utilization of containers jbi operating income climbed 13 in 2001 to 421 million from 367 million in 2000 

  

  

  

 

  

  dcs segment revenue grew 15 during 2001 to 5487 million from 4786 million in 2000 this growth rate was down significantly from recent years due to 1 soft economic conditions which made companies more apprehensive about changing or outsourcing their transportation needs and 2 the company’s unwillingness to reduce rates to increase market share the dcs segment tractor fleet grew by 15 during 2001 but revenue growth was limited by idle tractors throughout most of the year dcs generated 174 million of operating income in 2001 compared with 284 million in 2000 the lower margin and reduced operating income was primarily a result of idle tractors and a higher proportionate amount of shared trailer pool and corporate support costs being assigned to the business as a result of improving the tracking of trailer usage and the increased internal transfer price which is charged by jbt and jbi when dcs utilizes their assigned trailers cost control and close analysis of individual fleet profitability remains a dcs objective as in the case of truck dcs has no fleet growth planned for 2002 

  

  for the year ended december 31 2001 the company’s share of tpc’s results of operations totaled a loss of 19 million compared with earnings of 440000 for the six month period ended december 31 2000 tpc’s operating loss in 2001 was primarily due to start up expenses jbht’s financial exposure is limited to its approximate 64 million investment in tpc as the company has not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpc’s financial obligations 

  

  the following table sets forth items in the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

   

  consolidated operating expenses 

  

  total operating expenses in 2001 declined 33 from 2000 decreasing in relative proportion to operating revenues the company’s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues improved slightly to 966 in 2001 from 971 in 2000 as previously mentioned the jbl segment was contributed to tpc effective july 1 2000 this approximate 10 reduction in consolidated operating revenues was the primary factor in reduced rents and purchased transportation expense the jbi segment relied solely on jbt and third party carriers for transportation services and accordingly purchased transportation costs as a percent of revenue were significantly higher than the other segments the decline in fuel and fuel tax expense was primarily due to significantly lower fuel cost per gallon in late 2001 the increase in 2001 operating supplies and expenses reflected higher tractor and trailing equipment maintenance and tire costs insurance and claims costs reflected higher collision rates in jbt during 2001 the significant decline in general and administrative expenses was due to an approximate 55 million gain on the sale of a group of trailers which closed in march of 2001 gains on revenue equipment dispositions are included in this expense classification and totaled a net gain of 48 million in 2001 compared with a loss of 267000 in 2000 

  

  

  

 

  

  equity in earnings loss of associated companies reflects the company’s share of operating results for tpc and for the mexican joint venture equity in earnings amounts included the following 

  

 

  

  the year 2001 financial results of the company’s mexican joint venture primarily reflect adjustments to the carrying value of the investment due to the anticipated sale of the company’s interests the company has an agreement in principle for a sale to the majority owner of the joint venture this transaction is expected to be consummated in early 2002 if the transaction closes under the current terms and conditions no material impact on earnings is anticipated

  overview of 2000 

  

  financial and operating results for the year 2000 were impacted by a number of significant items consolidated operating revenues for 2000 increased 6 over 1999 excluding the jbl operations which were contributed to tpc as of july 1 2000 revenue growth for the remaining segments was approximately 15 the increase in fuel surcharge revenue associated with higher costs of fuel in the current year accounted for approximately 4 of revenue growth for these remaining segments prior to january 1 2000 the jbt and jbi businesses had been operated and reported together as the van business segment accordingly 2000 was the first full year that certain jbt and jbi identifiable information was available 

  

  jbt segment revenue increased 9 to 8338 million in 2000 from 7632 million in 1999 revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges increased 32 in 2000 the jbt company ownedleased tractor fleet totaled 5850 at december 31 2000 a new initiative to utilize independent contractors who own their tractors was commenced in late 2000 the jbt segment had operating arrangements with 16 independent contractors at december 31 2000 the jbt segment incurred an operating loss of 71 million in 2000 since the jbt and jbi segments were operated in combined fashion during 1999 no comparative operating results were available a portion of the year 2000 jbt operating loss was due to certain costs incurred to separate the jbt and jbi business units 

  

  

  

  

  

  the jbi segment business grew 5 to 6811 million in 2000 from 6516 million in 1999 intermodal revenue per loaded mile in 2000 exclusive of fuel surcharges was essentially flat compared with 1999 the increase in revenue was primarily due to a 5 increase in revenue per load over 1999 and the jbi tractor fleet totaled 908 at december 31 2000 the intermodal segment generated operating income of 367 million in 2000 a comparable amount for 1999 is not available 

  

  during 2000 dcs segment revenue grew 49 to 4786 million from 3202 million in 1999 a portion of the dcs segment revenue growth was due to transfers of equipment and drivers from the jbt business segment the dcs tractor fleet increased 43 to total 3890 at december 31 2000 dcs operating income was 284 million in 2000 compared with 241 million in 1999 the lower margin on the dcs segment business in 2000 was primarily due to a higher proportionate share of corporate support costs being assigned to the business 

  

  the jbl business was contributed to tpc effective july 1 2000 jbl generated 230 million of revenue and 81 million of operating income between january 1 2000 and june 30 2000 the company’s share of tpc’s results of operations was reported on a oneline nonoperating item on the consolidated statements of earnings and totaled 440000 in 2000 no gain or loss was recognized upon formation and contribution of jbl segment assets to tpc 

  

  the following table sets forth items in the consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 

  

  

   consolidated operating expenses 

  

  total operating expenses in 2000 increased 64 over 1999 in relative proportion to the increase in operating revenues the company’s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues increased to 971 in 2000 from 964 in 1999 as previously mentioned the jbl segment was contributed to tpc effective july 1 2000 this change reduced the rate of revenue growth and was the primary factor in the reduction of rents and purchased transportation expense as a percent of revenue in 2000 the significant increase in fuel and fuel tax expense was driven by an approximate 35 higher cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon in 2000 fuel surcharges which were initiated in late 1999 recovered approximately 90 of higher fuel costs during 2000 the more than 20 increase in operating taxes and licenses expense was due to the 13 increase of the tractor fleet and higher state base plate license cost per tractor in 2000 the decline in general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of unusually high bad debt expense in 1999 and system support charges paid by tpc in 2000 those payments to the company from tpc reduced general and administrative expenses gain and loss on equipment dispositions are also included in this classification and totaled a loss of 267000 and 849000 in 2000 and 1999 respectively the lower year 2000 interest expense reflected the reduction of average debt balances partly due to the use of the proceeds from sale and leaseback transactions to pay outstanding debt balances 

  

  

  

  equity in earnings of associated companies reflects the company’s share of operating results for tpc and for the mexican joint venture equity in earnings amounts include the following 

  

 

  

  liquidity and capital resources   

  cash flow 

  

  the company generates significant amounts of cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to 172 million in 2001 compared to 125 million in 2000 and 136 million in 1999 the increase from 2000 to 2001 was mainly due to increases in prepaid lease expense related to a significant upfront payment for an operating lease in late 2000 the decrease in cash provided by operations in 2000 versus 1999 is due to the items mentioned above and the company’s decision to acquire revenue equipment through capital and operating leases rather than purchase 

  

  net cash used in investing activities was 24 million in 2001 100 million in 2000 and 19 million in 1999 the primary use of funds for investing activities was the acquisition of new revenue equipment net invested cash was reduced in 2001 primarily due to the utilization of operating and capital leases net invested cash in 1999 was reduced by proceeds from a sale and leaseback of approximately 175 million of trailing equipment 

  

  cash used in financing activities was 103 million in 2001 32 million in 2000 and 113 million in 1999 the increase in 2001 is due primarily to net repayments of commercial paper the decrease in 2000 when compared to 1999 is due to the use of proceeds received from the sale leaseback transaction in 1999 to reduce the outstanding commercial paper balance at december 31 1999

  liquidity 

  

  the company’s continued growth is primarily contingent upon it’s ability to provide funds in order to obtain revenue equipment various financing arrangements including purchases capital leases and operating leases are utilized from time to time to fund revenue equipment additions a tractor capital lease program was initiated in july of 2000 and the majority of tractor acquisitions through september 2001 were under this program tractor additions since october of 2001 have been purchased with excess cash flow the majority of trailing equipment additions since october of 2000 have been under operating lease programs effective in november of 2001 the jbi business unit began to take delivery of the first of 6000 new containers the company expects to purchase these containers and the majority of tractor acquisitions during 2002 using funds provided from operations and shortterm debt 

  

  under the terms of its various financing and leasing agreements the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants including leverage tests minimum tangible net worth levels and other financial ratios the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants at december 31 2001 one operating lease arrangement requires the company to maintain an investment grade credit rating for the company’s senior unsecured debt the company currently is rated bbb by standard  poors and baa3 by moody’s a credit rating downgrade to bb by standard  poors or to ba1 by moody’s while not expected by the company could result in an adjustment to the rental payments under the obligation management estimates that such a credit downgrade could result in a 19 million annual increase in the associated rental payments

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

  in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” fas 141 and statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 142 fas 141 requires all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method under fas 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life the amortization provisions of fas 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june 30 2001 with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july 1 2001 the company is required to adopt fas 142 effective january 1 2002  the company has no negative goodwill as contemplated under statements 141 and 142 related to its equity method investments the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

  in july 2001 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” statement 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset statement 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 the company is currently assessing the impact of statements 143 on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

  

  in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” fas 144 which supersedes both statement of financial accounting standards no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” fas 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 30 “reporting the results of operations—reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” opinion 30 for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion fas 144 retains the fundamental provisions in fas 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on longlived assets held for use and longlived assets to be disposed of by sale while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with fas 121 for example fas 144 provides guidance on how a longlived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment establishes criteria for when a longlived asset is held for sale and prescribes the accounting for a longlived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale fas 144 retains the basic provisions of opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business unlike fas 121 an impairment assessment under fas 144 will never result in a writedown of goodwill rather goodwill is evaluated for impairment under fas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” 

  

  the company is required to adopt fas 144 no later than its first fiscal year beginning after december 15 2001 management does not expect the adoption of fas 144 for longlived assets held for use to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements because the impairment assessment under fas 144 is largely unchanged from fas 121 the provisions of this statement for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities and therefore will depend on future actions initiated by management as a result management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of fas 144 will have on the company’s financial statements with respect to future disposal decisions 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

  the company’s earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of its issuance of shortterm debt the company from time to time utilizes interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes none were 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

outstanding at december 31 2001 risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in shortterm market interest rates if shortterm market interest rates average 10 more during the next twelve months there would be no material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations based on variable rate debt outstanding at december 31 2001 at december 31 2001 the fair value of the company’s fixed rate longterm obligations approximated carrying value 

  

  although the company conducts business in foreign countries international operations are not material to the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2001 accordingly the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company’s future costs or on future cash flows it would receive from its foreign investment to date the company has not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

marketing and operations
     jbht transports a wide range of products including automotive parts
department store merchandise paper and wood products food and beverages
plastics chemicals and manufacturing materials and supplies the companys
primary customers include many of the fortune 500 companies but no single
customer accounted for more than 12 of revenues during 2000 a broad geographic
dispersion and a good balance in the type of freight transported allows jbht
some protection from major seasonal fluctuations however consistent with the
truckload industry in general freight is typically stronger during the second
half of the year with peak volume occurring in august through mid november
revenue and earnings are also affected by bad weather holidays fuel prices and
railroad service levels

     the company generally markets all of its service offerings through a
nationwide marketing network all transportation services offered are typically
billed directly to the customer by jbht and all inquiries claims and other
customer contacts are handled by the company certain marketing sales
engineering and design functions are assigned to each operating segment
however marketing strategy pricing and national account service coordination
is managed at the corporate level

personnel
     at december 31 2000 jbht employed approximately 15980 people including
12280 drivers historically the truckload transportation industry and the
company have experienced shortages of qualified drivers in addition driver
turnover rates for truckload motor carriers frequently exceed 100 in september
of 1996 jbht announced a new compensation program for the approximate 3500
overtheroad jbt drivers this comprehensive package which was effective in
february of 1997 included an average 33 increase in wages for this group of
employees this program was designed to attract and retain a professional and
experienced work force capable of delivering a high level of customer service
as anticipated this increase in driver wages and benefits was partially offset
by lower driver recruiting and training expense reduced accident costs and
better equipment utilization the average driver turnover in the jbt segment
business was approximately 66 during 2000 drivers are typically compensated on
a ratepermile basis a rateperweek basis or a combination of factors jbht
also employed approximately 2970 office personnel and 730 mechanics at december
31 2000 no employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements and
management believes that its relationship with its employees is excellent

revenue equipment
         at december 31 2000 jbht owned or leased approximately 10650
tractors and operated 22380 trailers and 21930 containers jbht believes that
modern latemodel clean equipment differentiates quality customer service
increases equipment utilization and reduces maintenance costs and downtime the
company generally operates with newer revenue equipment in the jbt segment with
the age of tractors and trailers approximating two years and four years
respectively at december 31 2000 slightly older equipment and tractors
designed for local and regional operations are typically utilized in the jbi
segment specially designed highcube containers which can be separated from the
chassis and doublestacked on rail cars are also operated by jbi the average
age of jbi tractors and containers at december 31 2000 was approximately three
years and five years respectively the composition of the dedicated contract
fleet varies with specific customer service requirements all jbht revenue
equipment is maintained in accordance with a specific maintenance program
primarily based on age and miles traveled

competition
     jbht is one of the largest publicly held truckload carriers in the united
states it competes primarily with other irregular route truckload common
carriers lessthantruckload common carriers and private carriers generally
provide limited competition for truckload carriers jbht and its associated
companies are one of a few carriers offering nationwide logistics management and
dedicated revenue equipment services although a number of carriers may provide
competition on a regional basis only a limited number of companies represent
competition in all markets the extensive rail network developed in conjunction
with the various railroads also allows the company the opportunity to
differentiate its services in the marketplace

regulation
     the companys operations as a forhire carrier are subject to regulation by
the us department of transportations federal motor carrier safety
administration fmcsa and by various canadian provinces entry controlled
barriers have largely been removed as a result of federal deregulation statutes
such as the interstate commerce commission termination act of 1995 iccta the
fmcsa continues to enforce safety regulations and has proposed new rules which
if approved in their present form would limit drivers hours of service
president bush is considering implementation of provisions of the north america
free trade agreement nafta which may result in increased competition between
us and mexican carriers for truckload services moving between these two
countries the company believes it has responded effectively to the marketplace
changes caused by increased domestic competition and that it can effectively
respond to any foreseeable changes in fmcsa regulations or nafta implementation

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of results of operations and
financial condition

     the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements of the company and related footnotes
appearing in this annual report


summary of 2000

     financial and operating results for the year 2000 were impacted by a
number of significant items consolidated operating revenues for 2000 increased
6 over 1999 excluding the jbl operations which were contributed to tpc as of
july 1 2000 revenue growth for the remaining segments was approximately 15
the increase in fuel surcharge revenue associated with higher costs of fuel in
the current year accounted for approximately 4 of revenue growth for these
remaining segments prior to january 1 2000 the jbt and jbi businesses had
been operated and reported together as the van business segment accordingly
2000 was the first full year that certain jbt and jbi identifiable information
was available

     jbt segment revenue which consists primarily of full truckload dryvan
freight increased 9 to 8338 million in 2000 from 7632 million in 1999
revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharges increased 34 in 2000 the
jbt company ownedleased tractor fleet totaled 5850 at december 31 2000 a
new initiative to utilize independent contractors who own their tractors was
commenced in late 2000 in addition to its company owned tractors the jbt
segment had operating arrangements with 16 independent contractors at december
31 2000 the jbt segment incurred an operating loss of 71 million in 2000
since the jbt and jbi segments were operated in combined fashion during 1999
no comparative operating results were available a portion of the year 2000 jbt
operating loss was due to certain costs incurred to separate the jbt and jbi
business units

     the jbi segment business which includes primarily truckload freight
transported by rail and certain repositioning truck freight grew 5 to 6811
million in 2000 from 6516 million in 1999 intermodal revenue per loaded
mile in 2000 exclusive of fuel surcharges was essentially flat compared with
1999 the jbi tractor fleet totaled 910 at december 31 2000 the intermodal
segment generated operating income of 367 million in 2000 a comparable
amount for 1999 is not available

     dcs segment business primarily includes services provided with
companyowned revenue equipment and employee drivers assigned to specific
customers or traffic lanes during 2000 dcs segment revenue grew 49 to
4786 million from 3202 million in 1999 a portion of the dcs segment
revenue growth was due to transfers of equipment and drivers from the jbt
business segment the dcs tractor fleet totaled 3890 at december 31 2000 dcs
operating income was 284 million in 2000 compared with 241 million in
1999 the lower margin on the dcs segment business in 2000 was primarily due to
a higher proportionate share of corporate support costs being assigned to the
business

     as previously mentioned the jbl business was contributed to tpc effective
july 1 2000 jbl generated 230 million of revenue and 81 million of
operating income between january 1 2000 and june 30 2000 the companys share
of tpcs results of operations were reported in a oneline nonoperating item
on the consolidated statements of earnings and totaled 440000 in 2000 no

assets to tpc

operating expenses

     total operating expenses in 2000 increased 64 over 1999 while total
operating revenues increased 56 operating expenses expressed as a percentage
of operating revenue operating ratio were 971 in 2000 compared with 964
in 1999 these comparisons were impacted by the contribution of the jbl segment
business to tpc effective july 1 2000 salaries wages and employee benefits
increased 79 during 2000 and rose to 356 of revenue in 2000 from 349 in
1999 these increases were primarily due to increases in driver compensation
and higher costs of medical insurance the higher level of driver compensation
expense in 2000 was due to changes in the mix of drivers and not a pay rate
change rents and purchased transportation expense increased 8 and declined
slightly as a percentage of revenue reflecting a substantial decrease in
purchased transportation due to the contribution of the jbl segment business
offset by an increase in rent expense for leased revenue equipment as discussed
below fuel and fuel tax expense increased 433 and rose to 113 of revenue
in 2000 from 83 in 1999 fuel expense was driven by an approximate 35
higher cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon fuel
surcharges which were initiated in late 1999 recovered approximately 90 of
higher fuel costs during 2000

     depreciation expense decreased 98 and also declined as a percentage of
revenue primarily due to transactions to sell and leaseback certain trailing
equipment in 2000 and 1999 these transactions and a decision to rent rather
than buy additional trailers decreased depreciation expense and increased
rents and purchased transportation expenses in 2000 operating supplies and
expenses increased 41 but remained approximately the same percentage of
revenue in 2000 and 1999 the 204 increase in operating taxes and licenses
expense was due to the larger size of the tractor fleet and a higher state base
plate cost per tractor in 2000 communication and utility costs were up 151
primarily due to expanded data and telecommunications networks and higher
satellite communication expenses

     interest expense declined 92 in 2000 primarily due to the reduction of
average debt balances in 2000 versus 1999 resulting from the sale and
leaseback transactions the equity in earnings of associated companies amounts
represent the companys share of earnings from operations in mexico and from
tpc earnings recognized from mexican operations in 2000 totaled 43 million
compared with 31 million in 1999 earnings recognized from tpc were 440000
in 2000 the effective income tax rates were approximately 15 in 2000 and 35
in 1999 the primary reason for the decrease in the year 2000 effective income
tax rate was the benefit of the amortization of the gain on the sale and
leaseback transaction which closed in late 1999

     as a result of the above net earnings for 2000 were 361 million or
diluted earnings per share of 102 compared with 319 million in 1999 or
89 per diluted share the average number of shares outstanding remained
substantially the same in 2000 and in 1999

summary of 1999

     the 1999 financial and operating results were impacted by a number of
significant items during the year van jbt and jbi combined revenue growth
was limited to 3 partly due to rail service delays which occurred during the
second and third quarters of 1999 jbt loads increased about 6 while jbi load
count declined approximately 3 during 1999 tractor count in the van segment
was essentially flat for the year jbt revenue per loaded mile before fuel
surcharges was up approximately 1 while jbi rates declined about 1 van
revenue growth increased slightly during the fourth quarter of 1999 due to fuel
surcharges which were initiated as fuel costs began to rise significantly
operating income in the van segment was reduced in part by higher revenue
equipment maintenance and tire costs and significant increases in the cost of
fuel in addition an initiative to separate the jbt and jbi businesses
resulted in higher third party dray expense during the latter part of 1999

     dcs segment revenue grew 51 to 3202 million in 1999 from 2119 million
in 1998 this increase in dcs revenue was driven by new customer contracts and
projects and fleet additions to existing contracts the higher level of dcs
operating income during 1999 was primarily due to the growth of segment
revenue margins in the dcs business declined slightly during 1999 partly due
to higher fuel costs and higher driver wage expense the 22 increase in jbl
segment revenue during 1999 was consistent with the prior year this growth
reflected new logistics agreements with new customers and growth of business
volumes with existing customers the increase in 1999 jbl operating income was
primarily related to higher revenue levels with some lower purchased
transportation costs providing for slightly better margins on some business

     the operating losses classified as other in 1999 and 1998 were primarily
a result of corporate administrative expenses which were not allocated to the
business segments

operating expenses
     total operating expenses in 1999 increased 133 over 1998 while total
operating revenues increased 110 operating expenses expressed as a percentage
of operating revenues operating ratio were 964 in 1999 compared with 945
in 1998 salaries wages and employee benefits increased 110 during 1999 and
remained exactly the same percentage of operating revenue for 1999 and 1998
rents and purchased transportation expense increased 112 and also maintained a
consistent relationship with operating revenues while fuel costs were below
prior year levels during the first quarter of 1999 cost per gallon started to
rise during march and april during the third quarter of 1999 fuel prices
averaged nearly 20 per gallon higher than the comparable period in 1998 and
the spread widened to nearly 30 per gallon by november of 1999 for the year
1999 fuel and fuel taxes increased 232 and grew from 75 of operating
revenue in 1998 to 83 in 1999

     depreciation expense increased 61 during 1999 but declined slightly as
a percentage of operating revenues the amount of depreciation expense on
revenue equipment increased in relative proportion to the size of the fleet
depreciation expense in 1999 was reduced in part by a sale and immediate
leaseback of certain trailing equipment this transaction closed during the
fourth quarter of 1999 operating supplies and expenses increased 292 during
1999 and rose as a percentage of operating revenues this increase was
primarily due to higher revenue equipment maintenance and tire expenditures
during 1999

     insurance and claims expense which had declined significantly from 1997
to 1998 increased 241 in 1999 while the frequency of vehicle collisions
declined slightly during 1999 the severity or cost per collision rose
significantly during 1999 operating taxes and licenses increased 129 during
1999 partly due to the growth of the tractor fleet and increases in licensing
fees charged by certain states general and administrative expenses increased
331 but remained nearly the same percentage of operating revenue for both
years a portion of this increased expense was for rental and maintenance of
computer equipment communication and utilities increased 108 reflecting
expanded data and telecommunications networks and higher satellite
communications costs interest expense declined slightly and the effective
income tax rate declined to 35 in 1999 from 37 in 1998 these decreases were
due in part to the sale and leaseback transaction described above the
overall impact of this sale and leaseback transaction increased 1999 earnings
per share by approximately 02

     as a result of the above net earnings for 1999 declined to 319 million
or diluted earnings per share of 89 compared with 468 million in 1998 or
128 per diluted share the average number of weighted average shares
outstanding before the effect of dilutive stock options remained
substantially the same for 1999 and 1998 a decrease in weighted average shares
assuming dilution resulted from the decreased effect of dilutive stock options
caused by a decline in the companys average price of common stock during 1999


liquidity and capital resources

activities net cash provided by operating activities was 125 million in 2000
136 million in 1999 and 181 million in 1998 the decline in cash flow over the
past two years partly reflects the companys decision to acquire new revenue
equipment through operating leases rather than purchase other factors impacting
cash flow have been increases in prepaid lease and insurance costs in 2000
increases in accounts receivable in 1999 and 1998 a trend which was reversed in
2000 with the contribution of jbl to tpc and improvements in the receivable
aging

varied significantly during the three year period ended december 31 2000 the
total number of trailing pieces of equipment purchased was approximately 3600
in 2000 2200 in 1999 and 4700 in 1998 net cash used for investing
activities in 2000 was reduced by the sale and leaseback of approximately 66
million of trailers in september of 2000 net cash used for investing
activities in 1999 was reduced by a sale and immediate leaseback of

approximately 175 million of trailing equipment the company also elected to

5 million cash investment in tpc was also made in 2000

58 million in 1998 dividends of approximately 18 million were paid in 2000
and 71 million were paid in both 1999 and 1998 the company announced in
february of 2000 a decision to discontinue paying dividends in january of
2001 moodys investors service downgraded the ratings of the companys senior

recent accounting pronouncements
     in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statement of financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 sfas 133 establishes new
accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for
hedging activities sfas 133 requires an entity to measure all derivatives at
fair value and to recognize them in the balance sheet as an asset or liability
depending on the entitys rights or obligations under the applicable derivative
contract the recognition of changes in fair value of a derivative that affect
the income statement will depend on the intended use of the derivative if the
derivative does not qualify as a hedging instrument the gain or loss on the
derivative will be recognized currently in earnings if the derivative qualifies
for special hedge accounting the gain or loss on the derivative will either 1
be recognized in income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the
item being hedged or 2 be deferred in other comprehensive income and
reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings sfas 133 was amended by statement of financial
accounting standards no 138 sfas 138 in june 2000 that amended the
accounting and reporting standards of sfas 133 for certain derivative
instruments and certain hedging activities sfas 138 also amended sfas 133 for
decisions made by the fasb relating to the derivatives implementation group

operations or financial position

item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk


       the companys earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest
rates as a result of its issuance of shortterm commercial paper the company
from time to time utilizes interest rate swaps to mitigate the effects of
interest rate changes none were outstanding at december 31 2000 risk can be
estimated by measuring the impact of a nearterm adverse movement of 10 in
shortterm market interest rates if shortterm market interest rates average
10 more during the next twelve months there would be no material adverse
impact on the companys results of operations based on variable rate debt
outstanding at december 31 2000 at december 31 2000 the fair value of the
companys fixed rate longterm obligations approximated carrying value

       although the company conducts business in foreign countries
international operations are not material to the companys consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally foreign
currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the companys results
of operations for the year ended december 31 2000 accordingly the company is
not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the
effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the
companys future costs or on future cash flows it would receive from its foreign
investment to date the company has not entered into any foreign currency
forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge
the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
