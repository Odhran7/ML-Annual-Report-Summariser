our industry 

we operate in the following main industries within the live entertainment business live music events music venue operations the provision of management and other services to artists and athletes ticketing services and sponsorship and advertising sales 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then work with promoters who will contract with them or with artists directly to arrange events promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees artist managers primarily provide services to music artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

for music tours four to eight months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances artists in conjunction with promoters managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertising plans promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and ticket scanning at the gate and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise parking and premium seating 

ticketing services generally refers to the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also include sales through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting its fee venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets 

ticketing resale services generally refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally obtained the tickets from a venue or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket resale company is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand product or service these sponsorships typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as credit card beverage travel and telecommunications and may include event presales and onsite product activation 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts  our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists including intersegment revenue our concerts business generated 47 billion or 753 of our total revenue during 2021 we promoted more than 17200 live music and other events in 2021 while our concerts segment traditionally operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we promote we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with limited associated direct operating expenses revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival promoter we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees and service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a portion of the service charge as its fee we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps and ticket outlets during 2021 we sold 35 63 and 2 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings including intersegment revenue our ticketing business generated 11 billion or 181 of our total revenue during 2021 which excludes the face value of tickets sold and is net of the fees paid to our ticketing clients through all of our ticketing services we sold 132 million tickets in 2021 on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 151 million tickets were sold using our ticketmaster systems including through season seat packages our venue clients’ box offices and other channels through which we did not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be sometimes with our guidance and recommendations agreements with venue clients in north america and australia generally grant us exclusive rights to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients in other international markets generally grant us the right to an allocation of tickets for events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider similarly in such international markets we have venue agreements which provide ticketmaster an allocation of tickets for all events at those venues while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute a portion of their tickets inhouse through their box office and season ticket programs in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients and generally subject to ticketmaster approval the client may allocate certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and do not make those tickets available for sale by us due to these and other permitted thirdparty ticket distribution channels we do not always sell all of our clients’ tickets even at venues where we are the exclusive primary ticketing service provider and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and also varies as to any given client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing principally through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally we enter into arrangements with the holders of tickets previously distributed by a venue or other source to post those tickets for sale at a purchase price equal to a new sales price determined by the ticket holder plus a service fee to the buyer the seller in this circumstance receives the new sales price less a seller service fee 

sponsorship  advertising  our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert festival venue and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically presented exclusively to the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets including intersegment revenue our sponsorship  advertising business generated 4119 million or 66 of our total revenue during 2021 we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are usually associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through october 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and festivals and to arrange multivenue or multifestival branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of client companies across various industry categories 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 

• stadiums —stadiums are multipurpose facilities often housing local sports teams stadiums typically have 30000 or more seats although they are the largest venues available for live music they are not specifically designed for live music 

• amphitheaters —amphitheaters are generally outdoor venues with between 5000 and 30000 seats that are used primarily in the summer season we believe they are popular because they are designed specifically for concert events with premium seat packages and better lines of sight and acoustics 

• arenas —arenas are indoor venues that are used as multipurpose facilities often housing local sports teams arenas typically have between 5000 and 20000 seats because they are indoors they are able to offer amenities that other similarsized outdoor venues cannot such as luxury suites and premium club memberships as a result we believe they are popular for higherpriced concerts aimed at audiences willing to pay for these amenities 

• theaters —theaters are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may include theatrical performances these venues typically have a capacity of between 1000 and 6500 theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriatelysized venue for developing artists and more artists in general because these venues have a smaller capacity than an amphitheater or arena they do not offer as much economic upside on a per show basis theaters can also be used yearround 

• clubs —clubs are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may also include comedy clubs these venues typically have a capacity of less than 1000 and often without full fixed seating because of their small size they do not offer as much economic upside but they also represent less risk to a concert promoter because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and also may provide a more appropriatelysized venue for developing artists clubs can also be used yearround 

• restaurants  music halls —restaurants  music halls are indoor venues that offer customers an integrated live music entertainment and dining experience this category includes our house of blues ® and brooklyn bowl ® venues whose live music halls are specially designed to provide optimum acoustics and typically can accommodate between 1000 to 2000 guests a fullservice restaurant and bar is located adjacent to the live music hall we believe that the strength of the brand and the quality of the food service and unique atmosphere in our restaurants attract customers to these venues independently from a live music event and generate a significant amount of repeat business from local customers 

• festival sites —festival sites are outdoor locations used primarily in the summer season to stage large singleday or multiday concert events featuring several artists on multiple stages depending on the location festival site capacities can range from 10000 to over 100000 fans per day we believe they are popular because of the value provided to the fan by packaging several artists together for an event while festival sites only host a few events each year they can provide higher operating income because we are able to generate income from many different services provided at the event 

• other venues —other venues includes restaurants exhibition and convention halls that typically are not used for live music events 

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2021 

 

1 operated festival sites includes multiyear agreements providing us the right to use public or private land for a defined period of time leading up to and continuing after the festival we may enter into multiple agreements for a single festival site or use the same site for multiple festivals we have aggregated the agreements for each festival site and reported them as one festival site 

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

• the quality of service delivered to our artists fans ticketing clients and corporate sponsors 

• our track record and reputation in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally 

• our artist relationships 

• our global footprint 

• the quality of our ticketing software and services 

• our ecommerce site and its extensive database 

• our diverse distribution platform of venues 

• the scope effectiveness and expertise of our advertising and sponsorship programs and 

• our financial stability 

although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or greater financial marketing technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music promotion industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg another planet entertainment cts eventim jam productions ltd imp outback presents and teg dainty in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in north america europe asia and australia aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg presents concerts west frontier touring goldenvoice and messina touring group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include asm global madison square garden entertainment corp the nederlander organization and bowery presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america europe australia and new zealand some of our competitors in venue management may have more attractive or a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through telephone and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase it has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services have created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale notwithstanding federal and state prohibitions we actively develop and apply methods to mitigate the impact of these bots however the bot technology constantly evolves and changes the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events 

we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc cts eventim ag eventbrite etix seatgeek ticketek see tickets and dice secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub vivid seats viagogo and seatgeek and many others including large technology and ecommerce companies that we understand have recently entered or could enter these markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues strong brand association and attractive local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 

• privacy and the protection of personal or sensitive information 

• compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries 

• primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

• construction renovation and operation of our venues 

• licensing permitting and zoning including noise ordinances

• hazardous and nonhazardous waste and other environmental protection laws 

• sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes 

• marketing activities via the telephone and online and 

• historic landmark rules 

we believe that we are materially in compliance with these laws 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world including the european union’s gdpr as defined and discussed below in item 1a—risk factors and the california consumer protection act 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

from time to time federal state local and international authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws particularly as related to primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

the regulations relating to our food service operations in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including our websites as well as existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could affect our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol some jurisdictions have also proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues 

our people and culture

• taking care of others  in order to empower our employees to get involved in causes that are meaningful to them we provide paid time off for them to volunteer in their local communities 

while some of these programs have temporarily been impacted by the pandemic our strong commitment of taking care of every employee makes live nation a better place which in turn helps drive our operating successes 

diversity inclusion and belonging 

we are continually striving towards our goal of being as diverse as the fans and artists that we serve with an aim to uplift people across race ethnicity gender sexual orientation disability and other underrepresented groups programs key to this mission include

• industry engagement  in 2021 we further demonstrated our commitment to diversity and inclusion by joining the efforts of “diversify the stage” and signing their pledge to provide greater access to equitable opportunities for underrepresented groups in live music events and touring industries 

human capital 

our compensation philosophy is focused on attracting and retaining talented individuals who contribute to our values and help lead our dynamic and innovative environment to determine marketcompetitive pay for our employees we use a combination of entertainment and technology industry benchmarks 

we are committed to encouraging and rewarding payforperformance that is aligned with business objectives in the best interest of our shareholders for longterm growth and profitability we further strive to reward individual achievements and contributions that are both aligned with and supportive of our short and longterm goals and core business values we believe that our efforts in these areas are working and contributing to the overall success of the company as evidenced by accolades such as obtaining a great place to work® certification 201719 placing fourth on indeeds list of the worlds 50 best workplaces 2019 placing third on fast company’s most innovative companies list for the music sector 2019 and our inclusion on forbes’ best employers for diversity list 2019 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 10200 fulltime employees during regular operational times our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ seasonal and parttime employees primarily for our live music venues and festivals at the end of 2021 we employed approximately 12000 seasonal and parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 14300 seasonal and parttime employees in 2021 

labor relations 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we have good relationships with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no related significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage and our common stock if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to the covid19 pandemic 

the global covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material negative impact on our business and operating results the ultimate magnitude of this impact will depend on a variety of factors including the duration of the pandemic restrictions or new operational requirements in place or that result as our operations recommence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis the state of the global economy as a result of the pandemic and the public’s willingness to attend events with large numbers of people all of which are unknowable at this time 

in midmarch 2020 as the unprecedented impact of the global covid19 pandemic became clearer we ceased all live nation tours and closed our venues to support global efforts at social distancing and mitigating the spread of the virus and to comply with restrictions put in place by various governmental entities other concert promoters venue operators and sports leagues around the globe similarly shut down each of our segments—concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising—depends on live music and sporting events in order to generate most of its revenue while most sports leagues have recommenced some have done so at reduced capacity and thus without the typical need for ticketing similarly concerts have resumed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis often at reduced capacity and with the potential for cancellations and rescheduled events our revenue will continue to be negatively impacted until such time as concerts and sporting events resume full activity levels at full capacity on a global basis the possibility exists that these circumstances might continue for a longer period of time than current expectations 

due to the unprecedented nature of the global covid19 pandemic particularly the nonlinear recovery due in part to surges of the virus and its variants that in some instances has halted or reversed the lessening of restrictions on activities and the return to prepandemic life our ability to forecast our cash inflows is hampered and therefore our focus is on forecasting and managing operating costs and cash outflows against our overall liquidity position at this time it is impossible to know or predict whether the positive steps we saw toward returning to prepandemic event levels in various global jurisdictions in 2021 will continue or be hampered by additional waves of the virus potentially causing national and local governments around the world to once again place or retain various restrictions on gatherings of people that prohibit or greatly impair the ability to hold concert and sporting events this uncertainty exists on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis in the in the 45 countries in which we operate 

we face ancillary risks and uncertainties arising from the global covid19 pandemic in addition to any partial or complete shutdown of its revenuegenerating operations many of these risks and uncertainties are more fully described below in this item 1a whether or not such risk factors identify the global covid19 pandemic as the underlying cause and many extend beyond the initial impact of the pandemic on our business due to the uncertainty as to how the live music and sporting industries and the world in general will change in the short and long term as a result of the pandemic the risks and uncertainties described herein should be read in conjunction with those set forth below such additional or attendant risks and uncertainties include among other things 

• the impact of tightening labor markets across the globe with unemployment rates dropping resignations reaching record highs and upward pressure on salaries and wages due to inflation and demand for skilled workers in numerous fields combined with continuing supply chain issues could impact our ability to produce tours and festivals as well as open and maintain venues without timing and cost disruptions 

• the increased risk of litigation in the current and future environment such as pending lawsuits challenging aspects of our ticket refund policies and procedures 

• a reduction in the profitability of our operations whether due to increased operating costs of complying with governmental restrictions or safety precautions and protocols voluntarily undertaken such as the need to supply personal protective equipment or conduct health screenings at points of ingress or due to a reduction in revenue arising from such precautions such as the potential that venues may not be able to be filled to capacity due to spacing and social distancing limitations in place at such time 

• potential decreased willingness of artists to tour or impracticability of touring due to varying restrictions from jurisdiction to jurisdiction including the possibility that national or subnational borders are closed to travel 

• potential changes to consumer preferences for consumption of live music or sporting events due to fears of or restrictions on large gatherings 

• loss of ticketing clients due to the economic impacts of the pandemic whereby they are no longer in operation reducing the number of events to which our ticketing business can sell tickets 

• the inability to pursue expansion opportunities or acquisitions due to capital constraints 

• the future availability or increased cost of insurance coverage 

• a potential shift away from live events by sponsors and advertisers and 

• the incurrence of additional expenses related to compliance precautions and management of our company during and after this period 

the likelihood of the realization or intensification of these risks and uncertainties and the ultimate magnitude of their impact on us are not knowable or quantifiable at this time as the global covid19 pandemic and its impacts may continue for an unknown period of time thus far there have been several waves—periods where infection rates subside followed by spikes due to variants of the virus or other factors—of the pandemic which may lead to stronger restrictions being put into place for a greater duration of time different jurisdictions have and will continue to lift social distancing guidelines and restrictions on gatherings of people at different times will have varied rules in place thereafter and will respond to any future waves of the virus in different ways the longer the duration of the global covid19 pandemic and the greater the ancillary and lingering effects the greater the material negative impact on the company and its results of operations may be while vaccination programs are now in place the changing and evolving nature of the covid19 virus presents challenges to such programs making the future course and duration of the pandemic uncertain which impacts our business in a manner that is unknowable at this time 

in addition due to the reduction in cash flows we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future from the global covid19 pandemic we have proactively taken a number of steps to enhance our liquidity position including our costsavings and cash management programs described in item 8—financial statements—note 2—impact of the global covid19 pandemic and the additional debt issuances our decreased cash flows have heightened and intensified the risks described under the “risks relating to our leverage” section of the risk factors in this report there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance with the covenants in our debt and credit instruments or that we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments in order to avoid default 

we will continue to evaluate and explore additional mechanisms to attempt to ensure that we have adequate capital to fund our business including through the issuance and sale of additional debt or equity securities the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect in 2020 moody’s and sp downgraded the company’s credit ratings and applied negative outlooks to our business in 2021 moody’s and sp both revised their outlooks from negative to stable and in january 2022 sp further improved their outlook to positive we may experience negative credit actions if the pandemic and its ancillary effects persist there is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations additionally the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on the financial markets could adversely impact our ability to raise funds 

risks relating to our business and the live events and ticketing industries 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our concerts business would be adversely affected our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours four to eight months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including music artists as some agreements between a manager and an artist are not for a fixed period of time and are instead terminable at will 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consists primarily of our portion of per ticket convenience charges and per order service fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music and ticketing industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us which could negatively impact our financial results our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve within the live music industry our artist management business also competes with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone both to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists across the live music industry it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season and subscription sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the federal trade commission “ftc” the attorneys general of several individual states and various international governing bodies these restrictions include a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to a resale website owned or controlled by us is posted that the link is directing the user to a resale website and that ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances disclose when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements there are certain state laws that now ban such ticket listings and the new york attorney general has in the past brought lawsuits against resale companies for these practices 

other variables related to the competitive environment that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

• an increased level of competition for advertising dollars which may lead to lower sponsorships as we attempt to retain advertisers or which may cause us to lose advertisers to our competitors offering better programs that we are unable or unwilling to match 

• unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs including increased guarantees to artists which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via higher ticket prices 

• inability or unwillingness to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses due to insufficient cash on hand or capacity under our senior secured credit facility which could result in the loss of key tours to competitors or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 

• competitors’ offerings that may include more favorable terms than we do in order to obtain agreements for new venues or ticketing arrangements or to obtain events for the venues they operate 

• technological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees and 

• other entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer 

our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment levels fuel prices interest rates changes in tax rates and tax laws that impact companies or individuals and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions and public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

• construction of live music venues may result in cost overruns delays or unanticipated expenses 

• desirable sites for live music venues may be unavailable or costly and 

• the attractiveness of our venue locations may deteriorate over time 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have occurred and may in the future occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation in addition while we have security protocols in place at our events illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity adverse consequences including illness injury or death to the persons engaged in such activities or others and litigation against us while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

on november 5 2021 the astroworld music festival was held in houston texas during the course of the festival ten members of the audience sustained fatal injuries and others suffered nonfatal injuries following these events hundreds of civil lawsuits have been filed against live nation entertainment inc and related entities asserting insufficient crowd control and other theories seeking compensatory and punitive damages these events are the subject of an ongoing investigation by local authorities in harris county texas and are the subject of an inquiry we received from the house of representatives committee on oversight and reform we may incur material liabilities from the 2021 astroworld event for which it is currently expected liability insurance can provide sufficient coverage but at this time there are no assurances of such coverage in addition this could negatively impact our business including our ability to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage for future events costs of operating security at events and other cost and commercial ramifications these effects could have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations andor cash flows 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events increased weather variability due to climate change exacerbates weatherrelated issues we face due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

risks relating to information technology cybersecurity and intellectual property 

the success of our ticketing business and other operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as well as affiliate and thirdparty computer systems computer networks and other communication systems system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructure may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructure both of our own ticketing systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and thirdparty software computer networks and other communications systems service providers on which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war or human error in addition the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions the large infrastructure plant that is required to operate our systems requires an ongoing investment of time money and effort to maintain or refresh hardware and software and to ensure it remains at a level capable of servicing the demand and volume of business that ticketmaster receives failure to do so may result in system instability degradation in performance or unfixable security vulnerabilities that could adversely impact both the business and the consumers utilizing our services 

while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights 

due to the nature of our business we process store use transfer and disclose certain personal or sensitive information about our customers and employees penetration of our network or other misappropriation or misuse of personal or sensitive information and data including credit card information and other personally identifiable information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation inquiries and actions from governmental authorities and financial or other liabilities in addition security breaches incidents or the inability to protect information could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches and incidents could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and could result in significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer and employee information and to prevent security breaches or incidents which could result in data loss or other harm or loss such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities new variants of malware the development of new penetration methods and tools inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of customer or employee information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer and employee information the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may change frequently and as a result may be difficult for our business to detect for long periods of time in addition despite our best efforts we may be unaware of or unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches incidents and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will continue to do so in the future 

we also face risks associated with security breaches and incidents affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business in particular hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture andor may pose a security risk that could unexpectedly compromise information security for example in the second quarter of 2018 we became aware that a thirdparty customer support product used in certain jurisdictions outside the united states was infected with a malicious code that may have allowed an unauthorized party to skim customers’ personal or payment information from their browsers while we acted promptly to disable the infected thirdparty product we continue to review our systems and interface with regulatory authorities as a result of this incident these include proceedings contesting a proposed fine issued by the united kingdom’s “uk” information commissioner’s office in november 2020 against ticketmaster uk limited in connection with this incident consumers are generally concerned with the security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal state and international laws we have expended significant capital and other resources to keep abreast of the evolving privacy landscape including the establishment of a dedicated global privacy organization within our legal team however our business could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or policies including for example practices or policies regarding the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement legislation or regulations in a manner which negatively affects our business financial condition andor results of operations due to the changes in the data privacy regulatory environment we may incur additional costs and challenges to our business that restrict or limit our ability to collect transfer use disclose secure or retain personal or sensitive information these changes in data privacy laws may require us to modify our current or future products services programs practices or policies which may in turn impact the products and services available to our customers 

regulators and government enforcement actions worldwide are imposing significant fines against companies for data privacy violations our business operations including our ticketing business involve the collection transfer use disclosure security and disposal of personal or sensitive information in various locations around the world including the european union “eu” where the general data protection regulation “gdpr” governs data privacy and can result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties in addition following the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the eu on december 31 2020 we were required to separately comply with the uk’s data protection law under which additional fines and penalties could be imposed independent of the gdpr in the united states several new comprehensive privacy laws including in california virginia and colorado which go into effect in 2023 will require us to update our policies and procedures to continue to protect data as required under those laws the relationship between uk data protection law and the gdpr remains unclear including regarding how data transfers between the eu and uk will be treated the changes in the euuk and the united states could lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk 

as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions the costs associated with compliance with applicable local data privacy laws and regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes andor make changes to our products services and operations which will increase operational cost and risk 

our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business to comply with applicable federal state or international laws and regulations andor to comply with our privacy policies andor or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized collection transfer use or disclosure of personal or sensitive information or other user data may result in negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage may discourage potential users from purchasing tickets or trying our products and services and may result in proceedingsfines by governmental agencies andor private litigation brought by consumers the realization of one or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we have been granted trademark registrations and patents andor have trademark and patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign authorities for various proprietary trademarks technologies and other inventions any patent or trademark application filed may not result in a patent or trademark registration being issued or existing or future patents or trademarks may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors likewise the issuance of a patent or trademark registration to us does not mean that its processes inventions or trademark will not be found to infringe upon rights previously issued to third parties we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names or other intellectual property and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations therefore litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to governmental regulation and litigation 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

• political instability adverse changes in diplomatic relations and unfavorable economic and business conditions in the markets in which we currently have international operations or into which we may expand particularly in the case of emerging markets 

• more restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulation of the live entertainment and ticketing industries which could result in increased compliance costs andor otherwise restrict the manner in which we provide services and the amount of related fees charged for such services 

• limitations on the enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• limitations on the ability of foreign subsidiaries to repatriate profits or otherwise remit earnings 

• adverse tax consequences due both to the complexity of operating across multiple tax regimes as well as changes in or new interpretations of international tax treaties and structures 

• expropriations of property and risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities 

• diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries 

• limitations on technology infrastructure which could limit our ability to migrate international operations to a common ticketing system 

• variability in venue security standards and accepted practices 

• lower levels of internet usage credit card usage and consumer spending in comparison to those in the united states and 

• difficulties in managing operations and adapting to consumer desires due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with i business practices and customs that are common in certain foreign countries but might be prohibited by united states law and our internal policies and procedures and ii management and operational systems and infrastructures including internal financial control and reporting systems and functions staffing and managing of foreign operations which we might not be able to do effectively or costefficiently 

as we expand into new markets these risks will be intensified and will have the potential to impact a greater percentage of our business and operating results our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance and training programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary as well as those associated with newlyacquired businesses will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition given our substantial operations in the uk and the eu we face risks and uncertainties due to the uk’s exit from the european union the uk has agreed “third country” trading status in a new euuk trade and cooperation agreement applicable from january 1 2021 the trade agreement sets out arrangements in areas such as tarifffree trade in goods however it does not match the level of economic integration that existed while the uk was an eu member state there will be additional bureaucracy and cost with customs formalities vat excise duties and ata carnets for goods moved between the uk and the eu 

these risks and uncertainties include some regulatory uncertainty for data protection it has been confirmed that the uk ico will not be able to act as the single authority for eu multinationals this means that eu multinationals will often have two regulators one for uk activities and one for the rest of the eu where crossborder processing takes place live nation has been assigned a new lead authority based on its crossborder processing so it continues to have a main point of contact for the eu in addition the uk is now not part of the eu for purposes of data transfers the gdpr principle that data cannot leave the eu to the uk in this case now applies however the uk has been granted adequacy by the eu allowing data to continue to flow to the uk live nation has already documented data flows to identify where uk flows occur and have contractual templates prepared we are in the process of reviewing the uk’s international data transfer agreement laid out before the uk and will monitor whether the uk will implement an adequacy system as proposed by the uk government’s data reform package so we are prepared to comply with any transfer limitation obligations under the uk regime 

live nation as a tour sponsor will continue to use temporary worker routes into the uk now including eu and european economic area musicians and crew on the sponsor’s license for tours in europe uk musicians’ working arrangements will be subject to individual eu member states and bilateral agreements reached with the uk government in the majority of member states the working arrangements will be similar such as in france and germany in others there may be new requirements for the sponsor as a significant sponsor with a longestablished footprint across the eu and eea markets live nation remains in a strong position when european markets reopen from coronavirus restrictions 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

• privacy laws and protection of personal or sensitive information as more particularly described above under the risk factor related to our processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information 

• compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries as more particularly described above under the risk factor related to our international operations 

• primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

• construction renovation and operation of our venues 

• licensing permitting and zoning including noise ordinances 

• human health safety security and sanitation requirements 

• the service of food and alcoholic beverages 

• working conditions labor minimum wage and hour citizenship and employment laws 

• compliance with the ada and the dda 

• hazardous and nonhazardous waste and other environmental protection laws 

• sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes 

• marketing activities via the telephone and online and 

• historic landmark rules 

our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in proceedingsfines against us by governmental agencies and private actions brought by consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods additionally governmental actions such as the current sanctions by the united states department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities as well as other sanctions elsewhere in the world could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations other than as a result of laws that apply equally to all secondary ticket sellers and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage from time to time other states canadian provinces and the federal government have commenced investigations or inquiries related to other aspects of our ticketing business including a nowsettled suit brought by the canadian competition bureau relating to alleged deceptive marketing practices in addition in january 2020 we agreed with the united states department of justice to extend the duration of the consent decree we entered into in connection with our merger with ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restraints on our business see the risk factor entitled “we recently agreed with the united states department of justice to extend and clarify the courtimposed final judgment to which we became subject in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business” below we have incurred legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular segment thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in december 2019 we agreed with the united states department of justice to extend and clarify the courtimposed final judgment to which we became subject in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business 

in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc in 2010 we became subject through july 2020 to a courtimposed final judgment the “final judgment” that places certain restrictions and obligations on us in order to address the issues the united states department of justice the “doj” raised in its antitrust review of the merger pursuant to the final judgment we agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the final judgment the final judgment was due to expire in july 2020 in december 2019 we reached an agreement with the doj to clarify certain aspects of the final judgment and extend its duration through the end of 2025 the “amended final judgment” 

under the amended final judgment we may not i threaten to condition or actually condition the provision of live nation concerts on a venue choosing ticketmaster or ii retaliate ie withhold any live nation concerts in response to a venue choosing a ticketing services provider other than ticketmaster in addition pursuant to the amended final judgment i an independent monitor has been appointed to monitor and report to the doj on our compliance with the amended final judgment and investigate any potential violations thereof ii we appointed an internal antitrust compliance officer and have conducted and will continue to annually conduct internal trainings to ensure our employees fully comply with the amended final judgment iii we provided and will continue to provide notice to current or potential venue customers of the amended final judgment and its restrictions on our business conduct and iv we are subject to an automatic penalty of 1000000 for each violation we agreed to pay costs and fees for the independent monitor and the doj’s past investigation and enforcement 

during the duration of the amended final judgment we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order in addition our business will be under continued and enhanced scrutiny by the doj including by the independent monitor our compliance with the amended final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

in connection with the merger we also entered into a consent agreement with the canadian commissioner of competition the “canadian consent agreement” which had the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the final judgment on our business in canada the various terms of the canadian consent agreement expired on or before july 2020 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

• incur additional debt 

• pay dividends and make distributions 

• make certain investments 

• repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness 

• create liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• modify the nature of our business 

• enter into saleleaseback transactions 

• transfer and sell material assets and 

• merge or consolidate 

in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2021 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 995 million was 58 billion our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 5699 million with outstanding letters of credit of 601 million we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fund payments on our debt thereby reducing funds available for operations and other purposes 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

see item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments for further discussion 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

general risks relating to our business and operations 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks or disease epidemics 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters or similar events may deter artists from touring andor substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations periodic elevated terrorism alerts and fears from publicized contagious disease outbreaks have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

in the event of actual or threatened terrorism events some artists may refuse to travel or book tours which could adversely affect our business attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks which could adversely impact our operating results there have been terrorist attacks at events that we have promoted or with which we have otherwise been involved which have resulted in lawsuits questioning among other things the adequacy of the security precautions at these events while we are constantly evaluating the security precautions for our events in an effort to ensure the safety of the public no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances that we won’t face liabilities which could be substantial and materially impact our operating results in connection with such terrorist attacks at our events in addition we hold a large number of events at thirdparty venues that we do not own or operate while we do not have direct control over the security at such venues there can be no guarantees that victims of a terrorism or casualty event at such venues will not seek to impose or ultimately be successful in imposing liability on us 

while we have health and safety programs designed to mitigate the risks that are inherent in the staging of concerts and other events as well as those associated with extraordinary occurrences or actions that may take place at our events there can be no assurances that these programs will be sufficient to fully cover every possibility despite our best efforts some occurrences or actions are difficult to foresee and adequately plan for which could lead to fan vendor andor employee harm resulting in fines penalties legal costs and reputational risk that could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2021 our international operations accounted for approximately 19 of our revenue we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate operating income of 26 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and foreign exchange operating losses of 92 million and 98 million for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2019 respectively which impacted our operating income loss see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

• using a significant portion of our available cash 

• issuing equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership 

• incurring substantial debt 

• incurring or assuming contingent liabilities known or unknown 

• incurring amortization expenses related to intangibles and 

• incurring large accounting writeoffs or impairments 

in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 

• integrating the operations financial reporting technologies and personnel of acquired companies including establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls appropriate for a public company environment 

• managing geographically dispersed operations 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience 

• the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and 

• the impact of laws and regulations relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels which could significantly affect our ability to complete acquisitions and expand our business 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through october in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability in addition the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy which in turn could harm our results of operations due to the unprecedented stoppage of our concert events globally in midmarch 2020 due to the global covid19 pandemic we did not experience our typical seasonality trends in 2020 and 2021 even with the resumption of events late in the second quarter of 2021 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters in thousands 



costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms conditions and costs that are appropriate for our business however heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty business interruption contingency and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and other security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions pandemics and other incidents any such events that are of a massive scale causing significant losses to insurance providers could negatively impact the insurance marketplace and as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining sufficiently high policy limits of coverage at a cost we believe to be reasonable including coverage for acts of terrorism cyber attacks weatherrelated damage and disruptions and other perils associated with our operations including communicable diseases andor pandemics we have experienced a significant increase in our cost to obtain appropriate insurance over the past several years though it is difficult to gauge the portion of this increase that is due to conditions in the insurance marketplace generally versus that attributable to our claims history for the mass casualty cybersecurity the global covid19 pandemic and other incidents that we have faced we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2021 we had property and equipment with a net book value of 11 billion we cannot guarantee that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we cannot provide assurance that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty artists business interruption losses cyber attacks and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned or greater than expected multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 2   properties 

as of december 31 2021 we own operate or lease 165 entertainment venues throughout north america and 94 entertainment venues internationally we have a lease ending june 30 2030 for our corporate headquarters in beverly hills california used primarily by our executive group and certain of our domestic operations management staff we also lease office space and other facilities in 43 countries that support our concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising segment operations we believe our venues and facilities are generally wellmaintained and in good operating condition and have adequate capacity to meet our current business needs 

our leases are for varying terms ranging from monthly to multiyear these leases can typically be for terms of three to 10 years for our office leases and five to 25 years for our venue leases and many include renewal options there is no significant concentration of venues under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord we believe that an important part of our management activity is to negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections about our industry business and future financial results our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those discussed under item 1a—risk factors and other sections in this annual report 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items along with yearoveryear comparisons between these two years discussion of 2019 items and yearoveryear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 can be found in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2020 annual report on form 10k 

executive overview 

in 2021 we saw a meaningful restart of our operations in the second half of the year which is reflected in our financials and key performance indicators after nearly a year and a half of very limited events and ticket sales shows restarted in some key markets at scale during the third quarter in particular we saw outdoor amphitheater events as well as festivals take place in the united states and united kingdom with enthusiastic fan response despite the operational challenges associated with ramping up our concerts in a compressed timeframe increased health protocols and a tighter labor market we were able to hold most planned concerts increase overall per fan profitability and improve our operating income by over 1 billion compared to 2020 emerging from the pandemic our organization has streamlined its operations reduced costs and focused its cash management strategies for future flexibility even in the face of new covid variants and regional surges our reopening is well underway in the united states and united kingdom while other parts of the world catch up as vaccination efforts gain momentum and government responses evolve a key leading indicator of the future health of our business is transacted ticket sales and we had a record q4 with the largest number of tickets sold in a quarter and the highest gross ticket value excluding refunded tickets our resale business also hit an historic high for us in q4 

our total revenue increased by 44 billion for the full year from 19 billion in 2020 to 63 billion in 2021 all three of our segments reported revenue growth due to more events higher ticket sales and increased sponsor fulfillment over the past twelve months as a result our operating income improved by 12 billion from a loss of 17 billion in 2020 to a loss of 418 million in 2021 the improvement resulted from increased events ticket sales and sponsor client activation partially offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses as we brought employees back from furlough and began hiring new roles to execute 2021 events and prepare for 2022 the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact our yearoveryear variances 

our concerts segment revenue for the full year increased by 33 billion from 15 billion in 2020 to 47 billion in 2021 the revenue growth was a result of increased shows and fans during the year as well as higher ancillary spend per fan and pricing at our events the number of events for the full year was more than 17200 compared to approximately 8200 events in 2020 the number of fans for the full year was 351 million compared to approximately 111 million last year the growth was largely in the united states and united kingdom concerts operating loss for the full year improved by 340 million from a loss of 959 million in 2020 to 618 million in 2021 the improvement was primarily due to more shows this year an increase in net ancillary spend per fan at our amphitheater and festival events and growth in pricing across all venue types our amphitheater net ancillary spend per fan grew by double digits compared to 2019 as a result of higher consumption and our transition to cashless transactions at our major festivals that had over 100 thousand fans we also saw growth in onsite spend with our ancillary per fan increasing by doubledigits over 2019 compared to 2019 overall pricing on tickets also increased by double digits and while we have seen some adverse impacts in our operating expenses per show due to labor shortages and supply chain issues our spend per fan metrics have outpaced the higher costs 

our ticketing segment revenue for the full year increased by 946 million from 188 million in 2020 to 11 billion in 2021 the improvement resulted from an increase in ticket sales stronger pricing and a reduction in ticket refunds this year excluding refunds we sold 153 million feebearing tickets this year compared to 58 million tickets last year the improvement was almost entirely driven by sales in the united states and the united kingdom largely for concert and sporting events pricing on our feebearing tickets increased by doubledigits reflecting strong consumer demand particularly for premium seats and vip experiences our resale business bounced back dramatically in the second half of the year and q4 was our highest resale gross transaction value quarter ever at over 1 billion ticketing operating income for the year improved by 782 million from a 612 million loss in 2020 to income of 170 million in 2021 the improvement in operating results was largely driven by increased ticket sales strong ticket pricing and higher ancillary revenue streams 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue for the full year increased by 208 million from 204 million in 2020 to 412 million in 2021 the improvement was due to higher activations with our marketing partners driven by more events going on sale venues reopening and supplying more advertising content to our clients even with a compressed sales window we saw strong sales for many of our larger festivals operating income for the year increased by 157 million from 45 million in 2020 to 202 million in 2021 the improvement was due to more sponsor and online advertising activations resulting from the restart of live events and rapidly increasing ticket sales particularly in the united states 

as ticket sales and events scale up in key markets we continue to focus on mitigating the financial impact of the pandemic we are balancing our rampup with the costsavings initiatives we implemented across the organization and are also protecting our liquidity by managing cash outflows associated with all our major expenditures operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions and advances in both our ticketing and concert businesses the progress and momentum over the last three quarters has made us even more optimistic about the longterm potential of our company and the unique power of live shows to unite people 

impact of the global covid19 pandemic 

the unprecedented and rapid spread of covid19 and the related government restrictions and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world significantly impacted our business from midmarch through the first half of this year late in the second quarter however we began to see the positive impacts of successful vaccination rollouts in many of our key markets mainly the united states and united kingdom with social distancing restrictions easing and live events resuming in the third quarter we saw a meaningful restart of our operations with outdoor amphitheater events and festivals taking place in both the united states and united kingdom the restart of our operations has been executed with careful consideration for the safety and health of our fans artists and employees through a mix of masking testing and vaccination protocols at our events venues and offices around the world 

operating results 

the impact of the global covid19 pandemic to our operating results are discussed in part ii —financial information —item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 2—impact of the global covid19 pandemic 

cash and available liquidity 

we currently have approximately 5699 million available for future borrowings under our senior secured credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit in january 2021 we issued 500 million principal amount of 375 senior secured notes due 2028 and in september 2021 we elected to draw down the 400 million term loan a under the amended senior secured credit facility and completed the public offering of 5239259 shares of common stock for 4496 million of net proceeds we will continue to evaluate future financing opportunities to further expand liquidity at reasonable costs additionally our senior secured credit facility has reverted back to a net leverage covenant as defined in the agreement as of december 31 2021 we believe these additional debt and equity issuances allow us the flexibility to manage our business through the disruption that we continue to experience into 2022 

as of december 31 2021 our total cash and cash equivalents balance was 49 billion which included 13 billion of ticketing client cash we believe this cash net of client cash together with our available debt capacity of 5699 million gives us the liquidity to fund our operations during the pandemic our total cash includes eventrelated deferred revenue for which the amount can fluctuate over the course of the year but given the shift of shows into 2022 we expect this number to remain above seasonally normal levels throughout the first half of 2022 

eventrelated deferred revenue consists of cash held by our concerts business for future shows with roughly onethird of the funds associated with upcoming shows in the united states and twothirds for international shows as of december 31 2021 in the united states the funds are largely associated with shows in our owned or operated venues notably amphitheaters and theaters and clubs as well as festivals internationally the funds held are from a combination of both shows in our owned or operated venues as well as shows in thirdparty venues associated with our promoter share of tickets in allocation markets 

cost and cash management programs 

in response to the impacts the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our business globally we have implemented a number of initiatives to reduce fixed costs and conserve cash while our business was shut down as part of these cost reduction efforts in 2020 we implemented salary reductions for most of our employees with salaries for senior executives reduced by up to 60 additional cost reduction efforts that began in 2020 included hiring freezes reduction in the use of contractors rent renegotiations furloughs termination of certain employees and reduction or elimination of other discretionary spending including among other things travel and entertainment repairs and maintenance and marketing as of the end of 2021 salaries have been fully restored and furloughed employees have returned to work and as our business scales back up we are beginning to reinvest in our growth while continuing to closely monitor our cash flow and liquidity 

we continue to make use of government support programs globally in most european and asiapacific markets including the united kingdom germany italy france spain and australia there were payroll support programs to mitigate a substantial portion of employee costs additionally in the united states we filed for payroll support under the employee retention credit program established as part of the cares act which ended in the third quarter of 2021 finally the cares act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020 with 50 of the deferred amount due december 31 2021 and the remaining 50 due december 31 2022 

based on these actions and assumptions regarding the impact of the global covid19 pandemic we believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants throughout 2022 and be able to generate sufficient liquidity and profitability to satisfy our obligations for the next twelve months prior to giving effect to any additional financings that may occur our forecasted expense management and liquidity measures may be modified as we get more clarity on the timing of events we cannot assure you that our assumptions used to estimate our leverage liquidity and profitability requirements will be correct because the evolving nature of the pandemic makes its ultimate magnitude and duration unknown and as a consequence our ability to be predictive is uncertain 

health and safety and planning and executing a return to business 

we are currently implementing steps for the health and safety of our employees as they return to work in our offices in the future and for our artists and fans as they return to live events we are returning to work in local markets in appropriate numbers with expanded cleaning and in compliance with any social distancing or other regulations similarly we are resuming concerts when the time is right on a market by market basis we recognize that as concerts have started back up the experience at our venues has changed and are working with medical experts and public health officials to implement safety precautions and protocols necessary for fans to return to enjoy our shows the reopening of concerts is happening on a market by market basis and given that we operate in 45 countries globally the timelines will vary from now to not for several months or beyond and changing conditions may cause reopened markets to again close down in the future 

as the leading global live event and ticketing company we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues as business resumes more than twenty years of ongoing global growth demonstrates the resilience of fan demand for the live entertainment experience 

segment overview 

concerts 

revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year if a current year event is rescheduled into a future year all advertising costs incurred to date are expensed in the period when the event is rescheduled 

concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees event production costs showrelated marketing and advertising expenses along with other costs 

to judge the health of our concerts segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events and fan attendance in our network of owned or operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance market ticket pricing advance ticket sales and the number of major artist clients under management in addition at our owned or operated venues and festivals we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates

ticketing direct operating expenses include call center costs and credit card fees along with other costs 

to judge the health of our ticketing segment we primarily review the gtv and the number of tickets sold through our ticketing operations the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services in addition we review the number of visits to our websites cost of customer acquisition the purchase conversion rate the overall number of customers in our database the number and percentage of tickets sold via mobile and the number of app installs for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates

revenue related to sponsorship and advertising programs is recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor unless the revenue is associated with a specific event in which case it is recognized when the event occurs 

sponsorship  advertising direct operating expenses include fulfillment costs related to our sponsorship programs along with other costs 

to judge the health of our sponsorship  advertising segment we primarily review the revenue generated through sponsorship arrangements and online advertising and the percentage of expected revenue under contract for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

key operating metrics 

  

1 events generally represent a single performance by an artist fans generally represent the number of people who attend an event festivals are counted as one event in the quarter in which the festival begins but the number of fans is based on the days the fans were present at the festival and thus can be reported across multiple quarters events and fan attendance metrics are estimated each quarter 

2 the feebearing tickets estimated above include primary and secondary tickets that are sold using our ticketmaster systems or that we issue through affiliates this metric includes primary tickets sold during the year regardless of event timing except for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing which are reported when the events occur the nonfeebearing tickets estimated above include primary tickets sold using our ticketmaster systems through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices along with tickets sold on our “do it yourself” platform these ticketing metrics are net of any refunds requested and any cancellations that occurred during the period and up to the time of reporting of these consolidated financial statements feebearing tickets sold above are net of refunds of 210 million and 273 million tickets for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

nongaap measures 

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of aoi to operating income loss 

adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before certain stockbased compensation expense loss gain on disposal of operating assets depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment amortization of nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances and acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration obligations and acquisitionrelated severance and compensation  we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

aoi margin 

aoi margin is a nongaap financial measure that we calculate by dividing aoi by revenue we use aoi margin to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi margin assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi margin is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi margin as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi margin should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss margin and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

constant currency 

constant currency is a nongaap financial measure we calculate currency impacts as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations

our ticketing segment operating results were and discussions of significant variances are as follows 

 

revenue

operating results 

ticketing operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 was 1703 million as compared to an operating loss of 6120 million for the prior year primarily driven by the increased ticketing activity discussed above along with cost reduction measures implemented in the second quarter of 2020 continuing into 2021 including salary reductions hiring freezes furloughs and reduction or elimination of other discretionary spending along with participation in government support programs globally

interest expense 

interest expense increased 556 million or 25 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year due to additional interest costs from the issuance of our 20 convertible senior notes in february 2020 the issuance of our 65 senior secured notes in may 2020 the issuance of our 375 senior secured notes in january 2021 and the draw down of our term loan a under the amended senior secured credit facility

loss gain from sale of investments in nonconsolidated affiliates

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was an income of 421 million during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to loss of 1033 million in the prior year primarily due to higher operating results from certain concert and festival promotion businesses in north america during 2021 due to the resumption of events in 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

in response to the impact that the global covid19 pandemic has had on our business and the uncertainty of the duration of current conditions globally we have taken certain actions to strengthen our liquidity position and preserve our capital resources 

in april 2020 we amended our senior secured credit facility to provide an incremental 130 million revolving credit facility we further amended our senior secured credit facility in july 2020 which among other things substitutes our net leverage covenant with a 500 million liquidity covenant as defined in the agreement until the earlier of a december 31 2021 and b at our election any fiscal quarter prior to december 31 2021 in february 2020 we issued 400 million principal amount of 20 convertible senior notes due 2025 and in may 2020 we issued 12 billion principal amount of 65 senior secured notes due 2027 in january 2021 we issued 500 million principal amount of 375 senior secured notes due 2028 and in september 2021 we elected to draw down the 400 million term loan a under the amended senior secured credit facility and completed the public offering of 5239259 shares of common stock for 4496 million of net proceeds as a result we believe these amendments and additional debt and equity issuances will allow us the flexibility to manage our business through the disruption we continue to experience into 2022 

our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be 

from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 49 billion at december 31 2021 and 25 billion at december 31 2020 included in the december 31 2021 and 2020 cash and cash equivalents balances are 13 billion and 6735 million respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges which we refer to as client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 15 billion in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2021 

we generally do not repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 57 billion and 49 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes was 42 at december 31 2021 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in noninterestbearing and interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets including those resulting from the global covid19 pandemic 

for our concerts segment we often receive cash related to ticket revenue in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs in the united states this cash is largely associated with events in our owned or operated venues notably amphitheaters festivals theaters and clubs internationally this cash is from a combination of both events in our owned or operated venues as well as events in thirdparty venues associated with our promoter’s share of tickets in allocation markets with the exception of some upfront costs and artist advances which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event artists are paid when the event occurs under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits net of any advance they have received when an event is cancelled any cash held in deferred revenue is reclassified to accrued expenses as those funds are typically refunded to the fan within 30 days of event cancellation in certain markets we are offering fans an incentive to receive a voucher for a future ticket purchase to one of our events in lieu of receiving a refund for a cancelled event where a fan has elected to receive the incentive voucher the cash from the original ticket purchase remains in deferred revenue when a show is rescheduled fans have the ability to request a refund if they do not want to attend the event on the new date although historically we have had low levels of refund requests for rescheduled events 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaid expenses this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions pay artist advances and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts segment which reports the majority of its revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions including those resulting from the global covid19 pandemic we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreement consists of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets including those resulting from the global covid19 pandemic should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should the counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreement default on its obligation we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals for amounts incurred but not yet paid for but net of expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords and noncontrolling interest partners or replacements funded by insurance proceeds consisted of the following 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2021 increased from the same period of the prior year primarily due to leasehold improvements of certain venuerelated projects 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2021 decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower spending in our amphitheater venues and a reduction in technologyrelated projects as part of our cash savings initiatives implemented in connection with the global covid19 pandemic 

for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 59 million 179 million and 220 million respectively of insurance proceeds and landlord or noncontrolling interest partner reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 375 million for the year ending december 31 2022 

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

we have future cash obligations for our debt obligations and operating lease liabilities we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance information regarding our scheduled maturities of our outstanding debt obligations excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs and operating lease liabilities can be found in part ii—financial information—item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 6—longterm debt and —note 5—leases respectively 

we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantees and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work information regarding our minimum payments for noncancelable contracts and capital expenditures commitments can be found in part ii—financial information—item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 9—commitments and contingent liabilities as of december 31 2021 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the estimated interest payments expected payments of contingent and deferred consideration liabilities as of december 31 2021 are as follows 

 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 208 million and 121 million respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards obligations of a nonconsolidated affiliate and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to cash used in operating activities of 11 billion for the prior year primarily due to increases in accounts payable client accounts and accrued expenses resulting from the resumption of events in certain markets late in the second quarter of 2021 along with a reduction of net loss year over year partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities increased 3429 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the ocesa acquisition see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities decreased 1788 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net proceeds in 2020 from debt issuances partially offset by proceeds from the sale of common stock and lower purchases of noncontrolling interests in 2021 see “—sources of cash” above for further discussion 

seasonality 

information regarding the seasonality of our business can be found in part ii—financial information—item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—the company and summary of significant accounting policies 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary’s functional currency as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not have significant operations in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported an operating loss of 1769 million for the year ended december 31 2021 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 by 177 million as of december 31 2021 our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar canadian dollar and mexican peso this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities in addition the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2021 we had forward currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of 1004 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 58 billion of total debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs outstanding as of december 31 2021 of the total amount we had 50 billion of fixedrate debt and 08 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2021 each 25basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 19 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2021 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

in january 2020 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis the swap agreement expires in october 2026 has a notional amount of 5000 million and ensures that a portion of our floatingrate debt does not exceed 3397 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements can be found in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—the company and summary of significant accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for at fair value unless the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value in which case the investment is accounted for at cost less any impairment intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projections of operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 

when performing quantitative assessments for impairment of our definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of those assets or asset group if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset or asset group is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have six reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts north america concerts artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the concerts segment sponsorship  advertising and global ticketing 

we test goodwill for impairment in any period when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our reporting units we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process the first step of the process is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment we also considered changes in discount rates market multiples carrying value and forecast since the last quantitative test 

if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years to support our annual qualitative first step this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment and measure the impairment if any compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recorded as an impairment to goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative the reporting unit passes the impairment test in this case we will disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and disclose which reportable segment the reporting unit is included in 

in both steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants generally we test for sensitivity to changes in discount rates revenue and terminal growth rates and market multiples 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a discounted cash flow or a market multiple methodology or a combination thereof the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples used on projected future cash flows and market participant acquisition premium a market participant acquisition premium represents the additional value a buyer would pay to obtain control of the respective reporting unit because having control would lead to higher cash flows lower cost of capital or both in 2021 as part of the october 1 annual review market multiples were not incorporated into our assessments for some reporting units where its current financial metrics do not support use of the market approach as a corroborating approach when these businesses stabilize we will reincorporate the market approach into their fair value methodology 

in 2021 as part of our annual impairment test all of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the initial qualitative evaluation and did not advance to the second step considerations included a excess of fair values over carrying values in the most recent quantitative analysis performed b discount rates c financial results and d sensitivity analyses we also considered changes in discount rates market multiples if applicable carrying value and forecasts since the last time a quantitative test was performed 

given the results of the tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion or production of an event is recognized when the show occurs revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorship agreements which is not related to a single event is classified as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of our share of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold in either the primary or secondary markets we act as an agent on behalf of our clients and therefore do not record the face value of the tickets as revenue for tickets sold for our concert and festival events where our concert promoters control ticketing revenue is recognized when the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges are shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events of our thirdparty clients and secondary market sales this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states state taxes and foreign withholding or transaction taxes on those foreign earnings that would be incurred if they were distributed it is not practicable to determine the amount of state and foreign income taxes if any that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement

 item 1   business 

impact of the global covid19 pandemic 

the unprecedented and rapid spread of covid19 and the related government restrictions and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world have significantly impacted our live event business we initially saw event restrictions in asia and parts of europe beginning in march 2020 large public events were cancelled governmental authorities began imposing restrictions on nonessential activities and businesses suspended activities around the world as the impact of the global covid19 pandemic became clearer we ceased all live nation tours and closed our venues in midmarch 2020 to support global efforts at social distancing and mitigating the virus and to comply with restrictions put in place by various governmental entities which has had a materially negative impact on our revenue and financial position 

operating results 

our annual results were materially impacted by these necessary actions our overall revenue for the year decreased by 84 to 19 billion the revenue reduction was across all of our segments as a result of few shows occurring globally beginning in the last half of march 2020 and low ticket sales for future shows during the same period along with the impact of ticket refunds and show cancellations our operating results for the year decreased as compared to 2019 largely due to the global covid19 pandemic impacts to our business to a loss for the year of 17 billion including 275 million of impairment charges for 2020 

the revenue recognized in our concerts segment in 2020 included the results of all the shows that occurred prior to the stoppage of events in midmarch our eventrelated deferred revenue for concerts which is reported as part of deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets includes the face value and concerts’ share of service charges for all tickets sold by december 31 2020 for shows expected to occur in the next 12 months any refunds committed to for shows cancelled or rescheduled during the year have either been returned to fans or are reflected in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets in addition we have recorded an estimate of 1020 million in concerts for refunds that may occur in the future for shows we believe may be cancelled or rescheduled based on the limited amount of data available on refunds resulting from the global shutdown of our live events this estimate only impacts our financial position as a reclassification from deferred revenue or other longterm liabilities to accrued expenses we expect that the majority of our shows postponed due to the pandemic will be rescheduled eventrelated deferred revenue for tickets sold for shows expected to occur after december 31 2021 totaled 35 million and is reflected in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

the revenue recognized in our ticketing segment in 2020 includes our share of ticket service charges for tickets sold during the period for thirdparty clients and for shows that occurred in the period for our concerts business where our promoters control the ticketing revenue in the period has been reduced by refunds given during the period in addition revenue has been reduced for any shows that were cancelled and for refunds requested on rescheduled shows up to the time of the filing of these consolidated financial statements and funds have either been returned to the customer or are reflected in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets our ticketing clients determine if shows will be rescheduled or cancelled and what the refund policy will be for those shows we have not recorded an estimate for refunds that may occur in the future since our clients not ticketmaster determine when shows are cancelled or rescheduled and we have a limited amount of historical data of refunds resulting from a global shutdown of live events on which to reliably determine an estimate by the end of 2020 and through the time of this filing ticketing had processed or accrued for cancellations or refunds on 274 million tickets 

for events that are cancelled our standard policy is to refund the fan within 30 days though subject to regulations in various markets and in some cases at the discretion of venue or event organizer clients our ticket refund policies for rescheduled shows vary by ticketing client and country in multiple international markets including germany italy and belgium governmental regulations which allow for the issuance of vouchers in place of cash refunds for rescheduled shows and in some cases for cancelled shows have been put in place in response to the global covid19 pandemic the volume and pace of cash refunds has had and may continue to have a material negative effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

the length and severity of the reduction in live events due to the pandemic is uncertain accordingly we currently expect the negative impact to continue in 2021 the exact timing and pace of the recovery is uncertain given the significant impact of the pandemic and the uncertainty on the timing of the roll out of vaccines on the overall united states and global economies we believe the ongoing effects of the global covid19 pandemic on our operations have had and will continue to have a material negative impact on our financial results and liquidity and such negative impact may continue beyond the containment of such outbreak we have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our live events or a largescale reduction in the number of events selling tickets and as a consequence our ability to be predictive regarding the impact of these circumstances is uncertain and we are unable to estimate the impact on our business financial condition or near or longerterm financial or operational results 

cash and available liquidity 

we amended our senior secured credit facility in april 2020 and further amended it in july 2020 which among other things substitutes our net leverage covenant under our senior secured credit facility with a 500 million liquidity covenant as defined in the agreement until the earlier of a december 31 2021 and b at our election any fiscal quarter prior to december 31 2021 these amendments will allow us the flexibility to manage our business through the disruption that we experienced in 2020 and expect to experience in 2021 

in addition we added a new incremental revolving credit facility of 130 million extending our undrawn debt capacity following this increase we currently have approximately 9617 million in available debt capacity including 400 million in undrawn term loan a capacity and 5617 million in available revolver capacity net of outstanding letters of credit in addition in february 2020 we issued 400 million principal amount of 20 convertible senior notes due 2025 and in may 2020 we issued 12 billion principal amount of 65 senior secured notes due 2027 in january 2021 we issued 500 million principal amount of 375 senior secured notes due 2028 we will continue to evaluate future financing opportunities to further expand liquidity at reasonable costs 

as of december 31 2020 our total cash and cash equivalents balance was 25 billion which included 6735 million of ticketing client cash we believe this cash net of client cash together with our available debt capacity of 9617 million gives us the liquidity to fund our operations during the pandemic our total cash includes eventrelated deferred revenue for which the amount can fluctuate over the course of the year but given the shift of shows into 2021 we expect this number to remain above seasonally normal levels throughout the first half of 2021 

eventrelated deferred revenue consists of cash held by our concerts business for future shows with roughly half the funds associated with upcoming shows in the united states and half for international shows as of december 31 2020 in the united states the funds are largely associated with shows in our owned or operated venues notably amphitheaters festivals theaters and clubs internationally the funds held are from a combination of both shows in our owned or operated venues as well as shows in thirdparty venues associated with our promoter share of tickets in allocation markets we do not otherwise generally hold funds for concerts being held in thirdparty buildings in the united states venues traditionally hold all funds and internationally either the venue holds all funds or holds the portion of funds associated with their ticket allocation 

cost and cash management programs 

given the uncertainty associated with the duration of current conditions globally we have implemented a number of initiatives to reduce fixed costs and conserve cash as part of these cost reduction efforts we have implemented salary reductions for most of our employees with salaries for senior executives reduced by up to 60 during 2020 additional cost reduction efforts include hiring freezes reduction in the use of contractors rent renegotiations furloughs termination of certain employees and reduction or elimination of other discretionary spending including among other things travel and entertainment repairs and maintenance and marketing 

we are also making use of government support programs globally in most european and asian markets including the united kingdom germany italy france spain and australia there were payroll support programs to mitigate a substantial portion of employee costs some of which are continuing into 2021 additionally in the united states we have filed for payroll support under the employee retention credit program established as part of the 2020 cares act finally the cares act also provides for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020 with 50 of the deferred amount due december 31 2021 and the remaining 50 due december 31 2022 

we are further protecting our cash outflows by reducing advances in both our ticketing and concert businesses reassessing all capital expenditure projects and evaluating all other cash deployment activities as a result of these initiatives and government support programs we achieved over 950 million in cost reductions in 2020 and the elimination or deferral into 2021 of 16 billion in cash outflows which primarily includes the cost reductions discussed above along with lower capital expenditures acquisition payments and concert and ticketing advances we believe this aggressive cost and cash management program combined with a strong liquidity profile positions us to manage through the global covid19 pandemicrelated hold on show activity and provides the flexibility to scale up quickly when shows restart 

based on these actions and assumptions regarding the impact of the global covid19 pandemic we believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants throughout 2021 and be able to generate sufficient liquidity to satisfy our obligations for the next twelve months prior to giving effect to any additional financings that may occur our forecasted expense management and liquidity measures may be modified as we get more clarity on the timing of events we cannot assure you that our assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements will be correct because we have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our live events and the magnitude duration and speed of the global pandemic is unknown and as a consequence our ability to be predictive is uncertain 

health and safety and planning for a return to business 

we are currently planning for the health and safety of our employees as they return to work in our offices in the future and for our artists and fans as they return to live events we will return to work in local markets only after there is clear guidance that the time is right to do so and then in appropriate numbers with expanded cleaning and any social distancing or other regulations similarly we are planning for the resumption of concerts when the time is right we will let the facts and science tell us when we should start putting on concerts again we recognize the experience at our venues will change when concerts start back up and are working with medical experts and public health officials to implement safety precautions and protocols necessary for fans to return to enjoy our shows recent fan surveys indicate that the demand will be there when the shows return with 95 of fans expecting to attend concerts again once the pandemic is over we expect the reopening of concerts will happen on a market by market basis and given we operate in 46 countries globally the timelines will vary from now to not for several months or beyond the length and severity of the impact to live events and our related sponsorship and ticketing businesses is still uncertain we currently do not anticipate a significant change in activity levels until early in the second half of 2021 we expect that most global tours will resume and larger venues will reopen in the second half of 2021 and that the underlying business will begin generating operating income once again 

while this disruption has had a material impact on our business as the leading global live event and ticketing company we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues once business resumes twenty years of global growth demonstrates the resilience of fan demand for the live entertainment experience we are actively taking steps to ensure that when the time is right for us to do so we will be ready to ramp back up quickly and once again connect audiences to artists at the concerts they are looking forward to

our industry 

we operate in the following main industries within the live entertainment business live music events music venue operations the provision of management and other services to artists and athletes ticketing services and sponsorship and advertising sales 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then work with promoters who will contract with them or with artists directly to arrange events promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees artist managers primarily provide services to music artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise parking and premium seating 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting its fee venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets 

ticketing resale services generally refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally obtained the tickets from a venue or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket resale company is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand product or service these sponsorships typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as credit card beverage travel and telecommunications and may include event presales and onsite product activation 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts  our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists including intersegment revenue our concerts business generated 15 billion or 789 of our total revenue during 2020 we promoted more than 8000 live music and other events in 2020 while our concerts segment operates yearround traditionally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october due to the unprecedented stoppage of our concert events globally in midmarch due to the worldwide covid19 pandemic we did not promote our usual number of shows or experience our typical seasonality trends in 2020 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we promote we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with limited associated direct operating expenses revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival promoter we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees and service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a portion of the service charge as its fee we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers during 2020 we sold 41 54 4 and 1 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings including intersegment revenue our ticketing business generated 1884 million or 101 of our total revenue during 2020 which excludes the face value of tickets sold and is net of the fees paid to our ticketing clients through all of our ticketing services we sold 31 million tickets in 2020 on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 89 million tickets were sold using our ticketmaster systems including through season seat packages our venue clients’ box offices and other channels through which we did not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well due to the unprecedented stoppage of live events globally in midmarch or reduction in the number of fans in attendance due to the worldwide covid19 pandemic we did not sell our usual number of tickets in 2020 

we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be sometimes with our guidance and recommendations agreements with venue clients in north america and australia generally grant us exclusive rights to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients in other international markets generally grant us the right to an allocation of tickets for events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider similarly in such international markets we have venue agreements which provide ticketmaster an allocation of tickets for all events at those venues while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute a portion of their tickets inhouse through their box office and season ticket programs in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients and generally subject to ticketmaster approval the client may allocate certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and not make those tickets available for sale by us due to these and other permitted thirdparty ticket distribution channels we do not always sell all of our clients’ tickets even at venues where we are the exclusive primary ticketing service provider and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and also varies as to any given client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing principally through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally we enter into arrangements with the holders of tickets previously distributed by a venue or other source to post those tickets for sale at a purchase price equal to a new sales price determined by the ticket holder plus a service fee to the buyer the seller in this circumstance receives the new sales price less a seller service fee 

sponsorship  advertising  our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert festival venue and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically presented exclusively to the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets including intersegment revenue our sponsorship  advertising business generated 2037 million or 109 of our total revenue during 2020 we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through october due to the unprecedented stoppage of our concert events globally in midmarch due to the global covid19 pandemic we did not recognize our normal amount of sponsorship revenue or experience our typical seasonality trends in 2020 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and festivals and to arrange multivenue or multifestival branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of client companies across various industry categories 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 

• stadiums —stadiums are multipurpose facilities often housing local sports teams stadiums typically have 30000 or more seats although they are the largest venues available for live music they are not specifically designed for live music 

• amphitheaters —amphitheaters are generally outdoor venues with between 5000 and 30000 seats that are used primarily in the summer season we believe they are popular because they are designed specifically for concert events with premium seat packages and better lines of sight and acoustics 

• arenas —arenas are indoor venues that are used as multipurpose facilities often housing local sports teams arenas typically have between 5000 and 20000 seats because they are indoors they are able to offer amenities that other similarsized outdoor venues cannot such as luxury suites and premium club memberships as a result we believe they are popular for higherpriced concerts aimed at audiences willing to pay for these amenities 

• theaters —theaters are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may include theatrical performances these venues typically have a capacity of between 1000 and 6500 theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriatelysized venue for developing artists and more artists in general because these venues have a smaller capacity than an amphitheater or arena they do not offer as much economic upside on a per show basis theaters can also be used yearround 

• clubs —clubs are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may also include comedy clubs these venues typically have a capacity of less than 1000 and often without full fixed seating because of their small size they do not offer as much economic upside but they also represent less risk to a concert promoter because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and also may provide a more appropriatelysized venue for developing artists clubs can also be used yearround 

• restaurants  music halls —restaurants  music halls are indoor venues that offer customers an integrated live music entertainment and dining experience this category includes our house of blues ® and brooklyn bowl ® venues whose live music halls are specially designed to provide optimum acoustics and typically can accommodate between 1000 to 2000 guests a fullservice restaurant and bar is located adjacent to the live music hall we believe that the strength of the brand and the quality of the food service and unique atmosphere in our restaurants attract customers to these venues independently from a live music event and generate a significant amount of repeat business from local customers 

• festival sites —festival sites are outdoor locations used primarily in the summer season to stage large singleday or multiday concert events featuring several artists on multiple stages depending on the location festival site capacities can range from 10000 to over 100000 fans per day we believe they are popular because of the value provided to the fan by packaging several artists together for an event while festival sites only host a few events each year they can provide higher operating income because we are able to generate income from many different services provided at the event 

• other venues —other venues includes restaurants and exhibition halls that typically are not used for live music events 

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2020 



 

1 operated festival sites includes multiyear agreements providing us the right to use public or private land for a defined period of time leading up to and continuing after the festival we may enter into multiple agreements for a single festival site or use the same site for multiple festivals we have aggregated the agreements for each festival site and reported them as one festival site 

2 venues in operation includes our venues that were closed temporarily beginning in midmarch 2020 due to the global covid19 pandemic 

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

• the quality of service delivered to our artists fans ticketing clients and corporate sponsors 

• our track record and reputation in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally 

• our artist relationships 

• our global footprint 

• the quality of our ticketing software and services 

• our ecommerce site and its extensive database 

• our diverse distribution platform of venues 

• the scope effectiveness and expertise of our advertising and sponsorship programs and 

• our financial stability 

although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or greater financial marketing technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music promotion industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg another planet entertainment jam productions ltd and imp in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in north america europe asia and australia aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg presents concerts west frontier touring goldenvoice and messina touring group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include asm global madison square garden entertainment corp the nederlander organization and bowery presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america europe australia and new zealand some of our competitors in venue management may have more attractive or a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through telephone and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase it has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services have created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale notwithstanding federal and state prohibitions the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events 

we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc cts eventim ag eventbrite etix ticketfly and seatgeek secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub vivid seats ticketnetwork viagogo and seatgeek and many others including large technology and ecommerce companies that we understand have recently entered or could enter these markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues strong brand association and attractive local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 

• privacy and the protection of personal or sensitive information 

• compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries 

• primary ticketing and ticket resale services

• hazardous and nonhazardous waste and other environmental protection laws 

• sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes 

• marketing activities via the telephone and online and 

• historic landmark rules 

we believe that we are materially in compliance with these laws 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world including the european union’s gdpr as defined and discussed below in item 1a—risk factors and the recentlyenacted california consumer protection act 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

from time to time federal state local and international authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws particularly as related to primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

the regulations relating to our food service operations in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol some jurisdictions have also proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues

our compensation philosophy is focused on attracting and retaining talented individuals who contribute to our values and help lead our dynamic and innovative environment to determine marketcompetitive pay for our employees we use a combination of entertainment and technology industry benchmarks 

we are committed to encouraging and rewarding payforperformance that is aligned with business objectives in the best interest of our shareholders for longterm growth and profitability we further strive to reward individual achievements and contributions that are both aligned with and supportive of our short and longterm goals and core business values we believe that our efforts in these areas are working and contributing to the overall success of the company as evidenced by accolades such as obtaining a great place to work® certification 201719 placing fourth on indeeds list of the worlds 50 best workplaces 2019 placing third on fast company’s most innovative companies list for the music sector 2019 and our inclusion on forbes’ best employers for diversity list 2019 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 8200 fulltime employees including those on furlough due to the interruption in our business from the pandemic during regular operational times our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ seasonal and parttime employees primarily for our live music venues and festivals at the end of 2019 prior to the pandemic we employed approximately 15400 seasonal and parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 28000 seasonal and parttime employees in 2019 

labor relations 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we have good relationships with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage and our common stock if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to the covid19 pandemic 

the global covid19 pandemic has had and is likely to continue to have a material negative impact on our business and operating results the ultimate magnitude of this impact will depend on a variety of factors including the duration of the pandemic restrictions or new operational requirements in place or that result as our operations recommence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis the state of the global economy as a result of the pandemic and the public’s willingness to attend events with large numbers of people all of which are unknowable at this time 

in midmarch 2020 as the unprecedented impact of the global covid19 pandemic became clearer we ceased all live nation tours and closed our venues to support global efforts at social distancing and mitigating the spread of the virus and to comply with restrictions put in place by various governmental entities other concert promoters venue operators and sports leagues around the globe similarly shut down each of our segments—concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising—depends on live music and sporting events in order to generate most of its revenue as of the date of this report certain sports leagues have recommenced but they have largely done so without fans or at greatly reduced capacity and thus without the typical need for ticketing there has also been extremely limited concert activity largely outside of the united states at reduced capacity until such time as fans are allowed at sporting events at capacity and concerts recommence in a meaningful way our revenue will be minimal the possibility exists that these circumstances might continue for a longer period of time than current expectations 

we have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our live music operations and as a result our ability to gauge the impact of such a cessation on our company and its future prospects is uncertain due to the unprecedented nature of the global covid19 pandemic and its impacts on our business our ability to forecast our cash inflows is hampered and therefore our focus is on forecasting and managing operating costs and cash outflows against our overall liquidity position at this time it is impossible to know or predict when events will once again be held at a meaningful scope and scale as at the outset of the pandemic national and local governments around the world placed various restrictions on gatherings of people and implemented social distancing requirements that prohibit the holding of these events and have largely not relaxed these restrictions in a way that would again allow such events in addition it is currently unclear as to what restrictions will be placed on events once they recommence at various points in time in the 46 countries in which we operate 

the company faces ancillary risks and uncertainties arising from the global covid19 pandemic in addition to the current shutdown of its revenuegenerating operations many of these risks and uncertainties are more fully described below in this item 1a whether or not such risk factors identify the global covid19 pandemic as the underlying cause and many extend beyond the duration of the current shutdown due to the uncertainty as to how the live music and sporting industries and the world in general will change in the short and long term as a result of the pandemic the risks and uncertainties described herein should be read in conjunction with those set forth below such additional or attendant risks and uncertainties include among other things 

• the impact of any lingering economic downturn or recession resulting from the pandemic including without limitation any reduction in discretionary spending or confidence for both consumers and sponsorsadvertisers such as a decline in ticket sales attendance and revenue that the company has generally avoided in prior economic slowdowns but experienced during and after the global financial crisis in 2010 

• the increased risk of litigation in the current and future environment such as pending lawsuits challenging aspects of the company’s ticket refund policies and procedures 

• a reduction in the profitability of our operations when concerts resume whether due to increased operating costs of complying with governmental restrictions or safety precautions and protocols voluntarily undertaken such as the need to supply personal protective equipment or conduct health screenings at points of ingress or due to a reduction in revenue arising from such precautions such as the potential that venues may not be able to be filled to capacity due to spacing and social distancing limitations in place at such time 

• the impact on our workforce including as a result of employee furloughs as part of our costsavings initiatives which may include loss of key personnel as furloughed employees find other employment or choose not to return to the company lowered employee morale inability to replace hourlyseasonal workforce or loss of important subcontractors all of which may negatively impact our ability to quickly capitalize on opportunities as pandemic restrictions are eased or to conduct our operations in the future 

• potential decreased willingness of artists to tour or impracticability of touring due to varying restrictions from jurisdiction to jurisdiction including the possibility that national or subnational borders are closed to travel 

• potential changes to consumer preferences for consumption of live music or sporting events due to fears of or restrictions on large gatherings 

• some customers of our ticketing business may not receive refunds for ticket purchases if the venueclient hosting the impacted event is unable or unwilling to return the funds 

• loss of ticketing clients due to the economic impacts of the pandemic whereby they are no longer in operation reducing the number of events to which our ticketing business can sell tickets 

• the inability to pursue expansion opportunities or acquisitions due to capital constraints 

• the future availability or increased cost of insurance coverage 

• a potential shift away from live events by sponsors and advertisers and 

• the incurrence of additional expenses related to compliance precautions and management of our company during and after this period 

the likelihood of the realization or intensification of these risks and uncertainties and the ultimate magnitude of their impact on the company are not knowable or quantifiable at this time the global covid19 pandemic and its impacts may continue to endure for an unknown period of time in addition as has already occurred in various locations the potential exists for further waves of the pandemic after the current wave of infections subsides which may lead to stronger restrictions being put into place for a greater duration of time different jurisdictions will lift social distancing guidelines and restrictions on gatherings of people at different times and will have different rules in place thereafter the longer the duration of the global covid19 pandemic and the greater the ancillary and lingering effects the greater the material negative impact on the company and its results of operations will be while vaccination programs have begun around the world we are still at the early stages and the ultimate impact of such programs on the pandemic and its duration and thus on our business are unknown 

in addition due to the reduction in cash flows we have experienced and are likely to experience in the future from the global covid19 pandemic we have proactively taken a number of steps to enhance our liquidity position including our costsavings and cash management programs described in item 8—financial statements—note 2—impact of the global covid19 pandemic the additional debt issuances and the amendments we made to our senior secured credit facility described in item 8—financial statements—note 5—longterm debt 

our decreased cash flows have heightened and intensified the risks described under the “risks relating to our leverage” section of the risk factors in this report while amendments to our senior secured credit facility have relieved some of the pressure on the consolidated net leverage covenant therein which requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the credit agreement there can be no assurances that we will remain in compliance with this or other covenants in our debt and credit instruments or that we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments in order to avoid default 

we will continue to evaluate and explore additional mechanisms to attempt to ensure that we have adequate capital to fund our business including through the issuance and sale of additional debt or equity securities the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral which may further restrict our business operations or be unavailable due to our covenant restrictions then in effect due to potential liquidity concerns caused by the global covid19 pandemic in march and august 2020 moody’s downgraded our corporate family ratings and in may 2020 sp downgraded the company’s credit ratings to b with a negative outlook the likelihood that we may experience further negative credit actions increases the longer the duration of the pandemic and its ancillary effects there is no guarantee that debt financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations additionally the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on the financial markets could adversely impact our ability to raise funds 

risks relating to our business and the live events and ticketing industries 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our concerts business would be adversely affected our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including music artists as some agreements between a manager and an artist are not for a fixed period of time and are instead terminable at will 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consists primarily of our portion of per ticket convenience charges and per order service fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music and ticketing industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us which could negatively impact our financial results our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve within the live music industry our artist management business also competes with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone both to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists across the live music industry it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season and subscription sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the federal trade commission “ftc” the attorneys general of several individual states and various international governing bodies these restrictions include a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to a resale website owned or controlled by us is posted that the link is directing the user to a resale website and that ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances disclose when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements there are certain state laws that now ban such ticket listings and the new york attorney general has brought a lawsuit against resale companies for these practices 

other variables related to the competitive environment that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

• an increased level of competition for advertising dollars which may lead to lower sponsorships as we attempt to retain advertisers or which may cause us to lose advertisers to our competitors offering better programs that we are unable or unwilling to match 

• unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs including increased guarantees to artists which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via higher ticket prices 

• inability or unwillingness to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses due to insufficient cash on hand or capacity under our senior secured credit facility which could result in the loss of key tours to competitors or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 

• competitors’ offerings that may include more favorable terms than we do in order to obtain agreements for new venues or ticketing arrangements or to obtain events for the venues they operate 

• technological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees and 

• other entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer 

our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment levels fuel prices interest rates changes in tax rates and tax laws that impact companies or individuals and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions and public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

• construction of live music venues may result in cost overruns delays or unanticipated expenses 

• desirable sites for live music venues may be unavailable or costly and 

• the attractiveness of our venue locations may deteriorate over time 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have occurred and may in the future occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation in addition while we have security protocols in place at our events illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity adverse consequences including illness injury or death to the persons engaged in such activities or others and litigation against us while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events increased weather variability due to climate change exacerbates weatherrelated issues we face due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

risks relating to information technology cybersecurity and intellectual property 

the success of our ticketing business and other operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as well as affiliate and thirdparty computer systems computer networks and other communication systems system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructure may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructure both of our own ticketing systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and thirdparty software computer networks and other communications systems service providers on which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war or human error in addition the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions the large infrastructure plant that is required to operate our systems requires an ongoing investment of time money and effort to maintain or refresh hardware and software and to ensure it remains at a level capable of servicing the demand and volume of business that ticketmaster receives failure to do so may result in system instability degradation in performance or unfixable security vulnerabilities that could adversely impact both the business and the consumers utilizing our services 

while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights 

due to the nature of our business we process store use transfer and disclose certain personal or sensitive information about our customers and employees penetration of our network or other misappropriation or misuse of personal or sensitive information and data including credit card information and other personally identifiable information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation inquiries and actions from governmental authorities and financial or other liabilities in addition security breaches incidents or the inability to protect information could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches and incidents could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and could result in significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer and employee information and to prevent security breaches or incidents which could result in data loss or other harm or loss such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities new variants of malware the development of new penetration methods and tools inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of customer or employee information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer and employee information the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may change frequently and as a result may be difficult for our business to detect for long periods of time in addition despite our best efforts we may be unaware of or unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches incidents and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will continue to do so in the future 

we also face risks associated with security breaches and incidents affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business in particular hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture andor may pose a security risk that could unexpectedly compromise information security for example in the second quarter of 2018 we became aware that a thirdparty customer support product used in certain jurisdictions outside the us was infected with a malicious code that may have allowed an unauthorized party to skim customers’ personal or payment information from their browsers while we acted promptly to disable the infected thirdparty product we continue to review our systems and interface with regulatory authorities as a result of this incident these include proceedings contesting a proposed fine issued by the united kingdom’s “uk” information commissioner’s office in november 2020 against ticketmaster uk limited in connection with this incident consumers are generally concerned with the security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal state and international laws we have expended significant capital and other resources to keep abreast of the evolving privacy landscape including the establishment of a dedicated global privacy organization within our legal team however our business could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or policies including for example practices or policies regarding the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement legislation or regulations in a manner which negatively affects our business financial condition andor results of operations due to the changes in the data privacy regulatory environment we may incur additional costs and challenges to our business that restrict or limit our ability to collect transfer use disclose secure or retain personal or sensitive information these changes in data privacy laws may require us to modify our current or future products services programs practices or policies which may in turn impact the products and services available to our customers 

regulators and government enforcement actions worldwide are imposing significant fines against companies for data privacy violations our business operations including our ticketing business involve the collection transfer use disclosure security and disposal of personal or sensitive information in various locations around the world including the european union “eu” where the general data protection regulation “gdpr” governs data privacy and can result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties in addition following the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the eu on december 31 2020 we must separately comply with the uk’s data protection law under which additional fines and penalties could be imposed independent of the gdpr the relationship between uk data protection law and the gdpr remains unclear including regarding how data transfers between the eu and uk will be treated these changes could lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk 

as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions the costs associated with compliance with applicable local data privacy laws and regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes andor make changes to our products services and operations which will increase operational cost and risk 

our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business to comply with applicable federal state or international laws and regulations andor to comply with our privacy policies andor or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized collection transfer use or disclosure of personal or sensitive information or other user data may result in negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage may discourage potential users from purchasing tickets or trying our products and services and may result in proceedingsfines by governmental agencies andor private litigation brought by consumers the realization of one or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we have been granted trademark registrations and patents andor have trademark and patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign authorities for various proprietary trademarks technologies and other inventions any patent or trademark application filed may not result in a patent or trademark registration being issued or existing or future patents or trademarks may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors likewise the issuance of a patent or trademark registration to us does not mean that its processes inventions or trademark will not be found to infringe upon rights previously issued to third parties we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names or other intellectual property and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations therefore litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to governmental regulation and litigation 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

• political instability adverse changes in diplomatic relations and unfavorable economic and business conditions in the markets in which we currently have international operations or into which we may expand particularly in the case of emerging markets 

• more restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulation of the live entertainment and ticketing industries which could result in increased compliance costs andor otherwise restrict the manner in which we provide services and the amount of related fees charged for such services 

• limitations on the enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• limitations on the ability of foreign subsidiaries to repatriate profits or otherwise remit earnings 

• adverse tax consequences due both to the complexity of operating across multiple tax regimes as well as changes in or new interpretations of international tax treaties and structures 

• expropriations of property and risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities 

• diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries 

• limitations on technology infrastructure which could limit our ability to migrate international operations to a common ticketing system 

• variability in venue security standards and accepted practices 

• lower levels of internet usage credit card usage and consumer spending in comparison to those in the united states and 

• difficulties in managing operations and adapting to consumer desires due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with i business practices and customs that are common in certain foreign countries but might be prohibited by united states law and our internal policies and procedures and ii management and operational systems and infrastructures including internal financial control and reporting systems and functions staffing and managing of foreign operations which we might not be able to do effectively or costefficiently 

as we expand into new markets these risks will be intensified and will have the potential to impact a greater percentage of our business and operating results our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance and training programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary as well as those associated with newlyacquired businesses will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition given our substantial operations in the uk and the eu we face risks and uncertainties due to the uk’s exit from the european union the uk has agreed “third country” trading status in a new euuk trade and cooperation agreement applicable from january 1 2021 the trade agreement sets out arrangements in areas such as tarifffree trade in goods however it does not match the level of economic integration that existed while the uk was an eu member state there will be additional bureaucracy and cost with customs formalities vat excise duties and ata carnets for goods moved between the uk and the eu 

these risks and uncertainties include some regulatory uncertainty for data protection it has been confirmed that the uk ico will not be able to act as the single authority for eu multinationals this means that eu multinationals will often have two regulators one for uk activities and one for the rest of the eu27 where crossborder processing takes place live nation is currently reassessing its lead authority based on its crossborder processing so it continues to have a main point of contact for the eu in addition the uk is now not part of the eu for purposes of data transfers the gdpr principle that data cannot leave the eu to the uk in this case now applies while a four to six month grace period is currently in effect following this there are two possible scenarios 1 the uk is granted adequacy by the eu allowing data to continue to flow to the uk or 2 adequacy is not granted in which case additional safeguards such as contractual commitments would need to be implemented for euuk transfers live nation has already documented data flows to identified where uk flows occur and have contractual templates prepared should scenario two materialize 

live nation as a tour sponsor will continue to use tier 5 routes into the uk now including eu and eea musicians and crew on the sponsor’s license for tours in europe uk musicians’ working arrangements will be subject to individual eu member states and bilateral agreements reached with the uk government in many member states the working arrangements will be the same or similar such as in france and germany in others there may be new requirements for the sponsor as a significant sponsor with a longestablished footprint across the eu and eea markets live nation remains in a strong position when european markets reopen from coronavirus restrictions 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

• privacy laws and protection of personal or sensitive information as more particularly described above under the risk factor related to our processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information 

• compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries as more particularly described above under the risk factor related to our international operations 

• primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

• construction renovation and operation of our venues 

• licensing permitting and zoning including noise ordinances 

• human health safety and sanitation requirements 

• the service of food and alcoholic beverages 

• working conditions labor minimum wage and hour citizenship and employment laws 

• compliance with the ada and the dda 

• hazardous and nonhazardous waste and other environmental protection laws 

• sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes 

• marketing activities via the telephone and online and 

• historic landmark rules 

our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in proceedingsfines against us by governmental agencies and private actions brought by consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods additionally governmental actions such as the current sanctions by the united states department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities as well as other sanctions elsewhere in the world could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations other than as a result of laws that apply equally to all secondary ticket sellers and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage from time to time other states canadian provinces and the federal government have commenced investigations or inquiries related to other aspects of our ticketing business including a nowsettled suit brought by the canadian competition bureau relating to alleged deceptive marketing practices in addition we recently agreed with the united states department of justice to extend the duration of the consent decree we entered into in connection with our merger with ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restraints on our business see the risk factor entitled “we recently agreed with the united states department of justice to extend and clarify the courtimposed final judgment to which we became subject in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business” below we have incurred legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular segment thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in january 2020 we agreed with the united states department of justice to extend and clarify the courtimposed final judgment to which we became subject in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business 

in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc in 2010 we became subject through july 2020 to a courtimposed final judgment the “final judgment” that places certain restrictions and obligations on us in order to address the issues the united states department of justice the “doj” raised in its antitrust review of the merger pursuant to the final judgment we agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the final judgment the final judgment was due to expire in july 2020 in december 2019 we reached an agreement with the doj to clarify certain aspects of the final judgment and extend its duration through the end of 2025 the “amended final judgment” 

under the amended final judgment we may not i threaten to condition or actually condition the provision of live nation concerts on a venue choosing ticketmaster or ii retaliate ie withhold any live nation concerts in response to a venue choosing a ticketing services provider other than ticketmaster in addition pursuant to the amended final judgment i an independent monitor has been appointed to monitor and report to the doj on our compliance with the amended final judgment and investigate any potential violations thereof ii we appointed an internal antitrust compliance officer and have conducted and will continue to annually conduct internal trainings to ensure our employees fully comply with the amended final judgment iii we provided and will continue to provide notice to current or potential venue customers of the amended final judgment and its restrictions on our business conduct and iv we are subject to an automatic penalty of 1000000 for each violation we agreed to pay costs and fees for the independent monitor and the doj’s past investigation and enforcement 

during the duration of the amended final judgment we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order in addition our business will be under continued and enhanced scrutiny by the doj including by the independent monitor our compliance with the amended final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

in connection with the merger we also entered into a consent agreement with the canadian commissioner of competition the “canadian consent agreement” which had the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the final judgment on our business in canada the various terms of the canadian consent agreement expired on or before july 2020 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

• incur additional debt 

• pay dividends and make distributions 

• make certain investments 

• repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness 

• create liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• modify the nature of our business 

• enter into saleleaseback transactions 

• transfer and sell material assets and 

• merge or consolidate 

in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2020 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 1298 million was 50 billion our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 9617 million with outstanding letters of credit of 683 million we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fund payments on our debt thereby reducing funds available for operations and other purposes 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2020 534 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest and unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs is due in 2021 6125 million is due in the aggregate in 2022 and 2023 10 billion is due in the aggregate in 2024 and 2025 and 33 billion is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2020 we had 24 billion in operating lease liabilities of which 1924 million is due in 2021 and 1960 million is due in 2022 all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2021 see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

general risks relating to our business and operations 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks or disease epidemics 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters or similar events may deter artists from touring andor substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations periodic elevated terrorism alerts and fears from publicized contagious disease outbreaks have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

in the event of actual or threatened terrorism events some artists may refuse to travel or book tours which could adversely affect our business attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks which could adversely impact our operating results there have been terrorist attacks at events that we have promoted or with which we have otherwise been involved which have resulted in lawsuits questioning among other things the adequacy of the security precautions at these events while we are constantly evaluating the security precautions for our events in an effort to ensure the safety of the public no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances that we won’t face liabilities which could be substantial and materially impact our operating results in connection with such terrorist attacks at our events in addition we hold a large number of events at thirdparty venues that we do not own or operate while we do not have direct control over the security at such venues there can be no guarantees that victims of a terrorism or casualty event at such venues will not seek to impose or ultimately be successful in imposing liability on us 

while we have health and safety programs designed to mitigate the risks that are inherent in the staging of concerts and other events as well as those associated with extraordinary occurrences or actions that may take place at our events there can be no assurances that these programs will be sufficient to fully cover every possibility despite our best efforts some occurrences or actions are difficult to foresee and adequately plan for which could lead to fan vendor andor employee harm resulting in fines penalties legal costs and reputational risk that could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 our international operations accounted for approximately 36 of our revenue we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate operating income of 26 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and foreign exchange operating losses of 98 million and 18 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively which impacted our operating income loss see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

• using a significant portion of our available cash 

• issuing equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership 

• incurring substantial debt 

• incurring or assuming contingent liabilities known or unknown 

• incurring amortization expenses related to intangibles and 

• incurring large accounting writeoffs or impairments 

in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 

• integrating the operations financial reporting technologies and personnel of acquired companies including establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls appropriate for a public company environment 

• managing geographically dispersed operations 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience 

• the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies and 

• the impact of laws and regulations relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels which could significantly affect our ability to complete acquisitions and expand our business 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through october in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability in addition the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy which in turn could harm our results of operations due to the unprecedented stoppage of our concert events globally in midmarch due to the global covid19 pandemic we did not experience our typical seasonality trends in 2020 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters in thousands 



costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms conditions and costs that are appropriate for our business however heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty business interruption contingency and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions pandemics and other incidents any such events that are of a massive scale causing significant losses to insurance providers could negatively impact the insurance marketplace and as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining sufficiently high policy limits of coverage at a cost we believe to be reasonable including coverage for acts of terrorism cyber attacks weatherrelated damage and disruptions and other perils associated with our operations including communicable diseases andor pandemics we have experienced a significant increase in our cost to obtain appropriate insurance over the past several years though it is difficult to gauge the portion of this increase that is due to conditions in the insurance marketplace generally versus that attributable to our claims history for the mass casualty cybersecurity the global covid19 pandemic and other incidents we have faced we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2020 we had property and equipment with a net book value of 11 billion we cannot guarantee that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we cannot provide assurance that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty artists business interruption losses cyber attacks and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned or greater than expected multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

as of december 31 2020 we own operate or lease 155 entertainment venues throughout north america and 76 entertainment venues internationally we have a lease ending june 30 2030 for our corporate headquarters in beverly hills california used primarily by our executive group and certain of our domestic operations management staff we also lease office space and other facilities in 41 countries that support our concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising segment operations we believe our venues and facilities are generally wellmaintained and in good operating condition and have adequate capacity to meet our current business needs 

our leases are for varying terms ranging from monthly to multiyear these leases can typically be for terms of three to 10 years for our office leases and five to 25 years for our venue leases and many include renewal options there is no significant concentration of venues under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord we believe that an important part of our management activity is to negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions

executive overview 

due to the global covid19 pandemic we ceased all live nation tours and closed all our venues beginning in midmarch 2020 to support global efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus to ensure the safety of our artists fans and employees we held very few traditional events in the year and had minimal ticket sales 

as a result our overall revenue for 2020 decreased by 84 from 115 billion in 2019 to 19 billion in 2020 the revenue reduction was largely in our concerts and ticketing segments as a result of almost no shows occurring from midmarch through the end of the year and ticket sales for future shows sharply reduced given the uncertainty around when live events will return our ticketing revenue was also impacted by refunds for cancelled and postponed events the pandemic led to an operating loss for 2020 of 17 billion compared to operating income of 325 million for 2019 the impact of foreign exchange rates to both our revenue and operating income were minimal while the unparalleled disruption of the pandemic has had a material impact on our business as the leading global live event and ticketing company we still firmly believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues once business resumes twenty years of global growth demonstrates the resilience of fan demand for the live entertainment experience recent fan surveys indicate that the demand will be there when the shows return with 95 of fans expecting to attend concerts again once government andor health officials determine events can resume we are actively taking steps to ensure that when the time is right for us to do so we will be ready to quickly ramp back up and once again connect audiences to artists at the concerts they cherish 

our concerts segment revenue for 2020 was 15 billion compared to 94 billion for 2019 a reduction of 84 the unfavorable results were almost entirely due to the impact of the global covid19 pandemic of the 8117 events we held this year about 7100 of those were in the first quarter of 2020 prior to our shutdown overall our show count went from 40237 in 2019 down to 8117 in 2020 a reduction of 80 in addition to normal show activity from january through midmarch we were able to hold drivein concert events as well as socially distanced shows in some markets during the pandemic towards the end of the year we saw a return to almost normal levels of activity in new zealand which held our rhythm and vines festival in december with record levels of attendance coinciding with the trend on show count our total fan count for the year went from 977 million in 2019 down to 111 million in 2020 a reduction of 89 concerts had an operating loss for the year largely due to lost business resulting from the global covid19 pandemic and from sunk costs such as advertising expenses associated with shows cancelled or rescheduled to 2021 

our ticketing segment revenue for 2020 was 188 million compared to 15 billion for 2019 a reduction of 88 driven by a lack of ticket sales for future events and refunds on 2020 shows that were cancelled or rescheduled before refunds our feebearing tickets sold for the year were 585 million which compares to 2198 million for 2019 a reduction of 73 a total of 274 million tickets were refunded in the year equating to just slightly over 26 billion of gross transaction value the decline in operating results for the year was largely driven by the lack of ticket sales as well as refunds processed for cancelled and rescheduled events 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue for 2020 was 204 million compared to 590 million for 2019 a reduction of 65 after a very strong performance for the first 10 weeks of the year there was a significant reduction to sponsorship  advertising revenue and operating results due to the lack of shows and online activity resulting from the global covid19 pandemic 

we continue to be focused on mitigating the financial impact of the shutdown we have undertaken costsavings initiatives across the organization including salary reductions hiring freezes furloughs termination of certain employees as well as eliminating costs for consultants travel and entertainment and repairs and maintenance for our facilities we are also protecting our liquidity by tightly managing cash outflows associated with all our major expenditures operating expenses capital expenditures acquisitions and advances in both our ticketing and concert businesses the length and severity of the impact to live events and our related sponsorship and ticketing businesses is still uncertain the magnitude and pace of the recovery will depend on each market and their containment efforts the nature of the events being held ongoing efforts to develop rapid testing technologies and rollout of approved vaccines and treatments for covid19 we remain optimistic about the longterm potential of our company and the unique power of live shows to unite people we believe our aggressive costsavings and cash management programs combined with a strong liquidity profile position live nation to manage through the global covid19 pandemic and its impact on live events and provides us the flexibility to scale up quickly when our shows resume 

segment overview 

concerts 

revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year if a current year event is rescheduled into a future year all advertising costs incurred to date are expensed in the period when the event is rescheduled 

concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees event production costs showrelated marketing and advertising expenses along with other costs 

to judge the health of our concerts segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events and fan attendance in our network of owned or operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance market ticket pricing advance ticket sales and the number of major artist clients under management in addition at our owned or operated venues and festivals we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

ticketing 

revenue related to ticketing service charges is recognized when the ticket is sold for our thirdparty clients for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing revenue is deferred and recognized when the event occurs gross transaction value “gtv” represents the total amount of the transaction related to a ticket sale and includes the face value of the ticket as well as the service charge we use gtv to evaluate changes in ticket fee revenue that are driven by the pricing of our service charges 

ticketing direct operating expenses include call center costs and credit card fees along with other costs 

to judge the health of our ticketing segment we primarily review the gtv and the number of tickets sold through our ticketing operations the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services in addition we review the number of visits to our websites cost of customer acquisition the purchase conversion rate the overall number of customers in our database the number and percentage of tickets sold via mobile and the number of app installs for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

sponsorship  advertising 

revenue related to sponsorship and advertising programs is recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor unless the revenue is associated with a specific event in which case it is recognized when the event occurs 

sponsorship  advertising direct operating expenses include fulfillment costs related to our sponsorship programs along with other costs 

to judge the health of our sponsorship  advertising segment we primarily review the revenue generated through sponsorship arrangements and online advertising and the percentage of expected revenue under contract for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

key operating metrics   



  

1 events generally represent a single performance by an artist fans generally represent the number of people who attend an event festivals are counted as one event in the quarter in which the festival begins but the number of fans is based on the days the fans were present at the festival and thus can be reported across multiple quarters events and fan attendance metrics are estimated each quarter 

2 the feebearing tickets estimated above include primary and secondary tickets that are sold using our ticketmaster systems or that we issue through affiliates this metric includes primary tickets sold during the year regardless of event timing except for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing which are reported when the events occur the nonfeebearing tickets estimated above include primary tickets sold using our ticketmaster systems through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices along with tickets sold on our “do it yourself” platform these ticketing metrics are net of any refunds requested and any cancellations that occurred during the period and up to the time of reporting of these consolidated financial statements feebearing tickets sold above are net of refunds of 274 million tickets for the year ended december 31 2020 

nongaap measures 

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of aoi to operating income loss 



adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before certain stockbased compensation expense loss gain on disposal of operating assets depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment amortization of nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances and acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration obligations and acquisitionrelated severance and compensation  we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

aoi margin 

aoi margin is a nongaap financial measure that we calculate by dividing aoi by revenue we use aoi margin to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi margin assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi margin is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi margin as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi margin should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss margin and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

constant currency 

constant currency is a nongaap financial measure we calculate currency impacts as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 

segment operating results 

concerts 

our concerts segment operating results were and discussions of significant variances are as follows 



 



revenue 

concerts revenue decreased 80 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the unprecedented stoppage of our concert events globally during 2020 due to the global covid19 pandemic beginning in midmarch 2020 we ceased all of our tours closed our venues and cancelled or postponed our festivals to support global efforts at social distancing and mitigating the virus and to comply with restrictions put in place by various governmental entities concerts had incremental revenue of 1340 million during 2020 from acquisitions primarily that of a merchandise business 

operating results 

the decrease in concerts operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by the reduction in revenue caused by the global covid19 pandemic discussed above partially offset by cost reduction measures implemented during 2020 which have included salary reductions hiring freezes furloughs and reduction or elimination of other discretionary spending along with participating in government support programs globally depreciation and amortization during 2020 includes 232 million in impairment charges associated with revenuegenerating contracts venue management and leaseholds and clientvendor relationships intangible assets due to the impacts from the global covid19 pandemic depreciation and amortization in 2019 includes 212 million in impairment charges primarily associated with revenuegenerating contract intangible assets concerts operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 include net operating losses of 592 million related to acquisitions and new venues 

ticketing 

our ticketing segment operating results were and discussions of significant variances are as follows 



 



revenue 

ticketing revenue decreased 14 billion during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the lack of tickets available for sale to the public driven by the unprecedented stoppage of concerts sports and other events globally during 2020 and refunds for cancelled or rescheduled events for thirdparty clients due to the global covid19 pandemic 

operating results 

the decrease in ticketing operating results for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by the reduction in revenue caused by the global covid19 pandemic discussed above without a proportionate reduction in direct operating expenses as credit card fees and other costs associated with processing refunds and responding to fan and ticketing client inquiries continued this decrease was partially offset by cost reduction measures implemented during 2020 including salary reductions hiring freezes furloughs and reduction or elimination of other discretionary spending along with participating in government support programs globally 

sponsorship  advertising 

our sponsorship  advertising segment operating results were and discussions of significant variances are as follows 

  



 



revenue 

sponsorship  advertising revenue decreased 3866 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in sponsorship revenue associated with our venues festivals and lack of online activity as ticket sales declined driven by the unprecedented stoppage of events beginning in midmarch of 2020 due to the global covid19 pandemic 

operating results 

the decreased operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by the reduction in revenue discussed above along with higher fulfillment costs on certain sponsorship programs this decrease was partially offset by cost reduction measures implemented during 2020 including salary reductions hiring freezes furloughs and reduction or elimination of other discretionary spending along with participating in government support programs globally 

consolidated results of operations 



 



corporate 

corporate expenses decreased 667 million or 40 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to cost reduction efforts implemented during 2020 including salary reductions with salaries for senior executives reduced by up to 60 additional cost reduction efforts include hiring freezes reduction in the use of contractors furloughs and reduction or elimination of other discretionary spending including among other things travel and entertainment and repairs and maintenance 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 693 million or 44 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year due to additional interest costs from the issuance of our 475 senior notes in october 2019 the issuance of our 20 convertible senior notes in february 2020 and the issuance of our 65 senior secured notes in may 2020 these additional costs were partially offset by interest cost reductions realized from the october 2019 redemption of our 5375 senior notes and amendment to our senior secured credit facility 

our debt balances excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs were 50 billion and 34 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2020 we had a net tax benefit of 289 million on losses before income taxes of 19 billion compared to a net tax expense of 669 million on income before income taxes of 1851 million for 2019 in 2020 the net income tax benefit consisted of 164 million related to united states federal income taxes 128 million related to foreign entities partially offset by 03 million tax expense related to state and local income taxes the net decrease in tax expense of 958 million is due primarily to lower pretax income or higher pretax losses in taxable jurisdictions 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was a loss of 1033 million during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to income of 483 million in the prior year primarily due to lower operating results from certain concert and festival promotion businesses driven by postponed and cancelled events during 2020 due to the global covid19 pandemic 

liquidity and capital resources 

in response to the impact that the global covid19 pandemic has had on our business and the uncertainty of the duration of current conditions globally we have taken certain actions to strengthen our liquidity position and preserve our capital resources 

in april 2020 we amended our senior secured credit facility to provide an incremental 130 million revolving credit facility we further amended our senior secured credit facility in july 2020 which among other things substitutes our net leverage covenant with a 500 million liquidity covenant as defined in the agreement until the earlier of a december 31 2021 and b at our election any fiscal quarter prior to december 31 2021 in february 2020 we issued 400 million principal amount of 20 convertible senior notes due 2025 and in may 2020 we issued 12 billion principal amount of 65 senior secured notes due 2027 in january 2021 we issued 500 million principal amount of 375 senior secured notes due 2028 as a result we believe that these amendments and additional debt issuances will allow us the flexibility to manage our business through the disruption we experienced in 2020 and expect to experience in 2021 

our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 25 billion for both december 31 2020 and 2019 included in the december 31 2020 and 2019 cash and cash equivalents balances are 6735 million and 8377 million respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges which we refer to as client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 8362 million in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2020 we generally do not repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 49 billion and 33 billion at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes was 44 at december 31 2020 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in noninterestbearing and interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets including those resulting from the global covid19 pandemic 

for our concerts segment we often receive cash related to ticket revenue in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs in the united states this cash is largely associated with events in our owned or operated venues notably amphitheaters festivals theaters and clubs internationally this cash is from a combination of both events in our owned or operated venues as well as events in thirdparty venues associated with our promoter’s share of tickets in allocation markets we do not otherwise generally hold cash for events being held in thirdparty venues in the united states most venues traditionally hold all the cash and internationally either the venue holds all the cash or holds the portion of the cash associated with their ticket allocation with the exception of some upfront costs and artist advances which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event artists are paid when the event occurs under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits net of any advance they have received when an event is cancelled any cash held in deferred revenue is reclassified to accrued expenses as those funds are typically refunded to the fan within 30 days of event cancellation in certain markets we are offering fans an incentive to receive a voucher for a future ticket purchase to one of our events in lieu of receiving a refund for a cancelled event where a fan has elected to receive the incentive voucher the cash from the original ticket purchase remains in deferred revenue when a show is rescheduled fans have the ability to request a refund if they do not want to attend the event on the new date although historically we have had low levels of refund requests for rescheduled events 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaid expenses this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions pay artist advances and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts segment which reports the majority of its revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event due to the unprecedented stoppage of our concert events globally beginning in midmarch due to the global covid19 pandemic we did not experience our typical seasonality trends in 2020 see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions including those resulting from the global covid19 pandemic we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreement consists of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets including those resulting from the global covid19 pandemic should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should the counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreement default on its obligation we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash at the time of acquisition all amounts related to the use of cash for acquisitions discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2020 we used 411 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of a festival promotion business and a venue management business both located in the united states as of the date of acquisition the acquired businesses had a total of 774 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2019 we used 2351 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of venue management and concert promotion businesses located in canada belgium and the united states as of the date of acquisition the acquired businesses had a total of 747 million of cash on th eir balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

purchases and sales of noncontrolling interests net 

in 2020 we used 1062 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of the remaining or additional interest in festival promotion businesses located in the united states and brazil 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address fan and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals for amounts incurred but not yet paid for but net of expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords and noncontrolling interest partners or replacements funded by insurance proceeds consisted of the following 



maintenance capital expenditures for 2020 decreased from the prior year primarily due to a reduction in leasehold improvements of certain office facilities venuerelated projects and technology enhancements as part of our cash savings initiatives implemented in connection with the global covid19 pandemic 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2020 decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower spending in our amphitheater venues and a reduction in technologyrelated projects as part of our cash savings initiatives implemented in connection with the global covid19 pandemic 

for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 179 million 220 million and 116 million respectively of insurance proceeds and landlord or noncontrolling interest partner reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 150 million for the year ending december 31 2021 

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt and operating lease liabilities we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantees and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs scheduled maturities of operating lease liabilities minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent and deferred consideration liabilities as of december 31 2020 are as follows 



 



guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately  121 million and  165 million respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards obligations of a nonconsolidated affiliate and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower cashrelated income during 2020 resulting from the cessation of our concert events and the related rescheduling of shows to 2021 beginning in midmarch in response to the global covid19 pandemic 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities decreased 4669 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to fewer acquisitions less cash paid for capital expenditures and an increase in collections of notes receivable see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities increased 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher net proceeds in 2020 from debt issuances see “—sources of cash” above for further discussion 

seasonality 

information regarding the seasonality of our business can be found in part ii—financial information—item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—the company and summary of significant accounting policies 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary’s functional currency as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not have significant operations in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported an operating loss of 3552 million for the year ended december 31 2020 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2020 by 355 million as of december 31 2020 our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities in addition the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2020 we had forward currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of 420 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 50 billion of total debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs outstanding as of december 31 2020 of the total amount we had 45 billion of fixedrate debt and 05 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2020 each 25basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 12 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2020 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

in january 2020 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis the swap agreement expires in october 2026 has a notional amount of 5000 million and ensures that a portion of our floatingrate debt does not exceed 3397

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for at fair value unless the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value in which case the investment is accounted for at cost less any impairment intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projections of operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 

when performing quantitative assessments for impairment of our definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of those assets or asset group if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset or asset group is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts north america concerts artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the concerts segment sponsorship  advertising and international ticketing and north america ticketing within the ticketing segment 

we test goodwill for impairment in any period when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our reporting units the rapid and severe impacts of the global covid19 pandemic and more specifically the need to support global social distancing efforts mitigate the spread of the virus and comply with restrictions put in place by various governmental entities led to our decision to stop all tours and close our venues beginning in midmarch as such actions have a material impact on our cash flows during the suspension of operations we performed qualitative and sensitivity reviews in all three interim quarters of 2020 to assess whether we believed these actions caused the fair value of any of our reporting units to fall below its carrying value the result of these interim assessments was a conclusion that no conditions existed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying amount and therefore that we did not believe that our goodwill was impaired 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process the first step of the process is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment 

if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years to support our annual qualitative first step this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment and measure the impairment if any compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recorded as an impairment to goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative the reporting unit passes the impairment test in this case we will disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and disclose which reportable segment the reporting unit is included in 

in both steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants in addition we perform sensitivity analyses for all reporting units either during the first or the second step of the process to assist in the evaluation generally we test for sensitivities to discount rates revenue and terminal growth rates and market multiples which are the most significant assumptions 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a discounted cash flow or a market multiple methodology or a combination thereof the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples used on projected future cash flows and market participant acquisition premium a market participant acquisition premium represents the additional value a buyer would pay to obtain control of the respective reporting unit because having control would lead to higher cash flows lower cost of capital or both in 2020 both in the interim qualitative reviews and as part of the october 1 annual review market multiples were not incorporated into our assessments as our current financial metrics do not support use of the market approach as a corroborating approach when our business resumes and stabilizes we will reincorporate the market approach into our fair value methodology 

in 2020 as part of our annual impairment test four of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step three of these four of the reporting units did not advance to the second step these reporting units had no increases in discount rate and considerable excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests further review of these reporting units with sensitivity tests did not change our first step conclusions 

the north american concerts reporting unit advanced to the second step because it was unclear whether its fair value would exceed its carrying value primarily due to the loss of revenue resulting from the current cessation of concerts and an increase in its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit was approximately 35 therefore we concluded goodwill for this reporting unit was not impaired sensitivity tests showed that a 150basis point change in the discount rate or a 66 decline in the longterm revenue growth rate or a 13 decline in the margin was needed to change the conclusion 

the three remaining reporting units went straight to the second step as part of our policy to perform a quantitative test at least every five years to support future first step qualitative reviews the results of these quantitative tests continued to support a healthy amount of excess fair value over carrying value 

further we performed an october 1 2020 market capitalization reconciliation at a stock price of 5374 which yielded implied premiums of 40 and 60 for business enterprise value and equity respectively which suggests conservative internal forecasts versus the market 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

given the results of the tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion or production of an event is recognized when the show occurs revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorship agreements which is not related to a single event is classified as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of our share of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold in either the primary or secondary markets we act as an agent on behalf of our clients and therefore do not record the face value of the tickets as revenue for tickets sold for our concert and festival events where our concert promoters control ticketing revenue is recognized when the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges are shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events of our thirdparty clients and secondary market sales this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states state taxes and foreign withholding or transaction taxes on those foreign earnings that would be incurred if they were distributed it is not practicable to determine the amount of state and foreign income taxes if any that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement

our industry 

we operate in the following main industries within the live entertainment business live music events music venue operations the provision of management and other services to artists and athletes ticketing services and sponsorship and advertising sales 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then work with promoters who will contract with them or with artists directly to arrange events promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees artist managers primarily provide services to music artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise parking and premium seating 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting its fee venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets 

ticketing resale services generally refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally obtained the tickets from a venue or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket resale company is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand product or service these sponsorships typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as credit card beverage travel and telecommunications and may include event presales and onsite product activation 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts  our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists including intersegment revenue our concerts business generated 94 billion or 816 of our total revenue during 2019 we promoted more than 40000 live music and other events in 2019 including metallica ariana grande bon jovi pnk and backstreet boys and through festivals including rock in rio austin city limits lollapolooza electric daisy carnival rock werchter reading and bonnaroo while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we promote we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with limited associated direct operating expenses revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival promoter we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees and service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a fee or service charge for these services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers during 2019 we sold 48 48 3 and 1 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings including intersegment revenue our ticketing business generated 15 billion or 134 of our total revenue during 2019 which excludes the face value of tickets sold and is net of the fees paid to our ticketing clients through all of our ticketing services we sold 220 million tickets in 2019 on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 267 million tickets were sold using our ticketmaster systems including through season seat packages our venue clients’ box offices and other channels through which we did not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be sometimes with our guidance and recommendations agreements with venue clients in north america and australia generally grant us exclusive rights to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients in other international markets generally grant us the right to an allocation of tickets for events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider similarly in such international markets we have venue agreements which provide ticketmaster an allocation of tickets for all events at those venues while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute a portion of their tickets inhouse through their box office and season ticket programs in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients and generally subject to ticketmaster approval the client may allocate certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and not make those tickets available for sale by us due to these and other permitted thirdparty ticket distribution channels we do not always sell all of our clients’ tickets even at venues where we are the exclusive primary ticketing service provider and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and also varies as to any given client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing principally through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally we enter into arrangements with the holders of tickets previously distributed by a venue or other source to post those tickets for sale at a purchase price equal to a new sales price determined by the ticket holder plus a service fee to the buyer the seller in this circumstance receives the new sales price less a seller service fee 

sponsorship  advertising  our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert festival venue and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically presented exclusively to the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets including intersegment revenue our sponsorship  advertising business generated 5903 million or 51 of our total revenue during 2019 we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through october 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and festivals and to arrange multivenue or multifestival branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of client companies across various industry categories 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 

• stadiums —stadiums are multipurpose facilities often housing local sports teams stadiums typically have 30000 or more seats although they are the largest venues available for live music they are not specifically designed for live music 

• amphitheaters —amphitheaters are generally outdoor venues with between 5000 and 30000 seats that are used primarily in the summer season we believe they are popular because they are designed specifically for concert events with premium seat packages and better lines of sight and acoustics 

• arenas —arenas are indoor venues that are used as multipurpose facilities often housing local sports teams arenas typically have between 5000 and 20000 seats because they are indoors they are able to offer amenities that other similarsized outdoor venues cannot such as luxury suites and premium club memberships as a result we believe they are popular for higherpriced concerts aimed at audiences willing to pay for these amenities 

• theaters —theaters are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may include theatrical performances these venues typically have a capacity of between 1000 and 6500 theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriatelysized venue for developing artists and more artists in general because these venues have a smaller capacity than an amphitheater or arena they do not offer as much economic upside on a per show basis theaters can also be used yearround 

• clubs —clubs are indoor venues that are built primarily for music events but may also include comedy clubs these venues typically have a capacity of less than 1000 and often without full fixed seating because of their small size they do not offer as much economic upside but they also represent less risk to a concert promoter because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and also may provide a more appropriatelysized venue for developing artists clubs can also be used yearround 

• restaurants  music halls —restaurants  music halls are indoor venues that offer customers an integrated live music entertainment and dining experience this category includes our house of blues ® venues whose live music halls are specially designed to provide optimum acoustics and typically can accommodate between 1000 to 2000 guests a fullservice restaurant and bar is located adjacent to the live music hall we believe that the strength of the brand and the quality of the food service and unique atmosphere in our restaurants attract customers to these venues independently from a live music event and generate a significant amount of repeat business from local customers 

• festival sites —festival sites are outdoor locations used primarily in the summer season to stage large singleday or multiday concert events featuring several artists on multiple stages depending on the location festival site capacities can range from 10000 to over 100000 fans per day we believe they are popular because of the value provided to the fan by packaging several artists together for an event while festival sites only host a few events each year they can provide higher operating income because we are able to generate income from many different services provided at the event 

• other venues —other venues includes restaurants and exhibition halls that typically are not used for live music events 

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2019 



 

 operated festival sites includes multiyear agreements providing us the right to use public or private land for a defined period of time leading up to and continuing after the festival we may enter into multiple agreements for a single festival site or use the same site for multiple festivals we have aggregated the agreements for each festival site and reported them as one festival site 

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

• the quality of service delivered to our artists fans ticketing clients and corporate sponsors 

• our track record and reputation in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally 

• our artist relationships 

• our global footprint 

• the quality of our ticketing software and services 

• our ecommerce site and its extensive database 

• our diverse distribution platform venues 

• the scope effectiveness and expertise of our advertising and sponsorship programs and 

• our financial stability 

although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or greater financial marketing technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music promotion industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg frontier touring another planet entertainment jam productions ltd and imp in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in north america europe asia and australia aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west goldenvoice and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include asm global the madison square garden company the nederlander organization and bowery presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america europe and australianew zealand some of our competitors in venue management may have more attractive or a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through telephone and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase it has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services have created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale notwithstanding federal and state prohibitions the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events 

we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc cts eventim ag eventbrite etix ticketfly and seatgeek secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub vivid seats ticketnetwork viagogo and seatgeek and many others including large technology and ecommerce companies that we understand have recently entered or could enter these markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues strong brand association and attractive local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 

• privacy and the protection of personal or sensitive information 

• compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries 

• primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

• construction renovation and operation of our venues 

• licensing permitting and zoning including noise ordinances 

• human health safety and sanitation requirements 

• the service of food and alcoholic beverages 

• working conditions labor minimum wage and hour citizenship and employment laws 

• compliance with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 “ada” the united kingdom’s disability discrimination act of 1995 “dda” and similar regulations in other countries 

• hazardous and nonhazardous waste and other environmental protection laws 

• sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes 

• marketing activities via the telephone and online and 

• historic landmark rules 

we believe that we are materially in compliance with these laws 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world including the european union’s gdpr as defined and discussed below in item 1a—risk factors and the recentlyenacted california consumer protection act 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

from time to time federal state local and international authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws particularly as related to primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

the regulations relating to our food service operations in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol some jurisdictions have also proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works we have registered many of our trademarks and patents in the united states and in numerous foreign countries we believe that our intellectual property has significant value and is important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our products and services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 10500 fulltime employees including 6700 in north america and 3800 international employees of which approximately 10300 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ seasonal and parttime employees primarily for our live music venues and festivals as of december 31 2019 we employed approximately 15400 seasonal and parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 28000 seasonal and parttime employees in 2019 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we have good relationships with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage and our common stock if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business and operations 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our concerts business would be adversely affected our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including music artists as some agreements between a manager and an artist are not for a fixed period of time and are instead terminable at will 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consists primarily of our portion of per ticket convenience charges and per order service fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music and ticketing industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us which could negatively impact our financial results our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve within the live music industry our artist management business also competes with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone both to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists across the live music industry it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season and subscription sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the federal trade commission “ftc” the attorneys general of several individual states and various international governing bodies and statutory these restrictions include an obligation to obtain approval from the state of new jersey as to any material changes to our current linking practices from primary to secondary ticketing sites a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to a resale website owned or controlled by us is posted that the link is directing the user to a resale website and that ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements while there are certain state laws that now ban such speculative ticket listings we do not believe our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are subject to the same restrictions or required to make the same disclosures required of us though we believe the ftc has reached out to various other secondary ticketing marketplaces to ensure they state that the website is a resale website and prices could exceed face value as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our merger with ticketmaster entertainment inc we became subject to both a courtimposed final judgment in the united states and a consent agreement with canadian authorities pursuant to which we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements in addition we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that would be lawful for us to undertake absent the final judgment and the consent agreement our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order and we therefore face certain unquantifiable business risks as a result of compliance see the risk factor entitled “we recently agreed with the united states department of justice to extend and clarify the courtimposed final judgment to which we became subject in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business” below 

other variables related to the competitive environment that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

• an increased level of competition for advertising dollars which may lead to lower sponsorships as we attempt to retain advertisers or which may cause us to lose advertisers to our competitors offering better programs that we are unable or unwilling to match 

• unfavorable fluctuations in operating costs including increased guarantees to artists which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via higher ticket prices 

• inability or unwillingness to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses due to insufficient cash on hand or capacity under our senior secured credit facility which could result in the loss of key tours to competitors or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 

• competitors’ offerings that may include more favorable terms than we do in order to obtain agreements for new venues or ticketing arrangements or to obtain events for the venues they operate 

• technological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees and 

• other entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer 

the success of our ticketing business and other operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as well as affiliate and thirdparty computer systems wifi and other communication systems system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructure may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructure both of our own ticketing systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and thirdparty software wifi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war or human error in addition the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions the large infrastructure plant that is required to operate our systems requires an ongoing investment of time money and effort to maintain or refresh hardware and software and to ensure it remains at a level capable of servicing the demand and volume of business that ticketmaster receives failure to do so may result in system instability degradation in performance or unfixable security vulnerabilities that could adversely impact both the business and the consumers utilizing our services 

while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights 

due to the nature of our business we process store use transfer and disclose certain personal or sensitive information about our customers and employees penetration of our network or other misappropriation or misuse of personal or sensitive information and data including credit card information and other personally identifiable information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation inquiries and actions from governmental authorities and financial or other liabilities in addition security breaches incidents or the inability to protect information could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches and incidents could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and could result in significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer and employee information and to prevent security breaches or incidents which could result in data loss or other harm or loss such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities new variants of malware the development of new penetration methods and tools inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of customer or employee information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer and employee information the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may change frequently and as a result may be difficult for our business to detect for long periods of time in addition despite our best efforts we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches incidents and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will continue to do so in the future 

we also face risks associated with security breaches and incidents affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business in particular hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture andor may pose a security risk that could unexpectedly compromise information security for example in the second quarter of 2018 we became aware that a thirdparty customer support product used in certain jurisdictions outside the us was infected with a malicious code that may have allowed an unauthorized party to skim customers’ personal or payment information from their browsers while we acted promptly to disable the infected thirdparty product we continue to review our systems and interface with regulatory authorities as a result of this incident consumers are generally concerned with the security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal state and international laws we have expended significant capital and other resources to keep abreast of the evolving privacy landscape including the establishment of a dedicated global privacy organization within our legal team however our business could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or policies including for example practices or policies regarding the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement legislation or regulations in a manner which negatively affects our business financial condition andor results of operations due to the changes in the data privacy regulatory environment we may incur additional costs and challenges to our business that restrict or limit our ability to collect transfer use disclose secure or retain personal or sensitive information these changes in data privacy laws may require us to modify our current or future products services programs practices or policies which may in turn impact the products and services available to our customers 

regulators and government enforcement actions worldwide are imposing significant fines against companies for data privacy violations our business operations including our ticketing business involve the collection transfer use disclosure security and disposal of personal or sensitive information in various locations around the world including the european union “eu” where the general data protection regulation “gdpr” governs data privacy the gdpr imposes a minimum set of rules in relation to the processing of eu residents’ personal information which each eu member state was required to transpose into national law in the united kingdom which was a member of the eu at the time the gdpr was enacted for example the gdpr was given direct effect via the data protection act of 2018 the gdpr therefore does not result in a harmonized system of data privacy laws in the eu national law variations may apply failure to comply with the gdpr may result in significant monetary penalties of up to a 4 of a company’s worldwide total revenue or b €20 million whichever is higher we have committed significant capital and personnel resources to ensure so far as is possible that we are in compliance with the gdpr however there can be no assurances that violations will not occur particularly given the complexity of the gdpr and related local laws our business and the uncertainties that accompany new comprehensive legislation 

as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions the costs associated with compliance with applicable local data privacy laws and regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes andor make changes to our products services and operations which will increase operational cost and risk 

our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business to comply with applicable federal state or international laws and regulations andor to comply with our privacy policies andor or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized collection transfer use or disclosure of personal or sensitive information or other user data may result in negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage may discourage potential users from purchasing tickets or trying our products and services and may result in proceedingsfines by governmental agencies andor private litigation brought by consumers the realization of one or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks or disease epidemics 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters or similar events may deter artists from touring andor substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations periodic elevated terrorism alerts and fears from publicized contagious disease outbreaks have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

in the event of actual or threatened terrorism events some artists may refuse to travel or book tours which could adversely affect our business attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks which could adversely impact our operating results there have been terrorist attacks at events that we have promoted or with which we have otherwise been involved which have resulted in lawsuits questioning among other things the adequacy of the security precautions at these events while we are constantly evaluating the security precautions for our events in an effort to ensure the safety of the public no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances that we won’t face liabilities which could be substantial and materially impact our operating results in connection with such terrorist attacks at our events in addition we hold a large number of events at thirdparty venues that we do not own or operate while we do not have direct control over the security at such venues there can be no guarantees that victims of a terrorism or casualty event at such venues will not seek to impose or ultimately be successful in imposing liability on us 

the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business as well as our operating results for instance there are concerns regarding the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in china and its spread to other regions not only could such outbreak dissuade fans from attending events with large audiences it could also impede economic activity in impacted regions or globally leading to a decline in consumer discretionary spending on things such as concerts and other entertainment sporting and leisure events while the ultimate scope and scale of the coronavirus is unknown at this time our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively and materially impacted if conditions worsen or significant quarantines are put into place 

while we have health and safety programs designed to mitigate the risks that are inherent in the staging of concerts and other events as well as those associated with extraordinary occurrences or actions that may take place at our events there can be no assurances that these programs will be sufficient to fully cover every possibility despite our best efforts some occurrences or actions are difficult to foresee and adequately plan for which could lead to fan vendor andor employee harm resulting in fines penalties legal costs and reputational risk that could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

• political instability adverse changes in diplomatic relations and unfavorable economic and business conditions in the markets in which we currently have international operations or into which we may expand particularly in the case of emerging markets 

• more restrictive or otherwise unfavorable government regulation of the live entertainment and ticketing industries which could result in increased compliance costs andor otherwise restrict the manner in which we provide services and the amount of related fees charged for such services 

• limitations on the enforcement of intellectual property rights 

• limitations on the ability of foreign subsidiaries to repatriate profits or otherwise remit earnings 

• adverse tax consequences due both to the complexity of operating across multiple tax regimes as well as changes in or new interpretations of international tax treaties and structures 

• expropriations of property and risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities 

• diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries 

• limitations on technology infrastructure which could limit our ability to migrate international operations to a common ticketing system 

• variability in venue security standards and accepted practices 

• lower levels of internet usage credit card usage and consumer spending in comparison to those in the united states and 

• difficulties in managing operations and adapting to consumer desires due to distance language and cultural differences including issues associated with i business practices and customs that are common in certain foreign countries but might be prohibited by united states law and our internal policies and procedures and ii management and operational systems and infrastructures including internal financial control and reporting systems and functions staffing and managing of foreign operations which we might not be able to do effectively or costefficiently 

as we expand into new markets these risks will be intensified and will have the potential to impact a greater percentage of our business and operating results our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance and training programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary as well as those associated with newlyacquired businesses will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition given our substantial operations in the united kingdom the “uk” and the eu we face risks and uncertainties due to the referendum and approval by voters in the uk of an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk legally left the eu on january 31 2020 however the uk will be in a transition period until december 31 2020 during which the uk will continue to follow the eu’s rules and regulations the uk will remain in the single market and the customs union and the free movement of people will continue any new rules on trade travel and business for the uk and the eu will take effect on january 1 2021 

these risks and uncertainties include those related to expected continuation of volatility in the exchange rate which is anticipated to decrease during the transition period and decrease further when a trade deal is signed see the risk factor captioned “exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations” below for more discussion of the impact of currency fluctuations on our business continued uncertainty in the economic environment of the uk until the terms of a trade deal are agreed the impact of the ultimate terms of any new trade deal with the eu and any new trading terms with other territories including the united states now that the uk is free to negotiate its own trading terms with such other territories the ultimate terms for crossborder movement of workers agreed upon between the uk and the eu continued political uncertainty in the uk which is now lessened by the conservative party’s majority and the legal departure of the uk from the eu and continued regulatory uncertainty such as the potential need to find an alternative eu data protectionprivacy regulator should the uk’s current data privacy regulator the ico cease to be recognized by the data protection board made up of the regulators of the remaining eu member states though the ico could continue to be the regulator within the uk 

given that the form and specific mechanics of any new rules on trade travel and business for the uk and the eu are still in the process of being determined the full parameters and implications of brexit are currently unknown however these and other factors if realized could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while members of the uk government have recently made public statements recognizing the importance of and expressing a commitment to touring  eg  in january 2020 the uk’s culture minister nigel adams mp said “touring is the lifeblood of the industry and we recognise the importance of the continued ease of movement of musicians equipment and merchandise once we have left the eu visa rules for artists performing in the eu will not change until the implementation period ends in december 2020 they are being considered and we welcome the views of all hon members and the industry on movement within europe it is essential that free movement is protected for artists post 2020” until such rules and regulations are established the full impact of brexit on our company will remain unknowable 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

• privacy laws and protection of personal or sensitive information as more particularly described above under the risk factor related to our processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information 

• compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act 2010 and similar regulations in other countries as more particularly described above under the risk factor related to our international operations 

• primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

• construction renovation and operation of our venues 

• licensing permitting and zoning including noise ordinances 

• human health safety and sanitation requirements 

• the service of food and alcoholic beverages 

• working conditions labor minimum wage and hour citizenship and employment laws 

• compliance with the ada and the dda 

• hazardous and nonhazardous waste and other environmental protection laws 

• sales and other taxes and withholding of taxes 

• marketing activities via the telephone and online and 

• historic landmark rules 

our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in proceedingsfines against us by governmental agencies and private actions brought by consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams additionally governmental actions such as the current sanctions by the united states department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities as well as other sanctions elsewhere in the world could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations other than as a result of laws that apply equally to all secondary ticket sellers and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage from time to time other states canadian provinces and the federal government have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and certain of our subsidiaries and other aspects of our ticketing business including a nowsettled suit brought by the canadian competition bureau relating to alleged deceptive marketing practices as well as other ongoing investigations or inquiries in addition we recently agreed with the united states department of justice to extend the duration of the consent decree we entered into in connection with our merger with ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restraints on our business see the risk factor entitled “we recently agreed with the united states department of justice to extend and clarify the courtimposed final judgment to which we became subject in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business” below we have incurred legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular segment thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment levels fuel prices interest rates changes in tax rates and tax laws that impact companies or individuals and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions and public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2019 our international operations accounted for approximately 34 of our revenue we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate operating losses of 98 million and 18 million for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively and foreign exchange rate operating income of 72 million the year ended december 31 2017 which impacted our operating income see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

• using a significant portion of our available cash 

• issuing equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership 

• incurring substantial debt 

• incurring or assuming contingent liabilities known or unknown 

• incurring amortization expenses related to intangibles and 

• incurring large accounting writeoffs or impairments 

in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 

• integrating the operations financial reporting technologies and personnel of acquired companies including establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls appropriate for a public company environment 

• managing geographically dispersed operations 

• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience and 

• the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the eu and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed our failure or inability to complete future acquisitions as a result of such laws and regulations or the imposition of unfavorable terms as a condition to the completion of an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

• construction of live music venues may result in cost overruns delays or unanticipated expenses 

• desirable sites for live music venues may be unavailable or costly and 

• the attractiveness of our venue locations may deteriorate over time 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through october in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability in addition the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy which in turn could harm our results of operations 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 



there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have occurred and may in the future occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation in addition while we have security protocols in place at our events illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity adverse consequences including illness injury or death to the persons engaged in such activities or others and litigation against us while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we have been granted trademark registrations and patents andor have trademark and patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign authorities for various proprietary trademarks technologies and other inventions any patent or trademark application filed may not result in a patent or trademark registration being issued or existing or future patents or trademarks may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors likewise the issuance of a patent or trademark registration to us does not mean that its processes inventions or trademark will not be found to infringe upon rights previously issued to third parties we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names or other intellectual property and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations therefore litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms conditions and costs that are appropriate for our business however heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents any such events that are of a massive scale causing significant losses to insurance providers could negatively impact the insurance marketplace and as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining sufficiently high policy limits of coverage at a cost we believe to be reasonable including coverage for acts of terrorism cyber attacks weatherrelated damage and disruptions and other perils associated with our operations we have experienced a significant increase in our cost to obtain appropriate insurance over the past several years though it is difficult to gauge the portion of this increase that is due to conditions in the insurance marketplace generally versus that attributable to our claims history for the mass casualty cybersecurity and other incidents we have faced we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2019 we had property and equipment with a net book value of 11 billion we cannot guarantee that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we cannot provide assurance that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty artists business interruption losses cyber attacks and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned or greater than expected multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events increased weather variability due to climate change exacerbates weatherrelated issues we face due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

we recently agreed with the united states department of justice to extend and clarify the courtimposed final judgment to which we became subject in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc which places certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business 

in connection with the merger of live nation inc and ticketmaster entertainment llc in 2010 we became subject through july 2020 to a courtimposed final judgment or the final judgment that places certain restrictions and obligations on us in order to address the issues the united states department of justice the “doj” raised in its antitrust review of the merger pursuant to the final judgment we agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the final judgment the final judgment was due to expire in july 2020 in december 2019 we reached an agreement with the doj to clarify certain aspects of the final judgment and extend its duration for an additional five and a half years the “amended final judgment” 

under the amended final judgment we may not i threaten to condition or actually condition the provision of live nation concerts on a venue choosing ticketmaster and ii retaliate ie withhold any live nation concerts in response to a venue choosing a ticketing services provider other than ticketmaster in addition pursuant to the amended final judgment i an independent monitor has been appointed to investigate and report on our compliance with the final judgment ii we have appointed an internal antitrust compliance officer and will conduct regular internal training to ensure our employees fully comply with the final judgment iii we have provided notice to current or potential venue customers of our ticketing services of the amended final judgment and iv we are subject to an automatic penalty of 1000000 for each violation we have additionally agreed to pay costs and fees for the doj’s past investigation and enforcement 

during the duration of the amended final judgment we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order in addition our business will be under continued and enhanced scrutiny by the doj including by the independent monitor our compliance with the final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

in connection with the merger we also entered into a consent agreement with the canadian competition commission or the canadian consent agreement which has the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the final judgment on our business in canada the canadian consent agreement will remain in effect through july 2020 the canadian consent agreement creates similar risks for us both in terms of creating potential enforcement actions and in limiting us from pursuing certain business practices 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

• incur additional debt 

• pay dividends and make distributions 

• make certain investments 

• repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness 

• create liens 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• modify the nature of our business 

• enter into saleleaseback transactions 

• transfer and sell material assets and 

• merge or consolidate 

in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2019 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 942 million was 34 billion our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 4165 million with outstanding letters of credit of 835 million we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

• making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations 

• increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes 

• requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to fund payments on our debt thereby reducing funds available for operations and other purposes 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 

to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2019 378 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest and unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs is due in 2020 6050 million is due in the aggregate in 2021 and 2022 6039 million is due in the aggregate in 2023 and 2024 and 22 billion is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2019 we had 23 billion in operating lease liabilities of which 1948 million is due in 2020 and 1853 million is due in 2021 all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2020 see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

risks relating to our common stock 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock

executive overview 

live nation continued to see strong demand for live events in 2019 powering the concerts center of our business flywheel the execution of our key strategic initiatives is elevating the live experience through our concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising businesses to maximize benefits to the fans to the many artists teams and corporate sponsors we work with and to our stockholders 

as the leading global live event and ticketing company we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues and therefore drive growth across all our businesses we believe that by leveraging our leadership position in the entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience we will sell more tickets and uniquely engage more advertising partners by advancing innovation in ticketing technology we will continue to improve the fan experience by offering increased and more diversified secure choices in an expanded ticketing marketplace this gives us a compelling opportunity to grow our fan base and our results 

our total revenue for the year was 115 billion an increase of 08 billion or 7 on a reported basis or 09 billion or 9 on a constant currency basis as compared to last year the increase was largely driven by our concerts segment due to more events fans and onsite revenue we had record attendance at our concerts again in 2019 ticketing increased as well with strong growth in international ticket sales as well as the continued expansion of our resale business feebearing ticket sales also hit a record high in 2019 sponsorship  advertising again delivered strong growth over the prior year due in part to our first year with the rock in rio festival as well as adding marquee brands as partners around the globe our operating results improved this year compared to 2018 due to improved business performance 

our concerts segment drove most of our revenue growth this year generating 94 billion of revenue an increase of 07 billion or 8 on a reported basis or 08 billion a 9 increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates this higher revenue was due to additional arena activity in the united states more stadium shows in europe expanded theater and club activity worldwide and adding new markets to our festival footprint some of the biggest tours in 2019 featured metallica ariana grande backstreet boys jonas brothers and post malone overall concerts attendance grew by 49 million to nearly 98 million fans a record for the company and an increase of 5 over the prior year the growth of our amphitheater onsite business continued in 2019 with a focus on increased food and beverage offerings premium parking and other upsell programs these initiatives helped grow our ancillary revenue per fan at our amphitheaters by 250 in 2019 we have continued to focus on platinum and premium ticket opportunities for fans and improving the sellthrough on our best seats we will continue to look for expansion opportunities both domestically and internationally as well as ways to market our events more effectively in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and thereby sell more tickets and onsite products 

our ticketing segment revenue for 2019 increased by 156 million or 1 on a reported basis as compared to last year or 354 million a 2 increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates we sold 220 million feebearing tickets worldwide in 2019 a 24 million ticket increase over last year during 2019 we grew ticketingrelated revenue streams implemented tools to reduce costly fraudulent activity and reduced our cost of customer acquisition all these factors helped improve operating income for the segment as well as margins for the year our digital ticketing initiative continues to accelerate we have installed our presence system in over 700 venues in north america through the end of 2019 with approximately 121 million fans entering venues via the platform app installations increased by 18 during the year creating additional marketing opportunities for our company and driving conversion from search and discovery to purchase on the mobile front approximately 48 of our total tickets were sold via mobile and tablet devices in 2019 and our total mobile ticket sales increased by 13 yearoveryear this is a key component of our rollout of safetix which benefits our fans our artists and our clients we will continue to implement new features to drive further expansion of mobile ticket transactions and invest in initiatives aimed at improving the ticket search purchase and transfer process as a result we expect to continue to attract more ticket buyers and enhance the overall fan and venueartist client experience 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue for the year was up 863 million or 17 on a reported basis as compared to last year or 986 million or 20 without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates higher revenue largely resulted from new clients and increased festival sponsorship including the rock in rio event in brazil that occurs every two years in 2019 we increased our strategic sponsors globally and grew revenue from these partners by doubledigits the investment we have made over the past few years in premium inventory products including viewing decks vip clubs and social moments are generating sponsorship growth at our owned and operated venues renewals of our key existing clients were on plan and we saw growth from expanding into new categories such as consumer retail automotive and consumer packaged goods operating income improved by doubledigits as a result of the strong operational results 

we believe that our extensive onsite and online reach global venue distribution network artist relationships ticketing operations and live entertainment content are the keys to securing longterm sponsorship agreements with major brands and we plan to expand and enhance these assets while extending further into new markets internationally 

recent events

segment overview 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts 

our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists while our concerts segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year 

concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees event production costs showrelated marketing and advertising expenses along with other costs 

to judge the health of our concerts segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events and fan attendance in our network of owned or operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance market ticket pricing advance ticket sales and the number of major artist clients under management in addition at our owned or operated venues and festivals we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

ticketing 

our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a portion of the service charges as our fee gross transaction value “gtv” represents the total amount of the transaction related to a ticket sale and includes the face value of the ticket as well as the service charge service charges are generally based on a percentage of the face value or a fixed fee we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon scheduling by our clients we also offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing principally through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally our ticketing segment manages our online activities including enhancements to our ticketing websites and product offerings through our websites we sell tickets to our own events as well as tickets for our clients and provide event information revenue related to ticketing service charges is recognized when the ticket is sold for our thirdparty clients for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing revenue is deferred and recognized when the event occurs 

to judge the health of our ticketing segment we primarily review the gtv and the number of tickets sold through our ticketing operations the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services in addition we review the number of visits to our websites cost of customer acquisition the purchase conversion rate the overall number of customers in our database the number and percentage of tickets sold via mobile and the number of app installs for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

sponsorship  advertising 

our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert festival venue and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we drive increased advertising scale to further monetize our concerts platform through rich media offerings including advertising associated with live streaming and musicrelated content we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are associated with shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

to judge the health of our sponsorship  advertising segment we primarily review the revenue generated through sponsorship arrangements and online advertising and the percentage of expected revenue under contract for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

key operating metrics   



  

1 events generally represent a single performance by an artist fans generally represent the number of people who attend an event festivals are counted as one event in the quarter in which the festival begins but the number of fans is based on the days the fans were present at the festival and thus can be reported across multiple quarters events and fan attendance metrics are estimated each quarter 

2 the feebearing tickets estimated above include primary and secondary tickets that are sold using our ticketmaster systems or that we issue through affiliates this metric includes primary tickets sold during the year regardless of event timing except for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing which are reported when the events occur the nonfeebearing tickets estimated above include primary tickets sold using our ticketmaster systems through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices along with tickets sold on our “do it yourself” platform 

nongaap measures 

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of aoi to operating income loss 



adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before certain stockbased compensation expense loss gain on disposal of operating assets depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment amortization of nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances and acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration obligations and acquisitionrelated severance and compensation  we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

aoi margin 

aoi margin is a nongaap financial measure that we calculate by dividing aoi by revenue we use aoi margin to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi margin assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi margin is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi margin as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi margin should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss margin and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

constant currency 

constant currency is a nongaap financial measure we calculate currency impacts as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 

segment operating results 

concerts 

our concerts segment operating results were and discussions of significant variances are as follows 



 



revenue 

concerts revenue increased 6581 million during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year excluding the decrease of 1545 million related to currency impacts revenue increased 8126 million or 9 primarily due to more shows in our north america arenas international stadiums and theaters and clubs globally higher average ticket prices in our north america theaters higher festival activity and more shows sold to thirdparty promoters in markets where we do not have a local promoter presence these increases were partially offset by fewer shows in our north america stadiums international arenas and north america amphitheaters concerts had incremental revenue of 2690 million during 2019 primarily from the acquisitions of concert and festival promotion businesses 

operating results 

the decline in operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31 2019 were primarily driven by higher compensation costs associated with salary increases and headcount growth along with increased depreciation and amortization associated with recent enhancements to certain venues and 212 million of impairment charges recorded during 2019 partially offset by improved overall operating results from our events the impairment charges recorded in 2019 were primarily associated with revenuegenerating contract intangible assets as it was determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the respective intangible assets were less than their carrying value there were no significant impairments of intangible assets recorded during 2018 in 2018 we recorded a 105 million goodwill impairment related to our artist services nonmanagement business in connection with our annual impairment test there was no goodwill impairment recorded in 2019 included in selling general and administrative expenses for t he year ended december 31 2019 is 915 million of expenses related to new acquisitions and new venues in the concerts segment

revenue 

ticketing revenue increased 156 million during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year excluding the decrease of 198 million related to currency impacts revenue increased 354 million or 2 primarily due to increased international primary ticket fees driven by higher volume for concerts and sporting events along with higher north america resale volume and increased ancillary revenue these increases were partially offset by lower north america ticket volume driven by fewer concert events on sale in the first half of 2019 which was partially driven by more onsales for 2019 events in the fourth quarter of 2018 

operating results 

ticketing operating income increased for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to improved operating results from the increased ticketing activity discussed above along with lower customer acquisition costs and credit card related costs partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization associated with technology enhancements 

sponsorship  advertising 

our sponsorship  advertising segment operating results were and discussions of significant variances are as follows 

  



 



revenue 

sponsorship  advertising revenue increased 863 million during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year excluding the decrease of 123 million related to currency impacts revenue increased 986 million or 20 primarily due to growth in our national sponsorship programs in north america along with increased sponsorship for our festivals and other venues sponsorship  advertising had incremental revenue of 362 million during 2019 primarily from the acquisitions of concert and festival promotion businesses 

operating results 

the increased operating income for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by the higher sponsorship activity discussed above partially offset by higher fulfillment costs on certain sponsorship programs and increased compensation expense driven by headcount growth 

consolidated results of operations 



 



corporate 

corporate expenses increased 154 million or 10 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased compensation expense driven by headcount growth and incentive compensation as a result of the increased operating results 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 165 million or 12 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional interest costs from the 475 senior notes issued in october 2019 along with the 5625 senior notes and the 25 convertible senior notes issued in march 2018 

our debt balances excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs were 34 billion and 29 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively 

other expense income net 

other expense income net was expense of 122 million for the year ended december 31 2018 and includes net foreign exchange rate gains of 116 million the net foreign exchange rate gains and losses result primarily from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated net assets held internatio nally 

income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2019 we had a net tax expense of 669 million on income before income taxes of 1851 million compared to a net tax expense of 408 million on income before income taxes of 1311 million for 2018 in 2019 the net income tax expense consisted of a 53 million tax expense related to united states federal income taxes 555 million tax expense related to foreign entities and 61 million tax expense related to state and local income taxes the net increase in tax expense of 261 million is due primarily to higher pretax earnings in taxable jurisdictions 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 182 million during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily from earnings associated with the acquisition of a festival promotion business located in brazil that had been accounted for as an equity investment and improved operating results from certain artist management businesses located in the united states these increases were partially offset by the portion of the intangible impairment attributable to noncontrolling interests see “—concerts” segment above for further discussion 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 25 billion at december 31 2019 and 24 billion at december 31 2018 included in the december 31 2019 and 2018 cash and cash equivalents balance is 8377 million and 8591 million respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges which we refer to as client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to our clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 9337 million in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2019 we generally do not repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 33 billion and 28 billion at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes was 42 at december 31 2019 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaid expenses this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts segment which reports the majority of its revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly depending on economic conditions at the time we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments

debt covenants 

our senior secured credit facility contains a number of restrictions that among other things require us to satisfy a financial covenant and restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt make certain investments and acquisitions repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness create liens enter into agreements with affiliates modify the nature of our business enter into saleleaseback transactions transfer and sell material assets merge or consolidate and pay dividends and make distributions with the exception of subsidiary dividends or distributions to the parent company or other subsidiaries on at least a prorata basis with any noncontrolling interest partners noncompliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable the senior secured credit facility agreement has one covenant measured quarterly that relates to net leverage the consolidated net leverage covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the credit agreement of 575x over the trailing four consecutive quarters through september 30 2020 the consolidated total leverage ratio will reduce to 550x on december 31 2020 and 525x on december 31 2021 

the indentures governing our 475 senior notes 4875 senior notes and 5625 senior notes contain covenants that limit among other things our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments sell certain assets agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us merge consolidate or sell all of our assets create certain liens and engage in transactions with affiliates on terms that are not on an armslength basis certain covenants including those pertaining to incurrence of indebtedness restricted payments asset sales mergers and transactions with affiliates will be suspended during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both rating agencies and no default or event of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing all of these notes contain two incurrencebased financial covenants as defined requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 20x and a maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio of 35x

as of december 31 2019 we believe we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants related to our senior secured credit facility and our corporate senior notes and convertible senior notes we expect to remain in compliance with all of these debt covenants throughout 2020 

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash at the time of acquisition all amounts related to the use of cash for acquisitions discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2019 we used 2351 million of cash primarily for the acquisitions of venue management and concert promotion businesses located in canada belgium and the united states as of the date of acquisition the acquired businesses had a total of 747 million of cash on th eir balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2018 we used 1202 million of cash primarily for the payment of contingent consideration related to an acquisition in europe that occurred prior to the current accounting guidance for business combinations along with the acquisitions of various concert promotion and artist management businesses that are all located in the united states as of the date of acquisition the acquired businesses had a total of 193 million of c ash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

purchases and sales of noncontrolling interests net 

in 2018 we used 1596 million of cash primarily for the final payment due in connection with the 2017 acquisition of the remaining interest in a concert and festival promotion business located in the united states 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals for amounts incurred but not yet paid for but net of expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance proceeds consisted of the following 



maintenance capital expenditures for 2019 increased from the prior year primarily due to leasehold improvements of certain office facilities and venuerelated projects 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2019 increased from the prior year primarily due to enhancements at our north america amphitheaters and higher investment in technologyrelated projects 

for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 220 million 116 million and 205 million respectively of insurance proceeds and landlord reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 375 million for the year ending december 31 2020 

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt and operating lease liabilities we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantees and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs scheduled maturities of operating lease liabilities minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent and deferred consideration liabilities as of december 31 2019 are as follows 



 

1 does not include 400 million principal amount of 20 convertible senior notes due 2025 issued in february 2020 

2 on or after december 15 2022 holders may convert their 25 convertible senior notes 

3 does not include interest on the delayed draw term loan a or revolving credit facility as the balances were zero as of december 31 2019 

4 does not include 17 million of uncertain tax positions due to the unpredictable timing of the future payments 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 165 million and 156 million respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards obligations of a nonconsolidated affiliate and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased 4718 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year during 2019 our accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased as compared to increasing in 2018 based on the timing of payments and the increase in cash received for future events was lower in 2019 as compared to the same period of the prior year these decreases were partially offset by higher net cashrelated income in 2019 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities increased 1941 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher acquisition payments and higher purchases of property plant and equipment see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities increased 1401 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in purchases of noncontrolling interests and higher net proceeds from the refinancing of debt in october 2019 as compared to the refinancing in march 2018 

seasonality 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur from may through october in addition the timing of when tickets are sold and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a — risk factors — “our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years” 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary’s functional currency as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not have significant operations in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 1879 million for the year ended december 31 2019 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2019 by 188 million as of december 31 2019 our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities in addition the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2019 we had forward currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of 663 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 34 billion of total debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs outstanding as of december 31 2019 of the total amount we had 24 billion of fixedrate debt and 10 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2019 each 25basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 25 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2019 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

in january 2020 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis the swap agreement expires in october 2026 has a notional amount of 5000 million and ensures that a portion of our floatingrate debt does not exceed 3397 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements can be found in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—the company and summary of significant accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for at fair value unless the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value in which case the investment is accounted for at cost less any impairment intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projections of operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projections of operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 

when performing quantitative assessments for impairment of our definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of those assets or asset group if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset or asset group is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts north america concerts artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the concerts segment sponsorship  advertising and international ticketing and north america ticketing within the ticketing segment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our reporting units 

the first step of the process is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment 

if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years to support our annual qualitative first step this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment and measure the impairment if any compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recorded as an impairment to goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative the reporting unit passes the impairment test in this case we will disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and disclose which reportable segment the reporting unit is included in 

in both steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants in addition we perform sensitivity analyses for all reporting units either during the first or the second step of the process to assist in the evaluation generally we test for sensitivities to discount rates revenue and terminal growth rates and market multiples which are the most significant assumptions 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a discounted cash flow or a market multiple methodology or a combination thereof the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples used on projected future cash flows and market participant acquisition premium a market participant acquisition premium represents the additional value a buyer would pay to obtain control of the respective reporting unit because having control would lead to higher cash flows lower cost of capital or both 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

in 2019 all of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step five of the reporting units did not advance to the second step these reporting units had improved market multiples no increases in discount rate and considerable excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests further review of these reporting units with sensitivity tests did not change our first step conclusions 

the artist management reporting unit advanced to the second step because it was unclear whether its fair value would exceed its carrying value due to varied factors such as lower than expected financial results in the current year mixed changes in market multiples and a decrease in discount rate the excess of fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit was approximately 57 therefore we concluded goodwill for this reporting unit was not impaired sensitivity tests showed that a 500basis point change in the discount rate or a 225 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 400basis point change in the market multiple was needed to change the conclusion 

the artist services reporting unit advanced to the second step because it was unclear whether its fair value would exceed its carrying value due to varied factors such as lower than expected financial results in the current year mixed changes in market multiples and a decrease in discount rate the excess of fair value over carrying value was approximately 23 therefore we concluded goodwill for this reporting unit was not impaired sensitivity tests showed that a 250basis point change in the discount rate or a 100 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 250basis point change in the market multiple was needed to change the conclusion based upon the results of the 2018 and 2017 second test we recorded impairment charges of 105 million and 200 million respectively for the artist services nonmanagement reporting unit 

given the results of the tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion or production of an event is recognized when the show occurs revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorship agreements which is not related to a single event is classified as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of our share of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold in either the primary or secondary markets we act as an agent on behalf of our clients and therefore do not record the face value of the tickets as revenue for tickets sold for our concert and festival events where our concert promoters control ticketing revenue is recognized when the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges are shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events of our thirdparty clients and secondary market sales this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states state taxes and foreign withholding or transaction taxes on those foreign earnings that would be incurred if they were distributed it is not practicable to determine the amount of state and foreign income taxes if any that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement

our strengths 

we believe we have unique resources that are unmatched in the live entertainment industry 



our history 

we were incorporated in delaware on august 2 2005 in preparation for the contribution and transfer by clear channel communications inc of substantially all of its entertainment assets and liabilities to us we completed this separation on december 21 2005 and became a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” 

on january 25 2010 we merged with ticketmaster entertainment llc and it became a whollyowned subsidiary of live nation effective with the merger live nation inc changed its name to live nation entertainment inc 

our industry 

we operate in the following main industries within the live entertainment business live music events music venue operations the provision of management and other services to artists sponsorship and advertising sales and ticketing services 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or with artists directly to arrange events promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees artist managers primarily provide services to music recording artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise parking and premium seating 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand product or service these sponsorships typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as credit card beverage travel and telecommunications and may include event presales and onsite product activation 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting its fee venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets 

ticketing resale services generally refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally obtained the tickets from a venue or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket resale company is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts sponsorship  advertising and ticketing 

concerts    our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists including intersegment revenue our concerts business generated 88 billion  or 813  of our total revenue during 2018  we promoted almost   35000  live music and other events in 2018  including artists such as beyoncé and jayz pnk kevin hart justin timberlake imagine dragons and bruno mars and through festivals such as austin city limits lollapolooza electric daisy 

carnival rock werchter reading and download while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we promote we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with limited associated direct operating expenses revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival promoter we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees and service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

sponsorship  advertising    our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert festival venue artist relationship and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that support their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically presented exclusively to the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets including intersegment revenue our sponsorship  advertising business generated 504 million  or 47  of our total revenue during 2018  we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through october 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and festivals and to arrange multivenue or multifestival branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of client companies across various industry categories 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a fee or service charge for these services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers during the year ended december 31 2018  we sold 52  43  4  and 1  of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings including intersegment revenue our ticketing business generated 15 billion  or 142  of our total revenue during 2018  which excludes the face value of tickets sold and is net of the fees paid to our ticketing clients through all of our ticketing services we sold 217 million  tickets in 2018  on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 265 million  tickets were sold using our ticketmaster systems including through season seat packages our venue clients’ box offices and other channels through which we do not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

 we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be sometimes with our guidance and recommendations agreements with venue clients in north america and australia generally grant us exclusive rights to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients in other international markets generally grant us the right to an allocation of tickets for events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider similarly in such international markets we have venue agreements which provide ticketmaster an allocation of tickets for all events at those venues where we have exclusive venue contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute a portion of their tickets inhouse through their box office and season ticket programs in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients and generally subject to ticketmaster approval the client may allocate certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and not make those tickets available for sale by us due to these and other permitted thirdparty ticket distribution channels we do not always sell all of our clients’ tickets even at venues where we are the exclusive primary ticketing service provider and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and also varies as to any given client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing principally through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally we enter into arrangements with the holders of tickets previously distributed by a venue or other source to post those tickets for sale at a purchase price equal to a new sales price determined by the ticket holder plus a service fee to the buyer the seller in this circumstance receives the new sales price less a seller service fee 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 



fan by packaging several artists together for an event while festival sites only host a few events each year they can provide higher operating income because we are able to generate income from many different services provided at the event 

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2018  

 

 exclusive booking rights for festival sites includes multiyear agreements providing us the right to use public or private land for a defined period of time leading up to and continuing after the festival we may enter into multiple agreements for a single festival site or use the same site for multiple festivals we have aggregated the agreements for each festival site and reported them as one festival site 

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or greater financial marketing technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music promotion industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg frontier touring another planet entertainment jam productions ltd and imp in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in north america europe asia and australia aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west goldenvoice and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include asm global the madison square garden company the nederlander organization and bowery presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america europe and australianew zealand some of our competitors in venue management may have more attractive or a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues strong brand association and attractive local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through telephone and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services have created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale notwithstanding federal and state prohibitions the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events 

we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc cts eventim ag eventbrite etix ticketfly and seatgeek secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub vivid seats ticketnetwork and seatgeek and many others including large technology and ecommerce companies that we understand have recently entered or are likely to enter these markets 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 



 we believe that we are materially in compliance with these laws we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world including the european union’s gdpr as defined and discussed below in item 1a—risk factors 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

from time to time federal state local and international authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws particularly as related to primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

the regulations relating to our food service operations in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol some jurisdictions have also proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works we have registered many of our trademarks in the united states and in numerous foreign countries we believe that our intellectual property has significant value and is important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our products and services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 9500 fulltime employees  including 6200 in north america and 3300 international employees of which approximately 9300 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ seasonal and parttime employees primarily for our live music venues and festivals as of december 31 2018  we employed approximately 13000 seasonal and 

parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 29000 seasonal and parttime employees in 2018  

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we have good relationships with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage and our common stock if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business and operations 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our concerts business would be adversely affected our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore 

if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including music artists 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile as well as direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order service fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music and ticketing industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us which could negatively impact our financial results our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve within the live music industry our artist management business also competes with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone both to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists across the live music industry it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season and subscription sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a 

decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the federal trade commission “ftc” the attorneys general of several individual states and various international governing bodies and statutory these restrictions include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom  website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our resale ticketing options without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any material changes to our current linking practices a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to a resale website owned or controlled by us is posted that the link is directing the user to a resale website and that ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our merger with ticketmaster entertainment inc we became subject to both a courtimposed final judgment in the united states and a consent agreement with canadian authorities pursuant to which we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements in addition we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that would be lawful for us to undertake absent the final judgment and the consent agreement our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order and we therefore face certain unquantifiable business risks as a result of compliance 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 the success of our ticketing business and other operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as well as affiliate and thirdparty computer systems wifi and other communication systems system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructure may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructure both of our own ticketing systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and thirdparty software wifi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war or human error in addition the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions the large infrastructure plant that is required to operate our systems requires an ongoing investment of time money and effort to maintain or refresh hardware and software and to ensure it remains at a level capable of servicing the demand and volume of business that ticketmaster receives failure to do so may result in 

system instability degradation in performance or unfixable security vulnerabilities that could adversely impact both the business and the consumers utilizing our services 

while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights 

due to the nature of our business we process store use transfer and disclose certain personal or sensitive information about our customers and employees penetration of our network or other misappropriation or misuse of personal or sensitive information and data including credit card information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation inquiries and actions from governmental authorities and financial or other liabilities in addition security breaches incidents or the inability to protect information could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches and incidents could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and could result in significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring 

although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer and employee information and to prevent security breaches or incidents which could result in data loss or other harm or loss such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities new variants of malware the development of new penetration methods and tools inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of customer or employee information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer and employee information the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may change frequently and as a result may be difficult for our business to detect for long periods of time in addition despite our best efforts we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches incidents and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will continue to do so in the future 

we also face risks associated with security breaches and incidents affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business in particular hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture andor may pose a security risk that could unexpectedly compromise information security for example in the second quarter of 2018 we became aware that a thirdparty customer support product used in certain jurisdictions outside the us was infected with a malicious code that may have allowed an unauthorized party to skim customers’ personal or payment information from their browsers while we acted promptly to disable the infected thirdparty product we continue to review our systems and interface with regulatory authorities as a result of this incident consumers are generally concerned with the security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal state and international laws we have expended significant capital and other resources to keep abreast of the evolving privacy landscape including the establishment of a dedicated global privacy organization within our legal team however our business could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or policies including for example practices or policies regarding the collection transfer use disclosure security and retention of personal or sensitive information or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement legislation or regulations in a manner which negatively affects our business financial condition andor results of operations due to the changes in the data privacy regulatory environment we may incur additional costs and challenges to our business that restrict or limit our ability to collect transfer use disclose secure or retain personal or sensitive information these changes in data privacy laws may require us to modify our current or future products services programs practices or policies which may in turn impact the products and services available to our customers 

regulators and government enforcement actions worldwide are imposing significant fines against companies for data privacy violations our business operations including our ticketing business involve the collection transfer use disclosure security and disposal of personal or sensitive information in various locations around the world including the european union “eu” where the general data protection regulation “gdpr” that governs data privacy became effective on may 25 2018 the gdpr imposed a minimum set of rules in relation to the processing of eu residents’ personal information which 

each eu member state is required to transpose into national law in the united kingdom for example the gdpr was given direct effect via the data protection act of 2018 the gdpr therefore did not result in a harmonized system of data privacy laws in the eu national law variations may apply failure to comply with the gdpr may result in significant monetary penalties of up to a 4 of a company’s worldwide total revenue or b €20 million whichever is the highest we committed significant capital and personnel resources to ensure so far as is possible that we are in compliance with the gdpr however there can be no assurances that violations will not occur particularly given the complexity of the gdpr and related local laws our business and the uncertainties that accompany new comprehensive legislation 

as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions the costs associated with compliance with applicable local data privacy laws and regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes andor make changes to our products services and operations which will increase operational cost and risk 

our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we are affiliated or otherwise conduct business to comply with applicable federal state or international laws and regulations andor to comply with our privacy policies andor or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized collection transfer use or disclosure of personal or sensitive information or other user data may result in negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage may discourage potential users from purchasing tickets or trying our products and services and may result in proceedingsfines by governmental agencies andor private litigation brought by consumers the realization of one or all of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters or similar events may deter artists from touring andor substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

in the event of actual or threatened terrorism events some artists may refuse to travel or book tours which could adversely affect our business attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks which could adversely impact our operating results there have been terrorist attacks at events that we have promoted or with which we have otherwise been involved which have resulted in lawsuits questioning among other things the adequacy of the security precautions at these events while we are constantly evaluating the security precautions for our events in an effort to ensure the safety of the public no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances that we won’t face liabilities which could be substantial and materially impact our operating results in connection with such terrorist attacks at our events in addition we hold a large number of events at thirdparty venues that we do not own or operate while we do not have direct control over the security at such venues there can be no guarantees that victims of a terrorism or casualty event at such venues will not seek to impose or ultimately be successful in imposing liability on us the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business as well as our operating results 

while we have health and safety programs designed to mitigate the risks that are inherent in the staging of concerts and other events as well as those associated with extraordinary occurrences or actions that may take place at our events there can be no assurances that these programs will be sufficient to fully cover every possibility despite our best efforts some occurrences or actions are difficult to foresee and adequately plan for which could lead to fan vendor andor employee harm resulting in fines penalties legal costs and reputational risk that could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 



 as we expand into new markets these risks will be intensified and will have the potential to impact a greater percentage of our business and operating results our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance and training programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary as well as those associated with newlyacquired businesses will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition given our substantial operations in the united kingdom the “uk” and the eu we face risks and uncertainties due to the referendum and approval by voters in the uk of an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” these risks and uncertainties include potential deterioration in the macroeconomic environment that could lead to less demand for concerts and other live entertainment in the uk and the eu potential legal and regulatory changes that could among other things impact the ease of movement between the uk and the eu for artists and touring personnel and exchange rate risks such as the ten percent drop in the uk pound sterling against the us dollar that occurred the day after the brexit referendum which resulted in higher artist fees in pound sterling terms see the risk factor captioned “exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations” below for more discussion of the impact of currency fluctuations on our business the form and specific mechanics of brexit are still in the process of being determined and thus the full parameters and implications of brexit are currently unknown however these and other factors if realized could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in proceedingsfines against us by governmental agencies and private actions brought by consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams additionally governmental actions such as the current sanctions by the united states department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities as well as other sanctions elsewhere in the world could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and certain of our subsidiaries and other aspects of our ticketing business including a suit brought by the canadian competition bureau relating to alleged deceptive marketing practices we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular segment thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment levels fuel prices interest rates changes in tax rates and tax laws that impact companies or individuals and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions and public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2018  our international operations accounted for approximately 34  of our revenue we cannot predict the future relationship between the united 

states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced a foreign exchange rate operating loss of 18 million for the year ended december 31 2018  and foreign exchange rate operating income of 72 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively which impacted our operating income see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

 in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 

 we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the eu and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed our failure or inability to complete future acquisitions as a result of such laws and regulations or the imposition of unfavorable terms as a condition to the completion of an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of 

any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through october in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability in addition the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy which in turn could harm our results of operations 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 



there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have occurred and may in the future occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation in addition while we have security protocols in place at our events illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity adverse consequences including illness injury or death to the persons engaged in such activities or others and litigation against us while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names or other intellectual property and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations therefore litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms conditions and costs that are appropriate for our business however heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated 

conditions and incidents any such events that are of a massive scale causing significant losses to insurance providers could negatively impact the insurance marketplace and as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining sufficiently high policy limits of coverage at a cost we believe to be reasonable including coverage for acts of terrorism cyber attacks weatherrelated damage and disruptions and other perils associated with our operations we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2018  we had property and equipment with a net book value of 9466 million  we cannot guarantee that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we cannot provide assurance that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned or greater than expected multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 



 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2018  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 949 million  was 29 billion  our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 2763 million  with outstanding letters of credit of 887 million  we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2018  821 million  of our total indebtedness excluding interest and unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs is due in 2019  1945 million  is due in the aggregate in 2020  and 2021  17 billion  is due in the aggregate in 2022  and 2023  and 8927 million  is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2018  we had 25 billion  in operating lease commitments of which 1952 million  is due in 2019  and 1890 million  is due in 2020  all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2019  see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact 

our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

risks relating to our common stock 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the 

public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock

from inception and through december 31 2018  we have not declared or paid any dividends we presently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business and to make debt repayments as they become due therefore we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future moreover the terms of our senior secured credit facility limit the amount of funds that we will have available to declare and distribute as dividends on our common stock payment of future cash dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable laws after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs plans for expansion and contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends 

recent sales of unregistered securities 

on december 10 2018 we issued 28 shares of common stock to a holder of our 25 convertible senior notes due 2019 in respect of such holder’s election to convert 1000 principal amount of notes in accordance with the conversion rights set forth in the indenture governing the notes the shares of common stock issued in the transaction were valued using a conversion rate of 288363 shares issuable per 1000 principal amount of notes converted with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares as set forth in the indenture representing an implied conversion price of 3468 per share we relied upon the exemption from registration under the securities act of 1933 as amended provided by section 4a2 thereof for transactions not involving a public offering

segment overview 

our reportable segments are concerts sponsorship  advertising and ticketing 

concerts 

our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists while our concerts segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year 

concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees event production costs showrelated marketing and advertising expenses along with other costs 

to judge the health of our concerts segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events and fan attendance in our network of owned or operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance market ticket pricing advance ticket sales and the number of major artist clients under management in addition at our owned or operated venues and festivals we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates

ticketing

key operating metrics   



  

 

nongaap measures 

reconciliation of adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before certain stockbased compensation expense loss gain on disposal of operating assets depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment amortization of nonrecoupable ticketing contract advances and acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration obligations and acquisitionrelated severance and compensation   we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of aoi to operating income loss 

aoi margin 

aoi margin is a nongaap financial measure that we calculate by dividing aoi by revenue we use aoi margin to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi margin assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income loss thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi margin is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi margin as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi margin should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss margin and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

constant currency 

constant currency is a nongaap financial measure we calculate currency impacts as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 24 billion  at december 31 2018  and 18 billion  at december 31 2017  included in the december 31 2018  and 2017  cash and cash equivalents balance is 8591 million  and 7694 million  respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges which we refer to as client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 9928 million  in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2018  we generally do not repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 28 billion  and 23 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes was 42  at december 31 2018  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaid expenses this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts segment which reports the majority of its revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly depending on economic conditions at the time we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals for amounts incurred but not yet paid for but net of expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance proceeds consisted of the following 



maintenance capital expenditures for 2018  increased from the prior year primarily due to venuerelated projects and leasehold improvements of certain office facilities 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2017  increased from the prior year primarily associated with leasehold improvements of certain office facilities and technology system enhancements 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2017  increased from the prior year primarily due to wifi enhancements at our amphitheaters festival site improvements and higher investment in technology

aggregate minimum rentals of 316 million  to be paid to us in years 2019 through 2032 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 156 million  and 183 million  respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards obligations of a nonconsolidated affiliate and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended 2018  compared to year ended 2017   

cash provided by operating activities increased 3181 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the prior year during 2018 we had higher net cashrelated income and received more cash for future events increasing deferred revenue additionally our prepaid expenses increased due to higher eventrelated costs partially offset by the timing of payments of our accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

year ended 2017  compared to year ended 2016   

cash provided by operating activities increased 248 million for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the prior year during 2017 our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased based on timing of payments partially offset by an increase in prepaid eventrelated expenses and lower increase in deferred revenue as compared to the prior year 

investing activities 

year ended 2018  compared to year ended 2017   

cash used in investing activities increased 1693 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher acquisition payments including purchases of intangible assets and increased net notes receivable advances see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

year ended 2017  compared to year ended 2016   

cash used in investing activities decreased 989 million for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the prior year due to lower net payments for acquisitions partially offset by higher purchases of property plant and equipment see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

year ended 2018  compared to year ended 2017 

cash provided by financing activities increased 3159 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  as compared to cash used in financing activities in the prior year primarily due to net proceeds from the refinancing of debt in march 2018 partially offset by taxes paid for net share settlements of equity awards and an increase in purchases of noncontrolling interests 

year ended 2017  compared to year ended 2016 

cash used in financing activities increased 2263 million for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to cash provided by financing activities in the prior year primarily due to net proceeds of 2673 million received in 2016 from the issuance of the 4875 senior notes and increased term loan a and term loan b borrowings after repayment of the 7 senior notes and related costs partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2017 

seasonality 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur from may through october in addition the timing of when tickets are sold and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a — risk factors — “our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years” 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary’s functional currency as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not have significant operations in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 986 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2018  by 99 million  as of december 31 2018  our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities in addition the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2018  we had forward currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of 894 million  

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 29 billion  of total debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs outstanding as of december 31 2018  of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 18 billion of fixedrate debt and 11 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2018  each 25basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 29 million  when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2018  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements can be found in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 1 —the company and summary of significant accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not 

control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the cost method of accounting intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projections of operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projections of operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount 

when performing quantitative assessments for impairment of our definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of those assets or asset group if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset or asset group is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts north america concerts artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the concerts segment sponsorship  advertising and international ticketing and north america ticketing within the ticketing segment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our reporting units 

the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment 

if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment and measure the impairment if any compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative the reporting unit passes the impairment test inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates in this case we will disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and disclose which reportable segment the reporting unit is included in 

in both steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants we perform sensitivity analyses when the most likely result is unclear in the first and second steps in our process generally we test for sensitivities to discount rates revenue growth and market multiples which are the most significant assumptions 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination thereof the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples used on projected future cash flows and control premium a control premium represents the additional value an investor would pay in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective reporting unit 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit less those cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

in 2018  all of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step five of the reporting units did not advance to the second step these reporting units had improved market multiples and considerable excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests while also having mixed results on discount rates and financial results when compared to recent financial expectations further review of these reporting units with sensitivity tests did not change our first step conclusions 

the artist management reporting unit advanced to the second step and its excess of fair value over carrying value was approximately 20  the reporting unit had increased discount rates but had higher than previously projected financial results in the current year market multiples remained consistent with the prior year sensitivity tests on the artist management reporting unit showed that a 220basis point change in the discount rate or a 56 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 240basis point change in the market multiple was needed to change the conclusion 

finally the artist services reporting unit also advanced to the second step however due to a decrease in future financial performance expectations and increased discount rates the reporting unit did not pass the quantitative test this reporting unit accounts for approximately 2 of our goodwill at december 31 2018 based upon the results of the 2018 and 2017 tests we recorded impairment charges of 105 million and 200 million respectively for the artist services nonmanagement reporting unit there were no impairment charges in 2016 

given the results of the tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe any of our reporting units other than the artist services reporting unit are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion or production of an event is recognized when the show occurs revenue related to larger global tours is also recognized when the show occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorship agreements which is not related to a single event is classified as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of our share of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold in either the primary or secondary markets we act as an agent on behalf of our clients and therefore do not record the face value of the tickets as revenue for tickets sold for our concert and festival events where our concert promoters control ticketing revenue is recognized when the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges are shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events of our thirdparty clients and secondary market sales this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states state taxes and foreign withholding or transaction taxes on those foreign earnings that would be incurred if they were distributed it is not practicable to determine the amount of state and foreign income taxes if any that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

the tcja significantly changed existing united states tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business we have completed the accounting for all the impacts of the tcja see—item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 8 —income taxes for further information about these changes these computations are based on the regulations and guidance already provided by federal and state tax authorities we will continue to assess the impact of any further guidance from federal and state tax authorities on our business and consolidated financial statements any future adjustments will be recognized as discrete income tax expense or benefit in the period the guidance is issued

our strengths 

we believe we have unique resources that are unmatched in the live entertainment industry 



our history 

we were incorporated in delaware on august 2 2005 in preparation for the contribution and transfer by clear channel communications inc of substantially all of its entertainment assets and liabilities to us we completed this separation on 

december 21 2005 and became a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” 

on january 25 2010 we merged with ticketmaster entertainment llc and it became a whollyowned subsidiary of live nation effective with the merger live nation inc changed its name to live nation entertainment inc 

our industry 

we operate in these main industries within the live entertainment business live music events associated venue operations and the provision of management and other services to artists sponsorship and advertising sales and ticketing services 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or with artists directly to arrange events promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees artist managers primarily provide services to music recording artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise venue sponsorships parking and premium seating 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand product or service these sponsorships typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as credit card beverage hotel and telecommunications and may include event presales and onsite product activation 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting its fee venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets 

ticketing resale services generally refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally obtained the tickets from a venue or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket resale company is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts sponsorship  advertising and ticketing 

concerts    our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists during 2017  our concerts business generated 79 billion  or 763  of our total revenue we promoted more than   29500  live music events in 2017  including artists such as u2 coldplay guns n’ roses metallica bruno mars and depeche mode and through festivals such as austin city limits lollapolooza electric daisy carnival bottlerock rock werchter and reading while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant associated direct operating expenses revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival promoter we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees festival sponsorships and service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

sponsorship  advertising    our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concerts venue festivals and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically presented exclusively to the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets during 2017  our sponsorship  advertising business generated 445 million  or 43  of our total revenue we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through october 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and festivals and to arrange multivenue or multifestival branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of client companies across various industry categories 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a fee or service charge for these services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers during the year ended december 31 2017  we sold 60  33  5  and 2  of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings during 2017  our ticketing business generated 21 billion  or 207  of our total revenue which excludes the face value of tickets sold through all of our ticketing services we sold 206 million  tickets in 2017  on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 292 million  tickets in total were sold using our ticketmaster systems including through season seat packages our venue clients’ box offices and other channels through which we do not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

 we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be sometimes with our guidance and recommendations agreements with venue clients in north america and australia generally grant us the right to sell tickets for 

all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients internationally generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider where we have exclusive venue contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute a portion of their tickets inhouse through their box office and season ticket programs in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and does not make those tickets available for sale by us as a result of these and sometimes other channels through which tickets are sometimes distributed with our permission outside of our ticketing system even at venues where we are the primary ticketing service provider we do not always sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any given client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing principally through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally we enter into arrangements with the holders of tickets previously distributed by a venue or other source to post their ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a new sales price determined by the ticket holder plus a predetermined service fee to the buyer the seller in this circumstance receives the new sales price less a predetermined seller service fee 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 



the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2017  

 

 exclusive booking rights for festival sites includes multiyear agreements providing us the right to use public or private land for a defined period of time leading up to and continuing after the festival we may enter into multiple agreements for a single festival site or use the same site for multiple festivals we have aggregated the agreements for each festival site and reported them as one festival site 

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or financial marketing support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from both promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music promotion industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg dainty group another planet entertainment jam productions ltd imp and livestyle inc in addition to numerous smaller regional 

companies and various casinos and venues in north america europe asia and australia aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west goldenvoice and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg aeg the madison square garden company and the nederlander organization in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america europe and australianew zealand some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues strong brand association and attractive local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through telephone and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services have created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale notwithstanding federal and state prohibitions the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events 

we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc cts eventim ag eventbrite etix ticketfly and seatgeek secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub vivid seats ticketnetwork and seatgeek and many others including large technology companies that we understand have recently entered or are likely to enter these markets 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 



we believe that we are materially in compliance with these laws we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world including the european union’s gdpr as defined and discussed below in item 1a—risk factors 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

from time to time federal state local and international authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws particularly as related to primary ticketing and ticket resale services 

the regulations relating to our food service operations in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol more recently some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services we have registered many of our trademarks in numerous foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 8800 fulltime employees  including 5700 in north america and 3100 international employees of which approximately 8600 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ seasonal and parttime employees primarily for our live music venues and festivals as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 12500 seasonal and parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 28000 seasonal and parttime employees in 2017  

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have 

been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage and our common stock if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business and operations 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our concerts business would be adversely affected our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at 

booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including music artists 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile as well as direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order service fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music and ticketing industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us which could negatively impact our financial results our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve within the live music industry our artist management business also competes with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone both to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists across the live music industry it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season and subscription sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the federal trade commission “ftc” and the attorneys general of several individual states various international governing bodies and statutory these restrictions include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom  website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our resale ticketing options without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any material changes to our current linking practices a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to a resale website owned or controlled by us is posted that the link is directing the user to a resale website and that ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our merger with ticketmaster entertainment inc we became subject to both a courtimposed final judgment in the united states and a consent agreement with canadian authorities pursuant to which we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements in addition we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that would be lawful for us to undertake absent the final judgment and the consent agreement our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order and we therefore face certain unquantifiable business risks as a result of compliance 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 the success of our ticketing business and other operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure as well as affiliate and thirdparty computer systems wifi and other communication systems system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructure may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructure both of our own ticketing systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and thirdparty software wifi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war or human error in addition the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions the large infrastructure plant that is required to operate our systems requires an ongoing investment of time money and effort to maintain or refresh hardware and software and to ensure it remains at a level capable of servicing the demand and volume of business that ticketmaster receives failure to do so may result in system instability degradation in performance or unfixable security vulnerabilities that could adversely impact both the business and the consumer utilizing our services 

while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal or sensitive information could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights 

we process store use and disclose certain personal or sensitive information about our customers and employees penetration of our network or other misappropriation or misuse of personal or sensitive information and data including credit card information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation inquiries and actions from governmental authorities and financial and other liabilities in addition security breaches or the inability to protect our information could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and impose significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities new variants of malware the development of new penetration methods and tools inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer information we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will continue to do so in the future we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the sharing use disclosure and protection of personal or sensitive information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal state and international laws we have expended significant capital and other resources to keep abreast of the evolving privacy landscape including the establishment of a dedicated global privacy organization within our legal team however we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies including practices or policies regarding the collection transfer use disclosure security and disposal of personal or sensitive information or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations due to the changes in the data privacy regulatory environment we may incur additional costs and challenges to our business that restrict or limit our ability to collect transfer use disclose secure or dispose of personal or sensitive information these changes in data privacy laws may require us to modify our current or future products services or programs which may impact the products and services available to our customers 

regulators are imposing significant fines for data privacy violations our business operations including our ticketing business involve the collection transfer use disclosure security and disposal of personal or sensitive information in various locations around the world including the european union “eu” the eu adopted a new law governing data privacy called the general data protection regulation “gdpr” that will become effective in may 2018 the gdpr creates new requirements regarding personal information noncompliance with the gdpr carries significant monetary penalties of up to the higher of 4 of a company’s worldwide total revenue or €20 million we have committed significant capital and personnel resources to ensure that we are in compliance with the gdpr by its effective date however there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts or that violations will not occur particularly given the complexity of both the gdpr and our business as well as the uncertainties that accompany new comprehensive legislation 

as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions worldwide that have data privacy laws the costs associated with compliance with these regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes andor make changes to our products services and operations which will increase operational cost and risk 

our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personal or sensitive information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from purchasing tickets trying our products and services and result in proceedingsfines by governmental agencies and private actions brought by consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters or similar events may deter artists from touring andor substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

in the event of actual or threatened terrorism events some artists may refuse to travel or book tours which could adversely affect our business attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks which could adversely impact our operating results there have recently been terrorist attacks at events that we have promoted or with which we have otherwise been involved which have resulted in lawsuits questioning among other things the adequacy of the security precautions at these events while we are constantly evaluating the security precautions for our events in an effort to ensure the safety of the public no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances that we won’t face liabilities which could be substantial and materially impact our operating results in connection with such terrorist attacks at our events in addition we hold a large number of events at thirdparty venues that we do not own or operate while we do not have direct control over the security at such venues there can be no guarantees that victims of a terrorism or casualty event at such venues will not seek to impose or ultimately be successful in imposing liability on us the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business as well as our operating results 

while we have health and safety programs designed to mitigate the risks that are inherent in the staging of concerts and other events as well as those associated with extraordinary occurrences or actions that may take place at our events there can be no assurances that these programs will be sufficient to fully cover every possibility despite our best efforts some occurrences or actions are difficult to foresee and adequately plan for which could lead to fan vendor andor employee harm resulting in fines penalties legal costs and reputational risk that could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 



 as we expand into new markets these risks will be intensified and will have the potential to impact a greater percentage of our business and operating results our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance and training programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary as well as those associated with newlyacquired businesses will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition given our substantial operations in the united kingdom the “uk” and the eu we face risks and uncertainties due to the recent referendum and approval by voters in the uk of an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” these risks and uncertainties include potential deterioration in the macroeconomic environment that could lead to less demand for concerts and other live entertainment in the uk and the eu potential legal and regulatory changes that could among other things impact the ease of movement between the uk and the eu for artists and touring personnel and exchange rate risks such as the ten percent drop in the uk pound sterling against the us dollar that occurred the day after the brexit referendum which resulted in higher artist fees in pound sterling terms see the risk factor captioned “exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations” below for more discussion of the impact of currency fluctuations on our business while the full parameters and implications of brexit are currently unknown these and other factors if realized could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 



 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in proceedingsfines against us by governmental agencies and private actions brought by consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams additionally governmental actions such as the current sanctions by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities as well as other sanctions elsewhere in the world could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and certain of our subsidiaries and other aspects of our ticketing business including a recent suit brought by the canadian competition bureau relating to alleged deceptive marketing practices we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular segment thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment 

sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as unemployment levels fuel prices interest rates changes in tax rates and tax laws that impact companies or individuals and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions and public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2017  our international operations accounted for approximately 34  of our revenue we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate operating income of 72 million and 21 million for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  and foreign exchange rate operating losses of 245 million for the year ended december 31 2015  which impacted our operating income see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

 in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 



we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed our failure or inability to complete future acquisitions as a result of such laws and regulations or the imposition of unfavorable terms as a condition to the completion of an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through october in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact 

comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability in addition the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy which in turn could harm our results of operations 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 



there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have occurred and may in the future occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation in addition while we have security protocols in place at our events illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity adverse consequences including illness injury or death to the persons engaged in such activities or others and litigation against us while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we also have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names or other intellectual property and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations therefore litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms conditions and costs that are appropriate for our business however heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at a reasonable cost including coverage for acts of terrorism cyber attacks weatherrelated damage and other perils associated with our operations we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2017  we had property and equipment with a net book value of 8859 million  

damage andor disruption to operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with premiums and deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot guarantee that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot provide assurance that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned or greater than expected multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the 

event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2017  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 380 million  was 23 billion  our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 2812 million  with outstanding letters of credit of 838 million  we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2017  3537 million  of our total indebtedness excluding interest and unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs is due in 2018  1139 million  is due in the aggregate in 2019  and 2020  3746 million  is due in the aggregate in 2021  and 2022  and 15 billion  is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2017  we had 22 billion  in operating lease commitments of which 1759 million  is due in 2018  and 1708 million  is due in 2019  all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2018  see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

risks relating to our common stock 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock

 item 2   properties 

as of december 31 2017  we own operate or lease 115  entertainment venues and 140 other facilities including office leases throughout north america and 35  entertainment venues and 118 other facilities internationally we believe our venues and facilities are generally wellmaintained and in good operating condition and have adequate capacity to meet our current business needs we have a lease ending june 30 2020 for our corporate headquarters in beverly hills california used primarily by our executive group and certain of our domestic operations management staff 

our leases are for varying terms ranging from monthly to multiyear these leases can typically be for terms of three to five years for our office leases and 10 to 20 years for our venue leases and many include renewal options there is no significant concentration of venues under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord we believe that an important part of our management activity is to negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions

our common stock was listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “lyv” beginning on december 21 2005 there were 3608 stockholders of record as of february 20 2018  this figure does not include an estimate of the indeterminate number of beneficial holders whose shares may be held of record by brokerage firms and clearing agencies the following table presents the high and low sales prices of our common stock on the new york stock exchange during the calendar quarter indicated 



dividend policy 

from inception and through december 31 2017  we have not declared or paid any dividends we presently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business and to make debt repayments as they become due therefore we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future moreover the terms of our senior secured credit facility limit the amount of funds that we will have available to declare and distribute as dividends on our common stock payment of future cash dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable laws after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs plans for expansion and contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

live nation had a very strong year in 2017 marked by growing global fan demand for live experiences we continued to focus on elevating those experiences through our concerts sponsorship  advertising and ticketing businesses to maximize benefits to the fans to the many artists and teams with whom we work and to our stockholders we entered new markets 

during the year and introduced new ticketing products that we believe will reap rewards for years to come despite a competitive technological landscape that evolved more rapidly than ever we achieved record levels in our key financial and operational metrics our total revenue for the year was 103 billion  making this our twelfth consecutive year of revenue growth and giving us once again our highest revenue year ever our concerts sponsorship  advertising and ticketing segments all reported doubledigit revenue growth as a result of both record attendance at our concerts and record ticket sales in our ticketing business our focus on amplifying and growing our concert flywheel continues to deliver benefits the unique power of the live concert experience enables fans around the world to connect with artists and each other and provides us the platform to do the same our overall revenue in 2017 increased by 20 billion  on a reported and constant currency basis as compared to last year a 23  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates the increase was largely driven by growth in our concerts segment with an increase in the number of events fans and the revenue we are generating onsite at the events ticketing increased as well with strong growth in concert event sales both in north america and our international markets as well as the continued expansion of our resale business sponsorship  advertising again delivered strong growth over 2016 due to a number of new strategic multiyear deals and market expansion in europe our operating results declined this year due to a 1100 million legal accrual to resolve a dispute that had been ongoing for two years and we are pleased to have the matter resolved as the leading global live event and ticketing company we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues and therefore drive growth across all our businesses we believe that by leveraging our leadership position in the entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience we will sell more tickets and uniquely engage more advertising partners by advancing innovation in ticketing technology we will continue to improve the fan experience by offering increased and more diversified secure choices in an expanded ticketing marketplace this gives us a compelling opportunity to grow our fan base and our results 

our concerts segment was the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth with an increase of 16 billion  on a reported and constant currency basis as compared to last year a 25  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates this higher revenue was partially due to additional arena shows in the united states stadium events internationally and growth in our theater and club business worldwide some of the biggest tours in 2017 featured u2 coldplay guns n’ roses depeche mode and bruno mars overall concert attendance grew by nearly 15 million  to nearly 86 million  fans a record for the company and an increase of 21  over 2016 we continued to expand our global festival portfolio in 2017 adding brands like bottlerock to our leading roster and growing total festival attendance by 14 nearly 16 million fans attended our amphitheater shows throughout the year with florida georgia line future luke bryan and zac brown all playing to sold out audiences over the summer the growth of our amphitheater onsite business continued in 2017 particularly with our enhanced beer and wine programs expansion of our specialty spirits points of sale and introduction of unique branded food concepts these programs helped grow our ancillary revenue per fan by 9 in 2017 as pointed out in the third quarter of 2017 another one of our ongoing priorities is to grow our ticket revenue by optimizing ticket pricing we saw success in this area in the united states improving the price on our best available seats in the amphitheaters and expanding our premium ticket offerings in our international business our promotions business in germany continued its strong growth doubling its number of fans to over 16 million our concert teams abroad also made progress on our ticket pricing initiative broadening our platinum and vip pricing programs in both the united kingdom and mainland europe our concerts operating results for the year improved over 2016 largely due to the impact of these business improvements and strategic initiatives mentioned above we will continue to look for expansion opportunities both domestically and internationally as well as ways to market our events more effectively in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and to sell more tickets and onsite products 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue for the year was up 675 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 664 million  an 18  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates higher revenue resulted from new clients and increased international sponsorship resulting from the opening of the royal arena in copenhagen the expansion of our germany business and the acquisition of prominent festivals in sweden and australia in 2017 we continued to build new venue products across our portfolio in the united states as well as new festival products we also saw growth through category expansion these efforts resulted in growth in the number of strategic brand relationships and our revenue from those clients both of which increased by doubledigits over 2016 we continue to make progress on festival apps expanding ad units and geofencing products to drive our online business sponsorship  advertising operating income for the year improved by 10  on a reported basis which was driven by higher revenue partially offset by continued investment in our sales team’s personnel and expertise we believe that our extensive onsite and online reach global venue distribution network artist relationships ticketing operations and live entertainment content are the keys to securing longterm sponsorship agreements with major brands and we plan to expand these assets while extending further into new markets internationally 

our ticketing segment revenue for the year increased by 3159 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 3119 million  a 17  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates this increase was largely due to a 10  growth in feebearing ticket sales globally to over 205 million  tickets in 2017 largely driven by increased sales for concert events the rollout of our integrated ticketing platform continues to be a success story and that along with improvements to both our fanfocused website and our mobile sales platform drove conversion increases each quarter in 2017 as compared to 

the prior year we also notably launched our verified fan product in 2017 which ensures that more tickets get into the hands of bona fide fans and we are very encouraged by the progress so far selling nearly 3 million tickets during the year on the mobile front 33  of our total tickets were sold via mobile and tablet devices compared to 27  in 2016 our total mobile ticket sales increased by 35 yearoveryear as mentioned previously operating results for ticketing were down this year due to a 1100 million accrual to settle a legal dispute although operationally they delivered strong growth we will continue to implement new features to drive further expansion of mobile ticket transactions and invest in initiatives aimed at improving the ticket search purchase and transfer process as a result we expect to continue to attract more ticket buyers and enhance the overall fan and venueartist client experience 

segment overview 

our reportable segments are concerts sponsorship  advertising and ticketing prior to 2017 we reported an artist nation segment which is now included in our concerts segment see—part ii—financial information—item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12 —segment data for further discussion of the segment change 

concerts 

our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world the creation of associated content and the provision of management and other services to artists while our concerts segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year 

concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees event production costs showrelated marketing and advertising expenses along with other costs 

to judge the health of our concerts segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events and fan attendance in our network of owned or operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance market ticket pricing advance ticket sales and number of major artist clients under management in addition at our owned or operated venues and festivals we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

sponsorship  advertising 

our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concerts venue artist relationship and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we drive increased advertising scale to further monetize our concerts platform through rich media offerings including advertising associated with live streaming and musicrelated content we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are associated with shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

to judge the health of our sponsorship  advertising segment we primarily review the revenue generated through sponsorship arrangements and online advertising revenue and the percentage of expected revenue under contract for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 

ticketing 

our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a portion of the service charges as our fee gross transaction value “gtv” represents the total amount of the transaction related to a ticket sale and includes the face value of the ticket as well as the service charge service charges are generally based on a percentage of the face value or a fixed fee we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon scheduling by our clients we also offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing principally through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally our ticketing segment manages our online activities including enhancements to our ticketing websites and product offerings through our websites we sell tickets to our own events as well as tickets for our clients and provide event information revenue related to ticketing service charges is recognized when the ticket is sold for our outside clients for our own events where our concert promoters control ticketing revenue is deferred and recognized as the event occurs 

to judge the health of our ticketing segment we primarily review the gtv and the number of tickets sold through our primary and secondary ticketing operations the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services in addition we review the number of visits to our websites the purchase conversion rate the overall number of customers in our database the number and percentage of tickets sold via mobile and the number of app installs for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates

operating results 

the reduced operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31 2017  were primarily driven by a 200 million goodwill impairment related to our artist services nonmanagement business higher compensation costs associated with salary increases and headcount growth including recent acquisitions startup costs for new venues we are now operating and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration the goodwill impairment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with our annual impairment test discussed in “—critical accounting policies—goodwill” these impacts were partially offset by strong operating results for our events noted above increased ancillary revenue per fan at our amphitheaters and higher commissions in the management business

income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2017  we had a net tax benefit of 172 million  on loss before income taxes of 94 million  compared to a net tax expense of 280 million  on income before income taxes of 483 million  for 2016  in 2017  the net income tax benefit consisted of a 571 million  tax benefit related to united states federal income taxes offset by tax expense of 351 million  related to foreign entities and 48 million  related to state and local income taxes the net decrease in 

tax expense of 452 million  is due primarily to the reduction in certain federal deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” partially offset by additional tax expense due to an increase in and the geographical mix of pretax foreign earnings 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was enacted which amends the internal revenue code to reduce tax rates and modify policies credits and deductions for individuals and businesses for businesses the tcja reduces the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35 to a flat 21 rate the rate reduction took effect on january 1 2018 we have concluded that the tcja will cause our united states deferred tax assets and liabilities to be revalued deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense the provisional amount recorded to revalue our united states net deferred tax liability balance was a 557 million  income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2017

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 18 billion  at december 31 2017  and 15 billion  at december 31 2016  included in the december 31 2017  and 2016  cash and cash equivalents balance is 7694 million  and 5910 million  respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges which we refer to as client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 8737 million  in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2017  we do not intend to repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 23 billion  at each of december 31 2017  and 2016  our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes was 39  at december 31 2017  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaid expenses this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts segment which reports the majority of its revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and 

outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly depending on economic conditions at the time we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default

in october 2016 we issued 575 million  principal amount of 4875  senior notes due 2024 and amended our senior secured credit facility the amendment to the senior secured credit facility provided the existing term loan a and term loan b lenders with an option to convert their outstanding principal amounts into the new term loans excluding the outstanding principal amounts for lenders who elected to convert their outstanding term loans total proceeds of 8585 million  were used to repay 1233 million  outstanding principal amount of our borrowings under the senior secured credit facility to repay the entire 425 million  principal amount of our 7  senior notes due 2020 and to pay the related redemption premium of 149 million  on the 7 senior notes and accrued interest and fees of 384 million  leaving 2569 million  in additional cash available for general corporate purposes we recorded 140 million  as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to this refinancing in 2016 there were no significant gains or losses on extinguishment of debt in 2017 or 2015 

debt covenants 

our senior secured credit facility contains a number of restrictions that among other things require us to satisfy a financial covenant and restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt make certain investments and acquisitions repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness create liens enter into agreements with affiliates modify the nature of our business enter into saleleaseback transactions transfer and sell material assets merge or consolidate and pay dividends and make distributions with the exception of subsidiary dividends or distributions to the parent company or other subsidiaries on at least a prorata basis with any noncontrolling interest partners noncompliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable the senior secured credit facility agreement has one covenant measured quarterly that relates to total leverage the consolidated total leverage covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the credit agreement of 525 x over the trailing four  consecutive quarters through september 30 2018 the consolidated total leverage ratio will reduce to 50 x on december 31 2018 475 x on december 31 2019 and 45 x on december 31 2020 

the indentures governing our 4875 senior notes and 5375 senior notes contain covenants that limit among other things our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments sell certain assets agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us merge consolidate or sell all of our assets create certain liens and engage in transactions with affiliates on terms that are not on an armslength basis certain covenants including those pertaining to incurrence of indebtedness restricted payments asset sales mergers and transactions with affiliates will be suspended during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both rating agencies and no default or event of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing the 4875 senior notes and the 5375 senior notes contain two  incurrencebased financial covenants as defined requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 x and a maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio of 35 x 

some of our other subsidiary indebtedness includes restrictions on entering into various transactions such as acquisitions and disposals and prohibits payment of ordinary dividends they also have financial covenants including minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest payable minimum consolidated cash flow to consolidated debt service and maximum consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda all as defined in the applicable debt agreements 

as of december 31 2017  we believe we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants we expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants throughout 2018  

stock option exercises 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  we received 511 million  203 million  and 163 million  respectively of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash at the time of acquisition all amounts related to the use of cash for acquisitions discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2017  we used 479 million  of cash primarily for the acquisitions of a concert promotions business located in the united states ticketing businesses located in the united states the czech republic and poland and controlling interests in an artist management business located in the united states and a festival promotion business located in switzerland as of the date of acquisition the acquired businesses had a total of 118 million of c ash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2016 we used 2116 million  of cash primarily for the acquisitions of a concert promoter in germany controlling interests in festival and concert promoters in the united kingdom united states and sweden and an artist management business with locations in the united states and canada these businesses had a total of 390 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2015 we used 898 million  of cash primarily for the acquisitions of all or part of festival promoters located in the united states the united kingdom and sweden and a ticketing business located in canada as of the date of acquisition these businesses had a total of 1146 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

purchases and sales of noncontrolling interests net 

in 2017 we used 715 million  of cash primarily for the acquisition of an additional interest in a concert and festival promotion business located in the united states and the remaining interest in a festival promotion business located in sweden 

in 2016 we used 691 million  of cash primarily for the acquisition of all or additional equity interests in two  artist management businesses located in the united states and a festival and concert promoter located in australia 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals for amounts incurred but not yet paid for but net of expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance proceeds consisted of the following 



maintenance capital expenditures for 2017  increased from the prior year primarily associated with the relocation of certain office facilities and technology system enhancements 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2017  increased from the prior year primarily due to wifi enhancements at our amphitheaters festival site improvements and higher investment in technology 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2016  increased from the prior year primarily associated with technology system enhancements and venuerelated projects 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2016  increased from the prior year primarily due to development and enhancement of certain venues 

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  205 million  28 million  and 04 million  respectively of insurance proceeds and landlord reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 250 million for the year ending december 31 2018  

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantees and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent and deferred consideration liabilities as of december 31 2017  are as follows 



 

1    on or after november 15 2018 holders may convert their 25 convertible senior notes 

2 does not include interest on the revolving credit facility as the balance was zero as of december 31 2017  

3    commitment amounts for noncancelable operating leases and noncancelable contracts which stipulate an increase in the commitment amount based on an inflationary index have been estimated using an inflation factor of 18  for north america 29  for the united kingdom 17  for denmark and 16  for the netherlands 

4     does not include 99 million of uncertain tax positions due to the unpredictable timing of the future payments 

during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of a theatrical business we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 153 million  through the end of 2035  which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2018  through 2022  are 16 million  each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business in 2008 the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2017  

aggregate minimum rentals of 477 million  to be paid to us in years 2018  through 2032  under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 183 million  and 180 million  respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards obligations of a nonconsolidated affiliate and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended 2017  compared to year ended 2016   

cash provided by operating activities increased 255 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the prior year during 2017 our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased based on timing of payments partially offset by an increase in prepaid eventrelated expenses and lower increase in deferred revenue as compared to the prior year 

year ended 2016  compared to year ended 2015   

cash provided by operating activities increased 2896 million for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the prior year during 2016 our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased based on the timing of payments we delivered higher cashrelated net income and received more cash for future events increasing deferred revenue partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable as compared to the prior year 

investing activities 

year ended 2017  compared to year ended 2016   

cash used in investing activities decreased 989 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net payments for acquisitions partially offset by higher purchases of property plant and equipment see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

year ended 2016  compared to year ended 2015   

cash used in investing activities increased 1355 million for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the prior year due to higher acquisition activity and higher purchases of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower advances of notes receivable see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

year ended 2017  compared to year ended 2016 

cash used in financing activities increased 2263 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared to cash provided by financing activities in the prior year primarily due to net proceeds of 2673 million received in 2016 from the issuance of the 4875 senior notes and increased term loan a and term loan b borrowings after repayment of the 7 senior notes and related costs partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2017 

year ended 2016  compared to year ended 2015 

cash provided by financing activities increased 1433 million for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the prior year primarily due to net proceeds of 2673 million received in 2016 from the issuance of the 4875 senior notes and increased term loan a and term loan b borrowings after repayment of the 7 senior notes and related costs the higher net proceeds from the debt issuance were partially offset by higher purchases of noncontrolling interests and distributions to noncontrolling interest partners along with higher payments for deferred and contingent consideration due to past acquisitions 

seasonality 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur from may through october in addition the timing of when tickets are sold and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a — risk factors — “our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years” 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary’s functional currency as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 1394 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2017  by 139 million  as of december 31 2017  our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities in addition the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2017  we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of 724 million  

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 23 billion  of total debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs outstanding as of december 31 2017  of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 11 billion of fixedrate debt and 12 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2017  each 25basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 29 million  when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2017  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

we have one interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of 49 million at december 31 2017  the interest rate cap agreement ensures that a portion of our floatingrate debt does not exceed 425 and expires in june 2018 this agreement has not been designated as a hedging instrument therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the new standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services the fasb also issued important guidance clarifying certain guidelines of the standard including 1 reframing the indicators in the principal versus agent guidance to focus on evidence that a company is acting as a principal rather than agent and 2 identifying performance obligations and licensing the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within that year the guidance should be applied retrospectively either to each prior period presented in the financial statements or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption 

the table below represents the impact of the adoption on our consolidated and ticketing segment’s results of operations the impact to the consolidated results of operations includes the elimination of intercompany transactions between our concerts and ticketing segments 



a more comprehensive discussion of the revenue recognition guidance and information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements can be found in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data—note 1 —the company and summary of significant accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount when specific assets are determined to be impaired the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

when performing quantitative assessments for impairment we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts north america concerts artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the concerts segment sponsorship  advertising and international ticketing and north america ticketing within the ticketing segment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our reporting units 

the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment 

if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment and measure the impairment if any compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative the reporting unit passes the impairment test in this case we will disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and disclose which reportable segment the reporting unit is included in in both steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants we perform sensitivity analyses when the most likely result is unclear in the first and second steps in our process generally we test for sensitivities to discount rate revenue growth and market multiples which are the most significant assumptions 

the second step that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment and measure the impairment if any involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination thereof the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium a control premium represents the additional value an investor would pay in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective reporting unit 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit less those cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests it is important to note that items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expense are not part of cash flows which is more akin to our aoi metric the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

in 2017  all of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step five of the reporting units did not advance to the second step these five reporting units had improved discount rates and considerable excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests while also having mixed results on market multiples and financial results when compared to recent financial expectations further review of these reporting units with sensitivity tests did not change our first step conclusions 

the artist management reporting unit advanced to the second step and its excess of fair value over carrying value was approximately 20  the reporting unit had lower than expected financial results in the current year and decreased market multiples discount rates remained consistent with the prior year sensitivity tests on the artist management reporting unit showed that a 200basis point change in the discount rate or a 56 decline in the revenue growth rate was needed to change the conclusion it was not sensitive to market multiple changes 

finally the artist services reporting unit also advanced to the second step however due to a decrease in future financial performance expectations and risk associated with those projections the reporting unit did not pass the quantitative test this reporting unit accounts for approximately 3 of our goodwill at december 31 2017 based upon the results of the 2017 test we recorded an impairment charge of 200 million for the artist services nonmanagement reporting unit there were no impairment charges in 2016 or 2015 

given the results of the tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the show occurs revenue related to larger global tours is also recognized after the show occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally recognized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned or operated venues in the united states and where we control the tickets internationally revenue is recognized after the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges will be shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events at thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states state taxes and foreign withholding or transaction taxes on those foreign earnings that would be incurred if they were distributed it is not practicable to determine the amount of state and foreign income taxes if any that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

the effect of the international provisions of the tcja which generally establishes a territorialstyle system for taxing foreignsourced income of domestic multinational corporations is uncertain the tcja requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreignsourced subsidiaries that were previously taxdeferred and creates new taxes on certain foreignsourced earnings at december 31 2017 we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax the onetime transition tax is based on our total post1986 earnings and profits “ep” that we previously deferred from united states income taxes we recorded an estimated amount for our onetime transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries of approximately 258 million  which does not impact income tax expense for 2017 since we have reflected the transition tax liability as a reduction to existing fullyvalued tax attribute carryforwards we have not completed our calculation of the total post1986 ep for these foreign subsidiaries further the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets this amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post1986 foreign ep previously deferred from united states federal taxation and finalize 

the amounts held in cash or other specified assets no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings that we consider to be permanently reinvested 

in december 2017 the sec issued guidance to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja in accordance with this guidance we have determined that the impact of the enacted rate change and the inclusion recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings was a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate at december 31 2017 additional work is necessary for a more detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments the estimate of the transition tax inclusion does not impact income tax expense for 2017 since we have reflected the transition tax liability as a reduction to existing fullyvalued tax attribute carryforwards any subsequent adjustment to the amount will be recorded in the quarter of 2018 when the analysis is complete but is not anticipated to impact tax expense due to the existence of the aforementioned fullyvalued tax attribute carryforwards 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 



 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discounts debt issuance costs and premium and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

our strengths 

we believe we have unique resources that are unmatched in the live entertainment industry 



our history 

we were incorporated in delaware on august 2 2005 in preparation for the contribution and transfer by clear channel of substantially all of its entertainment assets and liabilities to us we completed this separation on december 21 2005 and became a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” 

on january 25 2010 we merged with ticketmaster and it became a whollyowned subsidiary of live nation effective with the merger live nation inc changed its name to live nation entertainment inc 

our industry 

we operate in these main industries within the live entertainment business live music events and associated venue operations sponsorship and advertising sales ticketing services and artist management 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or with artists directly to arrange events promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise venue sponsorships parking and premium seating 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand product or service these sponsorships typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as credit card beverage hotel and telecommunications and may include event presales and onsite product activation in addition online channels offering live streaming and musicrelated content provide opportunities for advertisers to connect their brands directly with fans and artists 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to it by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting its fee 

ticketing resale services refers to the sale of tickets by the holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue promoter or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue promoter or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

artist managers primarily provide services to music recording artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts sponsorship  advertising ticketing and artist nation 

concerts    our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world and the creation of associated content during 2016  our concerts business generated 59 billion  or 703  of our total revenue we promoted nearly 26300  live music events in 2016  including artists such as beyoncé coldplay guns n’ roses bruce springsteen  the e street band drake and adele and through festivals such as austin city limits 

lollapolooza electric daisy carnival v festival rock werchter and reading while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant associated direct operating expenses revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival promoter we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

sponsorship  advertising    our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concerts venue festivals and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we drive increased advertising scale to further monetize our concerts platform through rich media offerings including advertising associated with live streaming and musicrelated content we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets during 2016  our sponsorship  advertising business generated 378 million  or 45  of our total revenue we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through october 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and festivals and to arrange multivenue or multifestival branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a fee or “service charge” for these services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers during the year ended december 31 2016  we sold 65 27 6 and 2 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and product offerings during 2016  our ticketing business generated 18 billion  or 219  of our total revenue which excludes the face value of tickets sold through all of our ticketing services we sold 186 million  tickets in 2016  on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 298 million  tickets in total were sold using our ticketmaster systems primarily through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices for which we do not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

 we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider where we have exclusive contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute box office sales and season tickets inhouse in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and does not make those tickets available for sale by us we also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs or other similar arrangements from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales as a result we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any given client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing primarily through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally we enter into arrangements with ticket resellers to post their ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a ticket resale price determined by the ticket reseller plus a predetermined service fee to the buyer the ticket reseller receives the ticket resale price less a predetermined seller service fee 

artist nation  our artist nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists and other clients in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists our artist nation segment also creates and sells merchandise for music artists during 2016  our artist nation business generated 422 million  or 50  of our total revenue revenue earned from our artist nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent and generally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from may through october tends to be a popular time for touring events 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 



to these venues independently from an entertainment event and generates a significant amount of repeat business from local customers 

 the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2016  

 

 exclusive booking rights for festival sites includes multiyear agreements providing us the right to use public or private land for a defined period of time leading up to and continuing after the festival we may enter into multiple agreements for a single festival site or use the same site for multiple festivals we have aggregated the agreements for each festival site and reported them as one festival site 

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 



although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or financial marketing support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from both promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg dainty group another planet entertainment jam productions ltd bowery presents imp livestyle inc and frank productions in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in north america europe asia and australia aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west goldenvoice and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg aeg the madison square garden company and the nederlander organization in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues and strong local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through telephone and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services have created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events 

we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc cts eventim ag eventbrite etix and ticketfly and secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

in the artist management business we compete with other artist managers both at larger talent representation companies such as red light management as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 



 we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service operations in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol more recently some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the marks “live nation” “ticketmaster” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” and their corresponding logos we have registered many of our trademarks in numerous foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 8300 fulltime employees  including 5400 in north america and 2900 international employees of which approximately 8100 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees primarily for our live music venues and festivals as of december 31 2016  we employed approximately 6400 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 28600 seasonal employees in 2016  the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including music artists 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile as well as direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order service fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist management industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and 

tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us which could negatively impact our financial results our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season and subscription sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the federal trade commission “ftc” and the attorneys general of several individual states and statutory these restrictions include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom  website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our resale ticketing options without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any material changes to our current linking practices a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that among other things contain the unique names of venues sports teams or performers or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the artist management industry is also a highly competitive industry with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone we compete with these companies and individuals to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists in addition certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist management business are terminable at will by either party leading to competition to retain those artists as clients competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist management business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our merger with ticketmaster we became subject to both a courtimposed final judgment in the united states and a consent agreement with canadian authorities pursuant to which we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements in addition we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that would be lawful for us to undertake absent the final judgment and the consent agreement our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order and we therefore face certain unquantifiable business risks as a result of compliance 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 



 the success of our ticketing business and other operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures as well as affiliate and thirdparty computer systems wifi and other communication systems system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructures both of our own ticketing systems and other computer systems and of affiliate and thirdparty software wifi and other communications systems service providers on which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war or human error in addition the loss of some or all of certain key personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain our software and systems and could subject us to systems interruptions 

while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights 

we process store use and disclose certain personal information about our customers penetration of our network or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information and data including credit card information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation inquiries and actions from governmental authorities and financial and other liabilities in addition security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and impose significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities new variants of malware the development of new penetration methods and tools inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer information we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will continue to do so in the future we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other user data are governed by existing and evolving federal state and international laws we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions worldwide the costs associated with compliance with these regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard processes which will increase operational cost and risk 

more specifically the european union general data protection regulation “gdpr” will become effective for european union “eu” member states beginning in may 2018 this comprehensive legislation will harmonize data protection regulations across eu member states while placing many restrictions and burdens on data controllers and 

processors located both within and outside of the eu whose activities involve the personal information of residents of the eu among other requirements applicable to data controllers the gdpr contains provisions related to accountability obligations to implement document and demonstrate data protection compliance the appointment of a data protection officer consentwithdrawal of consent by data subjects transparency of information provided to data subjects data breach notifications to data subjects and international transfers of data while providing for fines that can be up to the higher of 4 of a company’s worldwide total revenue or €20 million we have committed significant capital and personnel resources to ensure that we are in compliance with the gdpr by the time it becomes effective however there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts or that violations will not occur particularly given the complexity of both the gdpr and our business as well as the uncertainties that accompany new comprehensive legislation 

our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from trying our products and services andor result in fines andor proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

 our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given 

jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance and training programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary as well as those associated with newlyacquired businesses will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition given our substantial operations in the united kingdom the “uk” and the eu we face risks and uncertainties due to the recent referendum and approval by voters in the uk of an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” these risks and uncertainties include potential deterioration in the macroeconomic environment that could lead to less demand for concerts and other live entertainment in the uk and the eu potential legal and regulatory changes that could among other things impact the ease of movement between the uk and the eu for artists and touring personnel and exchange rate risks such as the ten percent drop in the uk pound sterling against the us dollar that occurred the day after the brexit referendum which resulted in higher artist fees in pound sterling terms see the risk factor captioned “exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations” below for more discussion of the impact of currency fluctuations on our business while the full parameters and implications of brexit are currently unknown these and other factors if realized could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us 

and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams additionally governmental actions such as the current sanctions by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and certain of our subsidiaries and other aspects of our ticketing business we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2016  our international operations accounted for approximately 31  of our revenue we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate operating income of 21 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and foreign exchange rate operating losses of 245 million and 62 million for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively which impacted our operating income see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

 in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 

 we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed our failure or inability to complete future acquisitions as a result of such laws and regulations or the imposition of unfavorable terms as a condition to the completion of an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters or similar events may deter artists from touring andor substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including 

public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

in the event of actual or threatened terrorism events some artists may refuse to travel or book tours which could adversely affect our business attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks which could adversely impact our operating results the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business as well as our operating results 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through october in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact 

comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability in addition the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy which in turn could harm our results of operations 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 



 there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation in addition while we have security protocols in place at our events illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity adverse consequences including illness injury or death to the persons engaged in such activities or others and litigation against us while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we also have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations therefore litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms conditions and costs that are appropriate for our business however heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at a reasonable cost including coverage for acts of terrorism cyber attacks weatherrelated damage and other perils associated with our operations we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2016  we had property and equipment with a net book value of 7515 million  

damage andor disruption to operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with premiums and deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot guarantee that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot provide assurance that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the 

event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2016  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 515 million  was 24 billion  our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 2797 million  with outstanding letters of credit of 853 million  we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2016  533 million  of our total indebtedness excluding interest and unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs is due in 2017  3629 million  is due in the aggregate in 2018  and 2019  1945 million  is due in the aggregate in 2020  and 2021  and 18 billion  is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2016  we had 20 billion  in operating lease commitments of which 1631 million  is due in 2017  and 1560 million  is due in 2018  all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2017  see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

risks relating to our common stock 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock

executive overview

billion  a 17  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates the increase was largely driven by growth in our concerts segment with an increase in the number of events fans and the revenue we are generating onsite at the events ticketing increased as well with strong growth in concert event sales both in the united states and our international markets as well as the continued expansion of our resale business additionally sponsorship  advertising again delivered strong growth over 2015 due to a number of new strategic multiyear deals and continued growth of our festival sales as the leading global live event and ticketing company we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues and therefore drive growth across all our businesses we believe that by leveraging our leadership position in the entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience we will sell more tickets and uniquely engage more advertising partners by advancing innovation in ticketing technology we will continue to improve the fan experience by offering increased and more diversified choices in an expanded ticketing marketplace this gives us a compelling opportunity to grow our fan base and our results 

our concerts segment was the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth with an increase of 9091 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 10 billion  a 20  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates this higher revenue was partially due to additional stadium and arena shows both in the united states and internationally including tours by beyoncé rihanna coldplay and guns n’ roses we continued to expand our global festival portfolio in 2016 adding brands like governors ball to our leading roster and growing total festival attendance by 15 nearly 17 million fans attended our amphitheater shows throughout the year a record for live nation with florida georgia line dave matthews band and luke bryan all playing to sold out audiences over the summer the results of our amphitheater onsite business accelerated in 2016 with the introduction of higherend beer and wine options premium brandname food kiosks and restaurants and “grab and go” options these programs helped grow our ancillary revenue per fan by over 9 in 2016 in our international business our new promotions business in germany had an outstanding first year adding three quarters of a million new fans we also launched 20 festival apps in europe and saw our festival attendance grow by 18 yearoveryear internationally our operating income for the year improved over 2015 largely due to the impact of these business improvements and strategic initiatives mentioned above we will continue to look for expansion opportunities both domestically and internationally as well as ways to market our events more effectively in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and to sell more tickets and onsite products 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue for the year was up 439 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 507 million  a 15  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates higher revenue resulted from new clients and increased festival sponsorships in 2016 we extended agreements with several major clients for multiyear deals that utilize our venue media and ticketing assets providing our clients with a unique opportunity to advertise their brands and reward their customers with the rich diversity of live music we believe this was driven in part by our focus on introducing new amphitheater and festival products as well as adding new sales categories operating income for the year improved by 4  on a reported basis which was driven by higher revenue partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates we believe that our extensive onsite and online reach global venue distribution network artist relationships ticketing operations and live entertainment content are the key to securing longterm sponsorship agreements with major brands and we plan to expand these assets while extending further into new markets internationally 

our ticketing segment revenue for the year increased by 1884 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 2120 million  a 13  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates this increase was largely due to a 7  growth in primary ticket sales globally largely driven by increased sales for concert events in north america as well as europe as we continued to improve our platform and provide consumers with a broader range of secure ticketing options visits to our websites increased by 9 in 2016 with 63 of these visits occurring on mobile devices our resale business also grew during the year in north america europe and australia with gross transaction value or gtv improving by 24 on a reported basis yearoveryear on the mobile front 27 of our total tickets were sold via mobile and tablet devices compared to 21 in 2015 our total mobile ticket sales increased by 36 yearoveryear driven at least in part by several major improvements we made to our apps and mobile web experience in the year in 2016 we continued to invest and innovate our ticketing portfolio opening our platform to new distribution partners and providing clients with new tools operating results for the year increased over 2015 largely as a result of strong primary ticket sales as well as our growing resale ticketing business we will continue to implement new features to drive further expansion of mobile ticket transactions and invest in initiatives aimed at improving the ticket search purchase and transfer process as a result we expect to continue to attract more ticket buyers and enhance the overall fan and venue client experience 

our artist nation segment revenue for the year decreased by 125 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 76 million  a 2  decrease without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates largely driven by the timing of event activity artist nation’s operating results were lower than 2015 again driven by lower event activity our artist nation segment is focused on managing its existing clients as well as developing new relationships with top artists and extending the various services it provides 

we continue to be optimistic about the longterm potential of our company and are focused on the key elements of our business model expand our concert platform sell more tickets and invest in product improvements grow resale ticket volume and expand sponsorship and advertising results

our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world and the creation of associated content while our concerts segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year

key operating metrics   



  

 

nongaap measures 

reconciliation of segment adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration obligations and acquisitionrelated severance and compensation depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment loss gain on disposal of operating assets and certain stockbased compensation expense   we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of aoi to operating income loss 



constant currency 

constant currency is a nongaap financial measure we calculate currency impacts as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prior period’s currency exchange rates we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations

operating results 

the improved operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31 2016  was primarily driven by strong operating results for our worldwide stadium events and north america amphitheaters and festivals partially offset by higher compensation costs associated with annual salary increases and incentive compensation as a result of the increased operating results and loss of certain rent credits received in 2015

concerts revenue increased 2381 million or 5 during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year excluding the decrease of 2606 million related to currency impacts revenue increased 4987 million or 11 primarily due to more shows in our north america arenas and amphitheaters touring events in asia and australia and incremental revenue of 2033 million from the acquisitions of various festival and concert promoters these increases were partially offset by fewer shows in north america stadiums 

operating results 

the improved operating results for concerts for the year ended december 31 2015 was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment of 1170 million related to our international concerts business that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 in connection with our annual impairment test this was partially offset by higher amortization associated with certain revenue generating contracts due to the timing of artists touring acceleration of depreciation and amortization associated with a change in the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets and leasehold improvements along with increased compensation costs associated with annual salary increases and headcount growth and higher valuation allowances

consolidated results of operations 



 

corporate

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 15 billion  at december 31 2016  and 13 billion  at december 31 2015  included in the december 31 2016  and 2015  cash and cash equivalents balance is 5910 million  and 5490 million  respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges that we refer to as client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 7125 million  in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2016  we do not intend to repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 23 billion  and 20 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes was 38  at december 31 2016  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaid expenses this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly depending on economic conditions at the time we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default

debt covenants 

our senior secured credit facility contains a number of restrictions that among other things require us to satisfy a financial covenant and restrict our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt make certain investments and acquisitions repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness create liens enter into agreements with affiliates modify the nature of our business enter into saleleaseback transactions transfer and sell material assets merge or consolidate and pay dividends and make distributions with the exception of subsidiary dividends or distributions to the parent company or other subsidiaries on at least a prorata basis with any noncontrolling interest partners noncompliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable the senior secured credit facility agreement has one covenant measured quarterly that relates to total leverage the consolidated total leverage covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the credit agreement of 550 x over the trailing four  consecutive quarters through september 30 2017 the consolidated total leverage ratio will reduce to 525 x on december 31 2017 50 x on december 31 2018 475 x on december 31 2019 and 450 x on december 31 2020 

the indentures governing our 4875 senior notes and 5375 senior notes contain covenants that limit among other things our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments sell certain assets agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us merge consolidate or sell all of our assets create certain liens and engage in transactions with affiliates on terms that are not on an armslength basis certain covenants including those pertaining to incurrence of indebtedness restricted payments asset sales mergers and transactions with affiliates will be suspended during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both rating agencies and no default or event of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing the 4875 senior notes and the 5375 senior notes contain two  incurrencebased 

financial covenants as defined requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 x and a maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio of 350 x

stock option exercises 

during 2016  2015  and 2014  we received 203 million  163 million  and 218 million respectively of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash at the time of acquisition all amounts related to the use of cash for acquisitions discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2016  we used 2116 million  of cash primarily for the acquisitions of a concert promoter in germany controlling interests in festival and concert promoters in the united kingdom united states and sweden and an artist management business with locations in the united states and canada these businesses had a total of 390 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2015 we used 898 million  of cash primarily for the acquisitions of all or part of festival promoters located in the united states the united kingdom and sweden and a ticketing business located in canada as of the date of acquisition these businesses had a total of 1146 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2014 we used 2102 million  of cash primarily for acquisitions of a controlling interest in a festival and concert promoter located in the united states and acquisitions of artist management businesses located in the united states as of the date of acquisition these businesses had a total of 346 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

purchases and sales of noncontrolling interests net 

in 2016 we used 691 million  of cash primarily for the acquisition of all or additional equity interests in two  artist management businesses located in the united states and a festival and concert promoter located in australia 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance proceeds consisted of the following 



maintenance capital expenditures for 2016  increased from the prior year primarily associated with technology system enhancements and venuerelated projects 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2016  increased from the prior year primarily due to development and enhancement of certain venues 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2015  increased from the prior year primarily due to technology product enhancements 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2015  decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower expenditures related to the replatforming of our ticketing system and development of our integrated resale and primary product 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  28 million  04 million  and 44 million  respectively of insurance proceeds and landlord reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 220 million for the year ending december 31 2017  

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent and deferred consideration liabilities as of december 31 2016  are as follows 



1    on or after november 15 2018 holders may convert their 25 convertible senior notes 

2 does not include interest on the revolving credit facility as the balance was zero as of december 31 2016  

3    commitment amounts for noncancelable operating leases and noncancelable contracts which stipulate an increase in the commitment amount based on an inflationary index have been estimated using an inflation factor of 19  for north america 30  for the united kingdom 18  for denmark and 17  for the netherlands 

4     does not include 83 million of uncertain tax positions due to the unpredictable timing of the future payments 

 

during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of a theatrical business we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 169 million  through the end of 2035  which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2017  through 2021  are 16 million  each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business in 2008 the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2016  

aggregate minimum rentals of 574 million  to be paid to us in years 2017  through 2023  under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 180 million  and 134 million  respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended 2016  compared to year ended 2015   

cash provided by operating activities increased 2896 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the prior year during 2016 our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased based on the timing of payments we delivered higher cashrelated net income and received more cash for future events increasing deferred revenue partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable as compared to the prior year 

year ended 2015  compared to year ended 2014   

cash provided by operating activities increased 157 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year during 2015 we made less advances to artists for future events decreasing our prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities based on the timing of payments as compared to the prior year 

investing activities 

year ended 2016  compared to year ended 2015   

cash used in investing activities increased 1355 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the prior year due to higher acquisition activity and higher purchases of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower advances of notes receivable see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

year ended 2015  compared to year ended 2014   

cash used in investing activities decreased 1012 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net acquisition expenditures in 2015 as compared to the prior year see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

year ended 2016  compared to year ended 2015 

cash provided by financing activities increased 1433 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the prior year primarily due to net proceeds of 2673 million received in 2016 from the issuance of the 4875 senior notes and increased term loan a and term loan b borrowings after repayment of the 7 senior notes and related costs the higher net proceeds from the debt issuance were partially offset by higher purchases of noncontrolling interests and distributions to noncontrolling interest partners along with higher payments for deferred and contingent consideration due to past acquisitions 

year ended 2015  compared to year ended 2014 

cash used in financing activities increased 2701 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of net proceeds of 2938 million received in 2014 from the issuance of the 5375 senior notes and 25 convertible senior notes after repayment of the 2875 convertible senior notes 

seasonality 

our concerts sponsorship  advertising and artist nation segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur from may through october and our artist touring activity is higher in addition the timing of when tickets are sold and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a — risk factors —“ our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years” 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary’s functional currency as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 720 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2016  by 72 million  as of december 31 2016  our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities in addition the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2016  we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of 1738 million  

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 24 billion  of total debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs outstanding as of december 31 2016  of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 12 billion of fixedrate debt and 12 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2016  each 25basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 30 million  when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2016  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

we have one interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of 63 million  at december 31 2016  the interest rate cap agreement ensures that a portion of our floatingrate debt does not exceed 425 and expires in june 2018 this agreement has not been designated as a hedging instrument therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

recent accounting pronouncements 

information regarding recent accounting pronouncements can be found in item 8— financial statements and supplementary data—note 1—the company and summary of significant accounting policies 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount when specific assets are determined to be impaired the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

when performing quantitative assessments for impairment we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows discount rates and royalty rates as well as other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts and north america concerts within the concerts segment sponsorship  advertising international ticketing and north america ticketing within the ticketing segment and artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the artist nation segment 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a threestep process we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our operating segments or reporting units 

the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the third step employed for any reporting unit that fails the second step is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative we do not follow this threestep process in this case a qualitative evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired if it is the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill described above is performed in all three steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants we perform sensitivity analyses when the most likely result is unclear in the first step and for both the second and third steps in our process generally we test for sensitivities to discount rate revenue growth market multiples and customer attrition which are the most significant assumptions 

the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination thereof the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium a control premium represents the additional value an investor would pay in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective reporting unit 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit less those cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests it is important to note that items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expense are not part of cash flows which is 

more akin to our aoi metric the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate the attrition rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

in 2016  all of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step five of the reporting units did not advance to the second step three of these five reporting units had improved discount rates and considerable excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests while also having mixed results on market multiples and financial results when compared to recent financial expectations two out of the five reporting units had varying financial results as compared to recent financial expectations for the current year with slight decreases in market multiples but both had a significant excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests along with improved discount rates any further review of these reporting units with sensitivity tests did not change our first step conclusions 

the artist management and artist services reporting units advanced to the second step and their excess of fair value over carrying value ranged from 20  to 31  although both of these reporting units had lower financial results in the current year and mixed results on their market multiples they had improvements on discount rates sensitivity tests on the artist management reporting unit showed that a 300basis point change in the discount rate an 81 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 235basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion sensitivity tests on the artist services reporting unit showed that a 220basis point change in the discount rate a 71 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 306basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion 

given the results of the tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe any of our reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the show occurs revenue related to larger global tours is also recognized after the show occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally recognized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned or operated venues in the united states and where we control the tickets internationally revenue is recognized after the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges will be shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events at thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations the amount of earnings at december 31 2016  that has been earned over time and permanently reinvested was approximately 14 billion  it is not practical to determine the amount 

of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 



 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discounts debt issuance costs and premium and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues

our industry 

we operate in five main industries within the live entertainment business live music events venue operations ticketing services artist management and services and sponsorship and advertising sales 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or with artists to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from artists for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to have their venues rented for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise venue sponsorships parking and premium seating 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting its fee 

ticketing resale services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue promoter or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue promoter or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

artist managers primarily provide services to music recording artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings artist services creates and sells merchandise for music artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet and also connects artists to corporate clients for events and generally are paid a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand or product the advertising campaigns typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage hotel and telecommunications these 

promotional programs may include event presales and onsite product activation in addition online channels offering live streaming and musicrelated original content provide opportunities for advertisers to connect their brands directly with fans and artists 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing artist nation and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts    our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world and the creation of associated content during 2015  our concerts business generated approximately 50 billion  or 685  of our total revenue we promoted over 25500  live music events in 2015  including artists such as u2 fleetwood mac acdc one direction maroon 5 and luke bryan and through festivals such as electric daisy carnival rock werchter austin city limits lollapolooza and bonnaroo while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant associated direct operating expenses revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival promoter we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for third parties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a fee or “service charge” for these services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers during the year ended december 31 2015  we sold 69 21  7 and 3 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and bundled product offerings during 2015  our ticketing business generated approximately 16 billion  or 226  of our total revenue which excludes the face value of tickets sold through all of our ticketing services we sold 160 million  tickets in 2015  on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 297 million  tickets in total were sold using our ticketmaster systems through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices for which we do not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

 we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider where we have exclusive contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of 

thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute group sales and season tickets inhouse in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and does not make those tickets available for sale by us we also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs or other similar arrangements from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales as a result we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any single client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services sometimes referred to as secondary ticketing primarily through our integrated inventory platform leagueteam platforms and other platforms internationally we enter into arrangements with ticket resellers to post their ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a ticket resale price determined by the ticket reseller plus a predetermined service fee to the buyer we remit the ticket resale price to the ticket resellers less a predetermined service fee to the seller in addition to enabling premium primary ticket sales certain services allow consumers to resell and purchase tickets online or via mobile devices for certain events for our venue clients who elect to participate in the service sellers and buyers each pay a fee that has been negotiated with the relevant client a portion of which may be shared with the client 

artist nation  our artist nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists and other clients in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists our artist nation segment also creates and sells merchandise for music artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet during 2015  our artist nation business generated approximately 434 million  or 60  of our total revenue revenue earned from our artist nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent and generally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from may through october tends to be a popular time for touring events 

sponsorship  advertising    our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concerts venue artist relationship and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we drive increased advertising scale to further monetize our concerts platform through rich media offerings including advertising associated with live streaming and musicrelated original content we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets during 2015  our sponsorship  advertising business generated approximately 334 million  or 46  of our total revenue we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through october 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 

 

because theaters can be used yearround unlike most amphitheaters they can generate annual profits similar to those of an amphitheater theaters represent less risk to concert promoters because they have lower fixed costs associated with hosting a concert and may provide a more appropriatelysized venue for developing artists and more artists in general 

 the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2015  



competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or financial marketing support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from both promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg another planet entertainment jam productions ltd bowery presents imp and sfx entertainment in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in north america europe asia and australia aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west goldenvoice and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg aeg the madison square garden company and the nederlander organization in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online and mobile channels but also through telephone and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts has created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby certain brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale despite prohibition on such actions the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc and cts eventim ag online and event companies such as eventbrite etix and ticketfly and secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

in the artist management business we compete with other artist managers both at larger talent representation companies such as red light management as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals in the artist services business we compete with companies typically only involved in one or a few of the services we provide some of these competitors include bravado artist arena and global merchandising services 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues and strong local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 

 we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data an area that is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol more recently some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods or mandate ticket inventory disclosure 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the marks “live nation” “ticketmaster” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” and their corresponding logos we have registered many of our trademarks in numerous foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 7700 fulltime employees  including 5000 in north america and 2700 international employees of which approximately 7500 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees primarily for our live music venues and festivals as of december 31 2015  we employed approximately 9000 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 19300 seasonal employees in 2015  the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage and our common stock if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business and operations 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss of the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including musical artists 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and mobile as well as direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order “order processing” fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist management industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and who have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists due to increasing artist influence and competition to attract and maintain artist clients we may enter into agreements on terms that are less favorable to us which could negatively impact our financial results our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season subscription or group sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the ftc and the attorneys general of several individual states and statutory these restrictions include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom  website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our resale ticketing options without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any material changes to our current linking practices a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that among other things contain the unique names of venues sports teams or performers or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the artist management industry is also a highly competitive industry with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone we compete with these companies and individuals to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists in addition certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist management business are terminable at will by either party leading to competition to retain those artists as clients competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist management business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our merger with ticketmaster we became subject to both a courtimposed final judgment in the united states and a consent agreement with canadian authorities pursuant to which we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements in addition we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that would be lawful for us to undertake absent the final judgment and the consent agreement our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order and we therefore face certain unquantifiable business risks as a result of compliance 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures system interruption the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information technology systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we lack documentation regarding certain components of our key ticketing software and systems operations and rely on certain key technology personnel to maintain such software and systems the loss of some or all of such personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain such software and systems and could subject us to frequent systems interruptions 

we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in their systems infrastructures or businesses or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair our ability to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism other acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

due to the internetbased nature of a significant portion of our ticketing and other businesses we process store use and disclose large amounts of data including personal information for our customers any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information and data including credit card information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation and other liabilities network security issues could lead to claims against us for others’ misuse of personal information such as for credit card fraud or identity theft which could result in litigation and financial liabilities as well as administrative action from governmental authorities in addition security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and impose significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring or repair costs for impacted customers although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent 

data loss and other security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries undetected fraud inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data recently large retailers and website operators have been the victims of targeted security breaches resulting in the disclosure andor misappropriation of large amounts of customer data including credit card information we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any such potential security breaches and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will be required to continue to do so in the future we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other user data are governed by federal state and international laws specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions worldwide the costs associated with compliance with these regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard deployment mechanisms which will increase operational cost and risk 

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by us our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from trying our products and services andor result in fines andor proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

 

 our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary as well as those associated with newlyacquired businesses will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or 

unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams additionally governmental actions such as the recent sanctions by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and certain of our subsidiaries and other aspects of our ticketing business we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have experienced labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2015  our international operations accounted for approximately 30  of our revenue we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate operating losses of 245 million 62 million and 04 million for the years ended 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively which had a negative impact on our operating income see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings including those described in note 6 —commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated financial statements may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

 in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 

 we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed our failure or inability to complete future acquisitions as a result of such laws and regulations or the imposition of unfavorable terms as a condition to the completion of an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters or similar events may deter artists from touring andor substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military 

actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following recent and past terrorism events including those that directly targeted music venues some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our business attendance at events may decline due to fears over terrorism and contagious disease outbreaks which could adversely impact our operating results the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business as well as our operating results 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our 

festivals primarily occur during may through october in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability in addition the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy which in turn could harm our results of operations 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 



 there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation in addition while we have security protocols in place at our events illegal drug use or alcohol consumption at our events could result in negative publicity adverse consequences including illness injury or death to the persons engaged in such activities or others and litigation against us while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

we have generally registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation while we vigorously protect our trademarks service marks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property rights successfully or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our businesses have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions we 

consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or identify inventions and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain accordingly any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology in addition third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

we currently secure insurance programs to address our various risks with terms conditions and costs that are appropriate for live nation’s business however heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at a reasonable cost including coverage for acts of terrorism cyber attacks weatherrelated damage and other perils associated with our operations we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2015  we had property and equipment with a net book value of 7313 million  

damage andor disruption to operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with premiums and deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our business locations or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our business facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2015  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of 414 million  and including debt premium of 60 million  was 21 billion  our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 2589 million  with outstanding letters of credit of 761 million  we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2015  425 million  of our total indebtedness excluding interest premium and unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs is due in 2016  4046 million  is due in the aggregate in 2017  and 2018  14 billion  is due in the aggregate in 2019  and 2020  and 2736 million  is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2015  we had 21 billion  in operating lease commitments of which 1485 million  is due in 2016  and 1441 million  is due in 2017  all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2016  see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

risks relating to our common stock 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring 

potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock

 item 2   properties 

as of december 31 2015  we own operate or lease 93  entertainment venues and 130 other facilities including office leases throughout north america and 36  entertainment venues and 90 other facilities internationally we believe our venues and facilities are generally wellmaintained and in good operating condition and have adequate capacity to meet our current business needs we have a lease ending june 30 2020 for our corporate headquarters in beverly hills california used primarily by our executive group and certain of our domestic operations management staff 

our leases are for varying terms ranging from monthly to multiyear these leases can typically be for terms of 3 to 5 years for our office leases and 10 to 20 years for our venue leases and many include renewal options there is no significant concentration of venues under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord we believe that an important part of our management activity is to negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions

dividend policy 

since the separation and through december 31 2015  we have not declared or paid any dividends we presently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business and to make debt repayments as they become due therefore we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future moreover the terms of our senior secured credit facility limit the amount of funds that we will have available to declare and distribute as dividends on our common stock payment of future cash dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable laws after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs plans for expansion and contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections about our industry business and future financial results our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those discussed under 1a—risk factors and other sections in this annual report 

executive overview 

2015 is live nation’s 10 th  anniversary since becoming a publiclytraded company and the year included many exciting milestones our total revenue for the year was 72 billion  a record level for the company all of our segments reported revenue growth for the fifth consecutive year as a result of both our highest level of attendance at our concerts and record ticket sales in our ticketing business more than ever we are seeing the unique power of the live concert experience and the importance of technology to enable fans around the world to connect with artists and each other our overall revenue in 2015 increased by 3788 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 7383 million  an 11  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates while all our segments contributed to this success the increase was largely driven 

by growth in our concerts segment due to an increase in the number of events and fans ticketing increased as well with growth in concerts and sporting event ticket sales globally as well as the continued expansion of our resale business additionally sponsorship  advertising again delivered strong growth over 2014 due to higher sales for our festivals as well as new partnerships in australia and asia higher artist management commissions and sportsrelated revenue in artist nation led to an increase in overall revenue for that segment as well as the leading global live event and ticketing company we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues and therefore drive growth across all our businesses we believe that by leveraging our leadership position in the entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience we will sell more tickets and uniquely engage more advertising partners by advancing innovation in ticketing technology we will continue to improve the fan experience by offering increased and more diversified choices in an expanded ticketing marketplace this gives us a compelling opportunity to grow our fan base and our results 

our concerts segment was the largest contributor to our overall revenue growth with an increase of 2381 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 4987 million  an 11  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates the higher revenue was partially due to additional arena shows globally and an overall increase in attendance at arena shows this year some of the artists driving this increase included u2 madonna maroon 5 and ariana grande in addition the ongoing expansion of our festival portfolio in north america drove growth in attendance for festival events with such wellknown brands as lollapalooza and bonnaroo joining our roster we continue to see great success in our european festivals such as rock werchter and reading as well as electronic events including electric daisy carnival and creamfields over 15 million fans attended our amphitheater shows throughout the year which is a record for live nation where kid rock luke bryan and 5 seconds of summer played to sold out audiences over the summer our efforts to enhance our amphitheater onsite business got off to a great start in 2015 with our new food and beverage and point of sale partners offering more selections and a faster transaction process in our international business we saw growth in our new asian markets  thailand taiwan and indonesia  while large tours by the popular korean act bigbang as well as fleetwood mac in australia grew ticket revenue in our panasian business this growth more than offset a decline in stadium activity in both north america and europe which is a function of the mix of artists touring in the year our operating income for the year improved over 2014 largely due to the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2014 which was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization in 2015 we will continue to look for expansion opportunities both domestically and internationally as well as ways to market our events more effectively in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and to sell more tickets and onsite products 

our ticketing segment revenue for the year increased by 823 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 1563 million  a 10  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates this increase was largely due to a 4  growth in primary ticket sales globally driven by increased sales for concert and sporting events as we continued to improve our platform and provide consumers with a broader range of secure ticketing options visits to our websites increased by 10 in 2015 with nearly 60 of these visits occurring on mobile devices our resale business also grew during the year in north america europe and australia with gross transaction value or gtv improving by 32 on a reported basis yearoveryear mobile continues to be an area of focus and innovation for us and in 2015 21 of our total tickets were sold via mobile and tablet devices and our total mobile ticket sales increased by 20 yearoveryear operating results for the year increased over 2015 largely as a result of strong primary ticket sales as well as our growing resale ticketing business we will continue to implement new features to drive further expansion of mobile ticket transactions and invest in initiatives aimed at improving the ticket search purchase and transfer process as a result we expect to attract more ticket buyers and enhance the overall fan and venue client experience 

our artist nation segment revenue for the year increased by 448 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 514 million  a 13  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates driven by higher management commissions and sportsrelated revenue artist nation’s operating results were flat to 2014 as the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2014 was largely offset by higher investment in new business lines in 2015 as well as higher amortization associated with recent acquisitions our artist nation segment is focused on managing its existing clients as well as developing new relationships with top artists and extending the various services it provides 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue for the year was up 334 million  on a reported basis as compared to last year or 516 million  a 17  increase without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates higher revenue resulted from new clients increased festival sponsorships and expansion of our business in australia and asia all of which also increased our operating income our growth has been driven by the expansion of our festival footprint and engaging new sponsor clients with both our existing events and new brands added to our festival family operating income for the year improved by 5  on a reported basis which was driven by higher revenue partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates we believe that our extensive onsite and online reach global venue distribution network artist relationships ticketing operations and live entertainment content are the key to securing longterm sponsorship agreements with major brands and we plan to expand these assets while extending further into new markets internationally

our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues the production of music festivals across the world and the creation of associated content while our concerts segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through october revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration arrangements and acquisitionrelated severance depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment loss gain on disposal of operating assets and noncash and certain stockbased compensation expense including expense associated with grants of certain stockbased awards which were classified as liabilities   we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of adjusted operating income loss to operating income loss 



liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 13 billion  at december 31 2015  and 14 billion  at december 31 2014  included in the december 31 2015  and 2014  cash and cash equivalents balance is 5490 million  and 5338 million  respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges that we refer to as client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 5500 million  in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2015  we do not intend to repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 20 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs and including the debt premium on our term loans and notes was 42  at december 31 2015  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaid expenses this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly depending on economic conditions at the time we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default

stock option exercises 

during 2015  2014  and 2013  we received 163 million  218 million  and 851 million respectively of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash at the time of acquisition all amounts discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2015  we used 998 million  of cash primarily for the acquisitions of all or part of festival promoters located in the united states the united kingdom and sweden in our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments and a ticketing business located in canada in our ticketing segment as of the date of acquisition these businesses had a total of 1146 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2014 we used 2102 million  of cash primarily for acquisitions of a controlling interest in a festival and concert promoter located in the united states in our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments and acquisitions of artist management businesses located in the united states in our artist nation segment as of the date of acquisition these businesses had a total of 346 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

during 2013 we used 935 million  of cash primarily for acquisitions of controlling interests in festival promoters located in the united states and the united kingdom both in our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments along with the acquisition in our artist nation segment of an artist management business located in the united kingdom as of the date of acquisition these businesses had a total of 309 million of cash on their balance sheets primarily related to deferred revenue for future events 

purchases of noncontrolling interests 

during 2013 we used 509 million of cash primarily for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in a company that owns the 3arena in ireland there were no significant acquisitions of noncontrolling interests during 2015 and 2014 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance companies consisted of the following 



maintenance capital expenditures for 2015  increased from the prior year primarily due to technology product enhancements 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2015  decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower expenditures related to the replatforming of our ticketing system and development of our integrated resale and primary product 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2014  increased from the prior year primarily due to an increase in venuerelated projects and higher investments in technology and development of innovative new products 

for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  04 million  44 million  and 247 million  respectively of insurance proceeds and landlord reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above included in this total for 2013 is 185 million of insurance proceeds excluded from revenue generating capital expenditures to restore an amphitheater in new york that sustained storm damage 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 165 million for the year ending december 31 2016  

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and premium future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2015  are as follows 



1    on or after november 2018 holders may convert their 25 convertible senior notes 

2 does not include interest on the revolving credit facility as the balance was zero as of december 31 2015  

3    commitment amounts for noncancelable operating leases and noncancelable contracts which stipulate an increase in the commitment amount based on an inflationary index have been estimated using an inflation factor of 21  for north america 32  for the united kingdom and 18  for the netherlands 

4     does not include 72 million of uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of the future payments 

 

during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 184 million  through the end of 2035  which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2016  through 2020  are 16 million  each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business in 2008 the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2015  

aggregate minimum rentals of 695 million  to be received in years 2016  through 2023  under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 134 million  and 131 million  respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended 2015  compared to year ended 2014   

cash provided by operating activities was 3002 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 2773 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the 229 million  increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing of ticket sales and advances to artist during 2015 we made lower payments for eventrelated expenses partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable as compared to the prior year 

year ended 2014  compared to year ended 2013   

cash provided by operating activities was 2773 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 4314 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the 1541 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing of ticket sales along with the size and number of future events during 2014 this change was primarily due to an increase in prepaid eventrelated expenses driven by the timing of artist advances partially offsetting this use of operating cash was an increase in the cash portion of net income driven by growth in operating results in 2014 

investing activities 

year ended 2015  compared to year ended 2014   

cash used in investing activities was 2910 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 3922 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  the 1012 million  decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to lower net acquisition expenditures in 2015 as compared to the prior year see “—sources of cash” and “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

year ended 2014  compared to year ended 2013   

cash used in investing activities was 3922 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 1576 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the 2346 million increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher payments for acquisitions and lower proceeds received from the disposal of operating assets as compared to the prior year see “—sources of cash” and “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

year ended 2015  compared to year ended 2014 

cash used in financing activities was 365 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to cash provided by financing activities of 2409 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  t he 2773 million  decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily a result of 2938 million of net proceeds received in 2014 from the issuance of the 5375 senior notes and 25 convertible senior notes after repayment of the 2875 convertible senior notes 

year ended 2014  compared to year ended 2013 

cash provided by financing activities was 2409 million for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 330 million for the year ended december 31 2013 the 2079 million increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily a result of higher net proceeds from the issuance of the 5375 senior notes and 25 convertible senior notes after repayment of the 2875 convertible senior notes and lower payments for purchases of noncontrolling interests partially offset by lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 as compared to the prior year 

seasonality 

our concerts artist nation and sponsorship  advertising segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur from may through october and our artist touring activity is higher in addition the timing of when tickets are sold and tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment revenue is impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues and festivals in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a — risk factors —“ our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years” 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary’s functional currency as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 1018 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2015  by 102 million  as of december 31 2015  our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2015  we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of 711 million  

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 21 billion  of total debt excluding debt discounts issuance costs and premium outstanding as of december 31 2015  of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 10 billion of fixedrate debt and 11 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2015  each 25basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 27 million when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2015  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

we have one interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of 82 million  at december 31 2015  the interest rate cap agreement ensures that a portion of our floatingrate debt does not exceed 425 and expires in june 2018 this agreement has not been designated as a hedging instrument therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted pronouncements 

in april 2014 the fasb issued guidance that raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation   we adopted this guidance on january 1 2015 and there has been no impact from its adoption 

in april 2015 the fasb issued guidance that simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs the guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within that year the guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented in the financial statements early adoption is permitted and we adopted this guidance effective january 1 2015 

in september 2015 the fasb issued guidance that eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurementperiod adjustments retrospectively instead acquirers recognize measurementperiod adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date the guidance should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date this guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within that year early adoption is permitted and we adopted this guidance effective july 1 2015 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in february 2015 the fasb issued amendments to the consolidation guidance that make changes to the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities this guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within that year the guidance should be applied either using a modified retrospective approach or retrospectively early adoption is permitted and we adopted this guidance on october 1 2015 the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in november 2015 the fasb issued updated guidance that requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in the statement of financial position the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within that year the guidance should be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented early adoption is permitted and we adopted this guidance effective october 1 2015 we applied the guidance prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities prior periods presented have not been retrospectively adjusted the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position 

recently issued pronouncements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the new standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within that year early adoption of the standard is only permitted for annual periods beginning after december 31 2016 and interim periods within that year the guidance should be applied retrospectively either to each prior 

period presented in the financial statements or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we will adopt this standard on january 1 2018 and we are currently assessing which implementation method we will apply and the impact its adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 

in april 2015 the fasb amended its guidance on internaluse software providing guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses if a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract the amendments to this guidance are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within that year and early adoption is permitted the guidance should be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively we will adopt this guidance on january 1 2016 and will apply it prospectively the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in january 2016 the fasb issued amendments for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments among other things the guidance requires equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method to be measured at fair value with any change in fair value recognized in net income unless the investments do not have readily determinable fair values the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within that year early adoption is not permitted for most of the amendments the amendments are to be applied through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption with the exception of equity investments without readily determinable fair value which will be applied prospectively we will adopt this standard on january 1 2018 and are currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our financial position and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

typically we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount when specific assets are determined to be impaired the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

when performing quantitative assessments for impairment we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts and north american concerts within the concerts segment artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the artist nation segment international ticketing and north american ticketing within the ticketing segment and sponsorship  advertising 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a threestep process we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our operating segments or reporting units 

the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless it is our policy that all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the third step employed for any reporting unit that fails the second step is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative we do not follow this three step process in this case a qualitative evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired if it is the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill described above is performed in all three steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants we perform sensitivity 

analyses when the most likely result is unclear in the first step and for both the second and third steps in our process generally we test for sensitivities to discount rate revenue growth market multiples and customer attrition which are the most significant assumptions 

the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination thereof the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium a control premium represents the additional value an investor would pay in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit less those cash flows attributable to noncontrolling interests it is important to note that items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expense are not part of cash flows which is more akin to our aoi metric the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate the attrition rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

in 2015 three of our reporting units advanced directly to the second step in accordance with our policy because it had been five years since we had performed the second step for these reporting units these reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying value ranging from 24 to 480 so no further analysis was required these reporting units had significant improvements in their discount rates and market multiples as compared to the last quantitative analysis performed two of these reporting units outperformed their recent financial expectations for the current year the third reporting unit had a slight decline in financial results however sensitivity tests on this reporting unit showed that a 150 basis point change in the discount rate a 50 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 380 basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion 

the remaining four of our reporting units with goodwill were assessed under the first qualitative step two of these reporting units advanced to the second step as discussed below while the two reporting units that did not advance to the second step had mixed financial results as compared to recent financial expectations for the current year both had a significant excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests improved discount rates and consistent market multiples we did not identify any reporting units with sensitivity test results that would change our first step conclusions 

the artist management and artist services reporting units advanced to the second step and their excess of fair value over carrying value ranged from 15  to 18  although both of these reporting units had lower financial results in the current year they had improvements in their market multiples and either improving or consistent discount rates sensitivity tests on the artist management reporting unit showed that a 150 basis point change in the discount rate a 30 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 120 basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion sensitivity tests on the artist services reporting unit showed that a 150 basis point change in the discount rate a 10 decline in the revenue growth rate or a 340 basis point change in market multiples was needed to change the conclusion 

given the results of the tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe any of our reporting units with the exception of artist services are at risk of failing the second step in the near future due to its sensitivity to revenue declines we believe that the artist services reporting unit could be at risk of failing the second step in the future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the show occurs revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the show occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from 

sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned or operated venues in the united states and where we control the tickets internationally revenue is recognized after the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs and these service charges will be shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events at thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations the amount of earnings at december 31 2015  that has been earned over time and permanently reinvested was approximately 12 billion  it is not practical to determine the amount of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that any remaining available cash associated with these earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 



 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discounts debt issuance costs and premium and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues

on january 25 2010 we merged with ticketmaster and it became a whollyowned subsidiary of live nation effective with the merger live nation inc changed its name to live nation entertainment inc 

our industry 

we operate in five main industries within the live entertainment business including live music events venue operations ticketing services sponsorship and advertising sales and artist management and services 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents directly contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with artists to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from artists for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise venue sponsorships parking and premium seating 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone mobile devices outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting their fee as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

ticketing resale services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue promoter or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue promoter or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

artist managers primarily provide services to music recording artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings artist services creates and sells merchandise for music artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet and also connects artists to corporate clients for events and generally are paid a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand or product the advertising campaigns typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online banner advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage hotel and telecommunications these promotional programs may include event presales and onsite product activation 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing artist nation and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world during 2014  our concerts business generated approximately 47 billion  or 688  of our total revenue we promoted 22800  live music events in 2014  including artists such as one direction jayz  beyonce justin timberlake luke bryan jason aldean and lady gaga and through festivals such as electric daisy carnival rock werchter reading and t in the park while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through september 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it revenue generated from venue operations typically has a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically has a more direct relationship to changes in operating income 

as a festival producer we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also provide or arrange for thirdparties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a fixed fee or a percentage of the total convenience charge and order processing fee for its services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers during the year ended december 31 2014  we sold 69 18  9 and 4 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and bundled product offerings during 2014  our ticketing business generated approximately 16 billion  or 227  of our total revenue which excludes the face value of tickets sold through all of our ticketing services we sold 154 million  tickets in 2014  on which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 300 million  tickets in total were sold using our ticketmaster systems through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices for which we do not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients 

we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world in order to provide stateoftheart ticketing technology services we are currently in the process of replatforming portions of our ticketmaster ticketing system which we believe will result in an improved experience for our fans and better tools and information resources for our venue clients we started this replatforming for our north america business in 2011 and currently expect to start using the new technology at certain of our venue clients in 2015 in addition to providing improved technology products we believe that once this replatforming is complete and rolled out to all our clients it will allow us to improve the efficiency of our ticketing systems and processes and lead to cost reductions 

we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider where we have exclusive contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute group sales and season tickets inhouse in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and does not make those tickets available for sale by us we also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs or other similar arrangements from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales as a result we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any single client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services or secondary ticketing through our integrated inventory platform referred to as tm ticketsnow in the united states and canada our ticketexchange service in the united states europe and canada and get me in in the united kingdom we enter into listing agreements with ticket resellers to post their ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a ticket resale price determined by the ticket reseller plus an amount equal to a percentage of the ticket resale price and a predetermined service fee we remit the ticket resale price to the ticket resellers and retain the remainder of the purchase price as our fee while we do not generally acquire tickets for sale on our own behalf we may do so from time to time on a limited basis in addition to enabling premium primary ticket sales the ticketexchange service allows consumers to resell and purchase tickets online for certain events for our venue clients who elect to participate in the ticketexchange service sellers and buyers each pay a fee that has been negotiated with the relevant client a portion of which may be shared with the client 

artist nation  our artist nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists our artist nation segment also creates and sells merchandise for music artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet during 2014  our artist nation business generated approximately 389 million  or 57  of our total revenue revenue earned from our artist nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent and generally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from may through september tends to be a popular time for touring events 

sponsorship  advertising our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert venue artist relationship and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our clients’ specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients’ consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets during 2014  our sponsorship  advertising business generated approximately 300 million  or 44  of our total revenue we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur from may through september 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for advertisers our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories 

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venue types generally consist of 

 

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2014  



competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or financial marketing support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from both promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

some of our competitors in the live music industry are anschutz entertainment group or aeg another planet entertainment jam productions ltd imp and sfx entertainment in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos and venues in north america and europe aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west goldenvoice and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg aeg and the nederlander organization in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through telephone mobile devices and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale or secondary ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts has created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby brokers are using automated internet “bot” technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc veritix and cts eventim ag online and event companies such as eventbrite etix and ticketfly and secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

in the artist management business we compete with other artist managers both at larger talent representation companies such as red light management as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals in the artist services business we compete with companies typically only involved in one or a few of the services we provide some of these competitors include bravado artist arena and global merchandising services 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer stateoftheart venues and strong local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 

 we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving 

of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newlyconstructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol more recently some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of and the type of events we can produce at our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” “ticketmaster” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation ticketmaster house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered many of our trademarks in numerous foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 7900 fulltime employees  including 5400 in north america and 2500 international employees of which approximately 7700 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees primarily for our live music venues as of december 31 2014  we employed approximately 6100 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 15500 seasonal employees in 2014  the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be 

interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage and our common stock if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business and operations 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but such policies may not be sufficient and are subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss in the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including musical artists 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order “order processing” fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist management industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and 

tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season subscription or group sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the ftc and the attorneys general of several individual states and statutory these restrictions include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom  website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our resale ticketing options without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any changes to our current linking practices a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that among other things contain the unique names of venues sports teams or performers or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on any resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the artist management industry is also a highly competitive industry with numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone we compete with these companies and individuals to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists in addition certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist management business are terminable at will by either party leading to competition to retain those artists as clients competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist management business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with our merger with ticketmaster we became subject to both a courtimposed final judgment in the united states and a consent agreement with canadian authorities pursuant to which we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements in addition we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that would be lawful for us to undertake absent the final judgment and the consent agreement our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order and we therefore face certain unquantifiable business risks as a result of compliance 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 

 our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 



our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have recently had labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as 

various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

 our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations is insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we operate a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless the risk remains that one or more of our employees contractors or agents including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result 

in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2014  our international operations accounted for approximately 34  of our revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate operating losses of 62 million 04 million and 53 million for the years ended 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively which had a negative impact on our operating income loss see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions including actions taken to comply with antitrust competition and other regulations that could affect our business and results of operations if we are unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors our business could be adversely impacted 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions in connection with future acquisitions we could take certain actions that could adversely affect our business including 

 in addition acquisitions involve inherent risks which if realized could adversely affect our business and results of operations including those associated with 

 we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust at the state federal and international levels that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed our failure or inability to complete future acquisitions as a result of such laws and regulations or the imposition of unfavorable terms as a condition to the completion of an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

failure to successfully complete the replatforming of our ticketmaster ticketing system in a timely or costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are currently in the process of replatforming our ticketmaster ticketing system and migrating our international brands and businesses to a common ticketing platform in an attempt to provide consistent and stateoftheart services across our businesses and to reduce the cost and expense of maintaining multiple systems which we may not be able to complete in a timely or costeffective manner as with any significant capital project there are numerous factors many of which are beyond 

our control which could influence the ultimate costs and timing of the replatforming project delays or difficulties in making these changes to our ticketing systems as well as any new or enhanced systems may limit our ability to achieve the desired results in a timely manner similarly there can be no assurance that the project once completed will yield the anticipated benefits notwithstanding the current replatforming project we may in the future be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems that may become necessary or desirable if any of the foregoing risks related to the replatforming of our ticketmaster ticketing system were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures system interruption the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information technology systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we lack documentation regarding certain components of our key ticketing software and systems operations and rely on certain key technology personnel to maintain such software and systems the loss of some or all of such personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain such software and systems and could subject us to frequent systems interruptions 

we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in their systems infrastructures or businesses or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair our ability to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism other acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations and the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

due to the internetbased nature of a significant portion of our ticketing and other businesses we process store use and disclose large amounts of data including personal information for our customers any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information and data including credit card information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation and other liabilities network security issues could lead to claims against us for others’ misuse of personal information such as for credit card fraud or identity theft which could result in litigation and financial liabilities as well as administrative action from governmental authorities in addition security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties and impose significant costs related to remediation efforts such as credit or identity theft monitoring or repair costs for impacted customers although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent 

data loss and other security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty it is possible that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries undetected fraud inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data recently large retailers and website operators have been the victims of targeted security breaches resulting in the disclosure andor misappropriation of large amounts of customer data including credit card information we have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any such potential security breaches and their consequences including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment and will be required to continue to do so in the future we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the above concerns related to network and data security the sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other user data are governed by federal state and international laws specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as we expand our operations into new jurisdictions worldwide the costs associated with compliance with these regulations increases it is possible that government or industry regulation in these markets will require us to deviate from our standard deployment mechanisms which will increase operational cost and risk 

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by us our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from trying our products and services andor result in fines andor proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at a reasonable cost including coverage for acts of terrorism and weatherrelated property damage we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2014  we had property and equipment with a net book value of 6953 million  

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with premiums and deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

we have generally registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation while we vigorously protect our trademarks service marks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our businesses have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions we consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or identify inventions and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain accordingly any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology in addition third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams additionally governmental actions such as the recent sanctions by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control and european regulators on certain russian individuals and entities could restrict or limit our business activities in certain areas or subject us to sanction for noncompliance even if inadvertent 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and certain of our subsidiaries and other aspects of our ticketing business we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings including those described in note 7 — commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated financial statements may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following past terrorism actions some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our business the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants of our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

as of december 31 2014  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts of 330 million  and including debt premium of 73 million  was 21 billion  our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 2730 million  with outstanding letters of credit of 620 million  we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2014  475 million  of our total indebtedness excluding interest and unamortized debt discount is due in 2015  1008 million  is due in the aggregate in 2016  and 2017  3468 million  is due in the aggregate in 2018  and 2019  and 16 billion  is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2014  we had 22 billion  in operating lease agreements of which 1358 million  is due in 2015  and 1350 million  is due in 2016  all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2015  see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources is insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

risks relating to our common stock 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors 

under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock

our leases are for varying terms ranging from monthly to multiyear these leases can typically be for terms of three to five years for our office leases and ten to 20 years for our venue leases and many include renewal options there is no significant concentration of venues under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord we believe that an important part of our management activity is to negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions

since the separation and through december 31 2014  we have not declared or paid any dividends we presently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business and to make debt repayments as they become due therefore we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future moreover the terms of our senior secured credit facility limit the amount of funds that we will have available to declare and distribute as dividends on our common stock payment of future cash dividends if any will be at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors including our financial condition operating results current and anticipated cash needs plans for expansion and contractual restrictions with respect to the payment of dividends 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections about our industry business and future financial results our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those discussed under 1a—risk factors and other sections in this annual report 

executive overview 

in 2014 all of our segments reported revenue growth as a result of higher attendance at our north america concerts increased ticket sales globally in our ticketing segment higher artist management commissions and expansion of our sponsorship business this led to our fourth consecutive year of overall revenue growth revenue increased   6  as compared to last year and while all our segments contributed to this success it was largely driven by an increase in the number of stadium concert events in north america along with growth in our primary and resale businesses in ticketing excluding the impact of a goodwill impairment in 2014 operating income and net income for the year both improved as the leading global live event 

and ticketing company we believe that we are wellpositioned to provide the best service to artists teams fans and venues and therefore drive growth across all our businesses we believe that by leveraging our leadership position in the entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience we will sell more tickets which will then grow our sponsorship and advertising revenue 

our concerts segment revenue increased   5  as compared to last year driven by our north america business which had sellout stadium tours as well as increased festival attendance resulting from our expanding portfolio of events the number of fans attending our concert events in north america rose by 6  for the year as a result of creatively packaged tours and festivals crossing all genres of music including rockpop country and electronic dance music due to a reduction of touring content in our international markets we had fewer arena shows and therefore fewer fans attending events internationally which caused global concert attendance to fall by 2 for the year our overall concerts operating results declined to a loss of 1905 million  for the year which includes a 1170 million  charge for a goodwill impairment relating to our international concerts division we will continue to look for expansion opportunities in concerts both domestically and internationally as well as ways to market our events more effectively in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and to sell more tickets 

our ticketing segment revenue increased   11  as compared to last year largely due to growth of our primary and resale businesses in north america our tm resale product continued to perform very strongly delivering significant growth in gross transaction value in each quarter of 2014 as compared to the prior year at the same time we continued to invest in our primary ticketing platform in order to improve the ticket buying experience for our fans and provide better tools and information resources for our venue clients overall the total number of tickets sold increased 3  due to strong concert ticket sales as well as growth in the arts and family categories in our resale business gross transaction value of resale tickets sold increased by 55 to over 900 million for the year due in large part to the success of our new tm product which drove significant growth in concert and professional sports ticket sales throughout the year 18  of our total tickets were sold via mobile and tablet devices up from 14 last year as we continued to implement new features that are driving further expansion of mobile ticket transactions operating margins for the year also improved from 72  in 2013 to 75  in 2014 as we continue to deliver reductions in our cost structure and to grow our resale business 

our artist nation segment revenue increased   10  as compared to last year primarily due to increased artist management commissions new manager and artist relationships resulted in increased revenue from touring recording and other performance fees leading to the yearoveryear growth our artist services business declined due to lower retail merchandise sales and less international touring activity excluding the impact of a goodwill impairment charge of 179 million  relating to our artist services nonmanagement business operating results for the artist nation segment improved significantly in the year due to the increased artist activity along with continued alignment between artist managers and the rest of the live nation organization to deliver more services to these artists our artist nation segment is focused on serving its existing artists as well as developing new relationships with top artists and extending the various services it provides 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue increased  by 5  as compared to last year driven by growth in online sales in north america as well as new sponsorship deals overall operating income is up due to increased revenue as well as improved margins on our sponsorships compared to last year when we had several clients with higher activation program costs our extensive onsite and online reach global venue distribution network artist relationships and ticketing operations are the key to securing longterm sponsorship agreements with major brands and we plan to expand these assets while extending our sales reach further into new markets internationally 

we continue to be optimistic about the longterm potential of our company and are focused on the key elements of our business model expand our concert platform drive conversion of ticket sales through development of innovative products grow sponsorship and advertising sell more tickets and drive reductions in the cost to sell a ticket grow secondary ticket volume and drive artist management through our other core businesses 

segment overview 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing artist nation and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts 

our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world while our concerts segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur from may through september revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year 

to judge the health of our concerts segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events in our network of owned or operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance and advance ticket sales in addition at our 

owned or operated venues we monitor attendance ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods on a constant currency basis 

ticketing 

the ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a convenience charge and order processing fee for these services we sell tickets through websites mobile apps ticket outlets and telephone call centers our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon scheduling by our clients we also offer ticket resale services or secondary ticketing primarily through our integrated inventory platform referred to as tm our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and bundling product offerings through our websites we sell tickets to our own events as well as tickets for our ticketing clients and provide event information revenue related to ticketing service charges is recognized when the ticket is sold except for our own events where we control ticketing and then the revenue is deferred and recognized as the event occurs 

to judge the health of our ticketing segment we primarily review the gross transaction value and the number of tickets sold through our ticketing operations average convenience charges and order processing fees the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services in addition we review the number of visits to our websites the overall number of customers in our database the number of tickets sold via mobile apps and the gross transaction value and fees related to secondary ticket sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods on a constant currency basis 

artist nation

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of adjusted operating income loss to operating income loss 



liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 14 billion  at december 31 2014  and 13 billion  at december 31 2013  included in the december 31 2014  and 2013  cash and cash equivalents balance is 5338 million  and 5384 million  respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of clients and the clients’ share of convenience and order processing charges or client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 4771 million in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2014  we do not intend to repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is ninety days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects current and longterm debt of 21 billion  at december 31 2014  and 18 billion  at december 31 2013  our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the debt discounts and including the debt premium on our term loans and notes was 43  at december 31 2014  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others for ticket sales plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default 

sources of cash 

senior secured credit facility 

at december 31 2014 our senior secured credit facility consisted of i a 115 million  term loan a ii a 950 million  term loan b and iii a 335 million  revolving credit facility in addition subject to certain conditions we have the right to increase the facility by at least 450 million  or a greater amount so long as the senior secured leverage ratio calculated on a proforma basis as defined in the credit agreement is no greater than 325 x the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility with sublimits of up to i 150 million  to be available for the issuance of letters of credit ii 50 million  to be available for swingline loans and iii 150 million  to be available for borrowings in euros or british pounds and iv 50 million  to be available for borrowings in one or more other approved currencies the senior secured credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property and the domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors and by a pledge of substantially all of the shares of stock partnership interests and limited liability company interests of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65  of each class of capital stock of any firsttier foreign subsidiaries

7 senior notes 

in august 2013 we issued an additional 200 million  principal amount of notes under the indenture governing our existing 7  senior notes due 2020 with a 90 million  premium which increased the total principal amount of such notes outstanding to 425 million  interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on march 1 and september 1 of each year and the notes will mature on september 1 2020 we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to september 1 2016 at a price equal to 100  of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption plus a ‘makewhole’ premium using a discount rate equal to the treasury rate plus 50  basis points we may also redeem up to 35  of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to september 1 2015 at a price equal to 107  of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest in addition on or after september 1 2016 we may redeem at our option some or all of the notes at redemption prices that start at 1035  of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption we must make an offer to redeem the notes at 101  of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date if we experience certain defined changes of control 

proceeds from the issuance of the additional 7 senior notes and refinancing of our senior secured credit facility excluding the outstanding principal amounts for lenders who elected to convert their outstanding term loans of 8022 million  were used to repay 4725 million  principal amount of our outstanding borrowings under our then existing senior secured credit facility to repay all of our outstanding 8125 senior notes due 2018 with a principal amount of 250 million  and to pay the related ‘makewhole’ premium on these senior notes and total accrued interest and fees of 353 million  along with related fees and expenses for the refinancing of 220 million  leaving 224 million  in additional cash for general corporate purposes we recorded 363 million  as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to this refinancing in 2013 

5375 senior notes 

in may 2014 we issued 250 million  of 5375  senior notes due 2022 interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june 15 and december 15 beginning december 15 2014 and the notes will mature in june 2022 we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time prior to june 15 2017 at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption plus a ‘makewhole’ premium we may also redeem up to 35 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings prior to june 15 2017 at a price equal to 105375 of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest in addition on or after june 15 2017 we may redeem at our option some or all of the notes at redemption prices that start at 1040313 of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption we must make an offer to redeem the notes at 101 of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date if we experience certain defined changes of control 

25 convertible senior notes 

in may 2014 we issued 275 million  of convertible senior notes due 2019 the notes pay interest semiannually in arrears on may 15 and november 15 at a rate of 25 per annum beginning on november 15 2014 the notes will mature in may 2019 and may not be redeemed by us prior to the maturity date the notes will be convertible under certain circumstances until november 15 2018 and on or after such date without condition at an initial conversion rate of 288363  shares of our common stock per 1000  principal amount of notes subject to adjustment which represents a 525 conversion premium based on the last reported sale price for our common stock of 2274  on may 19 2014 upon conversion the notes may be settled in shares of common stock or at our election cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock assuming we fully settled the notes in shares the maximum number of shares that could be issued to satisfy the conversion is currently 79 million 

if we experience a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes the holders of the 25 convertible senior notes may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes subject to specified exceptions at a price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest if any 

extinguishment of debt 

in july 2014 the holders of 293 million  in aggregate outstanding principal of the 2875  convertible senior notes exercised their right to redeem their notes for cash and in late september 2014 pursuant to our option under the indenture governing the notes we redeemed the remaining outstanding notes using the net proceeds from the issuances of our 5375 senior notes and our 25 convertible senior notes in addition to redeeming the principal amount of 220 million  of the notes we paid total accrued interest of 11 million  and related fees and expenses of 02 million  leaving 2939 million  in additional cash available for general corporate purposes the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 related to the redemption of the 2875 convertible senior notes was not significant 

debt covenants 

our amended senior secured credit facility contains a number of covenants and restrictions that among other things requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants and restricts our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt make certain investments and acquisitions repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness create liens enter into agreements with affiliates modify the nature of our business enter into saleleaseback transactions transfer and sell material assets merge or consolidate and pay dividends and make distributions with the exception of subsidiary dividends or distributions to the parent company or other subsidiaries on at least a prorata basis with any noncontrolling interest partners noncompliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable the amended senior secured credit facility agreement has one covenant measured quarterly that relates to total leverage the consolidated total leverage covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total funded debt to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the amended credit agreement of 50 x over the trailing four  consecutive quarters through september 30 2015 the consolidated total leverage ratio will reduce to 475 x on december 31 2015 and 450 x on december 31 2016 

the indentures governing our 7 senior notes and 5375 senior notes contain covenants that limit among other things our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments sell certain assets agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us merge consolidate or sell all of our assets create certain liens and engage in transactions with affiliates on terms that are not armslength certain covenants including those pertaining to incurrence of indebtedness restricted payments asset sales mergers and transactions with affiliates will be suspended during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both rating agencies and no default or event of default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing the 7 senior notes and the 5375 senior notes contain two  incurrencebased financial covenants as defined requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 x and a maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio of 325 x for the 7 senior notes and 35x for the 5375 senior notes 

some of our other subsidiary indebtedness includes restrictions on entering into various transactions such as acquisitions and disposals and prohibits payment of ordinary dividends they also have financial covenants including minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest payable minimum consolidated cash flow to consolidated debt service and maximum consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda all as defined in the applicable debt agreements 

as of december 31 2014  we believe we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants we expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants throughout 2015  

disposals of assets 

during 2013  we received 826 million of proceeds primarily related to the sale of a theater in new york and insurance recoveries for storm damage sustained to an amphitheater located in new york there were no significant disposals of operating assets in 2014 and 2012 

stock option exercises 

during 2014 and 2013 we received 218 million  and 851 million  respectively of proceeds from the exercise of stock options there were no significant stock option exercises during 2012 

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash on its balance sheet at the time of acquisition all amounts discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2014  we used 2102 million  of cash primarily for acquisitions of a controlling interest in a festival and concert promoter located in the united states in our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments and three acquisitions of artist management businesses located in the united states in our artist nation segment 

during 2013  we used 935 million  of cash primarily for acquisitions of controlling interests in festival promoters located in the united states and the united kingdom both in our concerts segment along with the acquisition in our artist nation segment of an artist management business located in the united kingdom 

during 2012 we used 756 million  of cash primarily for acquisitions in our concerts segment of a controlling interest in a concert promoter located in australia and two festival promoters located in the united states and the united kingdom 

intangibles 

during 2012 we used 146 million of cash primarily related to the purchase of rights to a festival in europe there was no significant use of cash to purchase intangible assets during 2014 and 2013 

purchases of noncontrolling interests 

during 2013 we used 509 million of cash primarily for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in a company that owns the 3arena in ireland there were no significant acquisitions of noncontrolling interests during 2014 and 2012 

deferred and contingent consideration 

we used 106 million  of cash to settle deferred and contingent consideration liabilities for certain past acquisitions during 2012  there were no significant payments during 2014  and 2013 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new online or ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance companies consisted of the following 



revenue generating capital expenditures for 2014  increased from the prior year primarily due to an increase in venuerelated projects and higher investments in technology and development of innovative new products 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2013  decreased from the prior year primarily due to reduced expenditures related to the replatforming of our ticketing system and other ticketing products 

for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 44 million  247 million  and 12 million  respectively of insurance proceeds and landlord reimbursements have been excluded from capital expenditures in the table above included in this total for 2013 is 185 million of insurance proceeds excluded from revenue generating capital expenditures to restore an amphitheater in new york that sustained storm damage 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 145 million for the year ending december 31 2015  

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and premium future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2014  are as follows 



1      on or after november 2018 holders may convert their 25 convertible senior notes 

2 does not include interest on the revolving credit facility as the balance was zero as of december 31 2014  

3      commitment amounts for noncancelable operating leases and noncancelable contracts which stipulate an increase in the commitment amount based on an inflationary index have been estimated using an inflation factor of 24  for north america 33  for the united kingdom and 18  for the netherlands 

 

during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 200 million  through the end of 2035  which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2015  through 2019  are 16 million  each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business in 2008 the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2014  

aggregate minimum rentals of 705 million  to be received in years 2015  through 2023  under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 131 million  in each respective year primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended 2014  compared to year ended 2013   

cash provided by operating activities was 2694 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 4175 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the 1481 million  decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing of ticket sales along with the size and number of future events during 2014 this change was primarily due to an increase in prepaid eventrelated expenses driven by the timing of artist advances partially offsetting this use of operating cash was an increase in the cash portion of net income driven by growth in operating results in 2014 

year ended 2013 compared to year ended 2012 

cash provided by operating activities was 4175 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 3671 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the 504 million increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in the cashrelated portion of net income driven by our improved operating results in 2013 in addition we had higher collections of accounts receivable and also benefited from increases in accrued expenses in 2013 as compared to the prior year 

investing activities 

year ended 2014  compared to year ended 2013   

cash used in investing activities was 3843 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 1437 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  the 2406 million  increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher payments for acquisitions and lower proceeds received from the disposal of operating assets as compared to the prior year see “—sources of cash” and “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

year ended 2013 compared to year ended 2012 

cash used in investing activities was 1437 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2038 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the 601 million decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher proceeds received from the disposal of operating assets in 2013 as compared to the prior year see “—sources of cash” above for further discussion 

financing activities 

year ended 2014  compared to year ended 2013 

cash provided by financing activities was 2409 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 330 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  t he 2079 million  increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily a result of higher net proceeds from the issuance of the 5375 senior notes and 25 convertible senior notes after repayment of the 2875 convertible senior notes and lower payments for purchases of noncontrolling interests partially offset by lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options in 2014 as compared to the prior year 

year ended 2013 compared to year ended 2012 

cash provided by financing activities was 330 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to cash used in financing activities of 199 million for the year ended december 31 2012 t he 529 million increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily a result of higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by higher purchases of noncontrolling interests in 2013 as compared to the prior year 

seasonality 

our concerts artist nation and sponsorship  advertising segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur during may through september and our artist touring activity is higher in addition the timing of the onsale of tickets and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for global tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a — risk factorsour operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries excluding the goodwill impairment our foreign operations reported operating income of 859 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2014  by 86 million  as of december 31 2014  our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar   this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2014  we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of 633 million  

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 21 billion  of total debt net of unamortized discounts and premium outstanding as of december 31 2014  of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 10 billion of fixedrate debt and 11 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2014  each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 26 million when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2014  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

at december 31 2014  we have an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes the interest rate swap had a notional amount of 68 million at december 31 2014  to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis and expires in may 2015 the fair value of this agreement at december 31 2014  was not significant this agreement was put into place to reduce the variability of the cash flows from the interest payments related to certain financing 

we have two interest rate swap agreements with a 225 million aggregate notional amount at december 31 2014  that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis both agreements expire in december 2015 these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently issued pronouncements 

in april 2014 the fasb issued guidance that raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation the guidance is effective for disposals or classifications as held for sale of components of an entity that occur   within annual periods beginning on or after december 15 2014 and interim periods within that year th is guidance is applied prospectively and early adoption is permit ted we will adopt this guidance on january 1 2015 and will apply it prospectively to disposals occurring on or after january 1 2015 

in may 2014 the fasb issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap the new standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 and early adoption of the standard is not permitted the guidance should be applied retrospectively either to each prior period presented in the financial statements or only to the most current reporting period presented in the financial statements with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption we will adopt this standard on january 1 2017 and are currently assessing which implementation method we will apply and the impact its adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 

in june 2014 the fasb issued guidance that requires a performance target in a sharebased payment that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be accounted for as a performance condition the guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 and interim periods within that year and early adoption is permitted the guidance should be applied on a prospective basis to awards that are granted or modified on or after the effective date the guidance may be applied on a modified retrospective basis for performance targets outstanding on or after the beginning of the first annual period presented as of the date of adoption we do not currently expect to grant these type of awards but will adopt this guidance on january 1 2016 and will apply it prospectively to any awards granted on or after january 1 2016 that include these terms 

in february 2015 the fasb issued new guidance for evaluating whether a reporting organization should consolidate certain legal entities this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 and early adoption is permitted the guidance should be applied either using a modified retrospective approach or retrospectively we will adopt this standard on january 1 2016 and we are currently assessing which implementation method we will apply and the impact its adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and 

liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions where applicable 

consolidation 

we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount when specific assets are determined to be impaired the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as other fair value measures for intangibles related to 

artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we currently have seven reporting units with goodwill balances international concerts and north american concerts within the concerts segment artist management and artist services nonmanagement within the artist nation segment international ticketing and north american ticketing within the ticketing segment and sponsorship  advertising 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a threestep process we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our operating segments or reporting units 

the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include historical financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired or if that conclusion cannot be determined qualitatively a second step is performed for that reporting unit regardless all reporting units undergo a second step at least once every five years this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the third step employed for any reporting unit that fails the second step is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative we do not follow this three step process in this case a qualitative evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired if it is the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill described above is performed in all three steps discount rates market multiples and sensitivity tests are derived andor computed with the assistance of external valuation consultants 

the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination thereof the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to those companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on both quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium a control premium represents the additional value an investor would pay in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit it is important to note that items such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation expense are not part of cash flows which is more akin to our adjusted operating income metric the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our estimates of future financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate the attrition rate and expected future revenue which vary among reporting units 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

we perform sensitivity analyses when the most likely result is unclear in the first step and for both the second and third steps in our process generally we test for sensitivities to discount rate revenue growth market multiples and customer attrition which are the most significant assumptions we did not identify any reporting units with sensitivity test results that would change our first step conclusions the reporting units that did not advance to the second step each had a significant excess of fair value over their carrying value in the most recent quantitative tests outperformed their recent financial expectations andor had improvement in their discount rates and market multiples although we cannot predict future 

performance or market conditions we do not currently believe that any of these reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

the north american concerts and artist management reporting units did advance to the second step but did not advance to the third step and their excess of fair value over carrying value ranged from 22 to 37 both of these reporting units had outperformed their recent financial expectations and had improvement in their discount rates north american concerts had improvement in its market multiple whereas artist management had a slight decline sensitivity tests on north american concerts showed that a 300 basis point change in the discount rate was needed to change the conclusion it was not sensitive to revenue growth rate market multiple or control premium changes artist management showed a 150 basis point change in the discount rate or a 40 decline in the revenue growth rate was needed to change the conclusion it was not sensitive to market multiple or control premium changes given the amount of excess fair value over carrying value and the results of the sensitivity tests performed although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe these two reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

both the international concerts and artist services nonmanagement reporting units recorded goodwill impairments in the fourth quarter of 2014 both of these reporting units did not meet their financial expectations in the current year and for artist services the market multiple decreased slightly offsetting these changes were improved discount rates for both reporting units and an increase in the market multiple for international concerts although both reporting units failed the second step by only 6 or less and showed some sensitivity to the discount rate revenue growth and market multiples such that it would not take a large change in some of these assumptions to pass the second step it was concluded that they should advance to the third step sensitivities were performed for the third step however those assumptions tested needed more than a minor improvement to change the conclusion of impairment after taking into consideration the impairment recorded in 2014 although we cannot predict future performance or market conditions we do not currently believe these two reporting units are at risk of failing the second step in the near future 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the show occurs revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the show occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned or operated venues in the united states and where we control the tickets internationally revenue is recognized after the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs these service charges will be shared between our ticketing and concerts segments for tickets sold for events at thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as almost all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations the amount of earnings at december 31 2014  that is permanently reinvested was approximately 11 billion  it is not practical to determine the amount of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 



 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discounts premium and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues

on january 25 2010 we merged with ticketmaster effective on the date of the merger ticketmaster became a whollyowned subsidiary of live nation and live nation inc changed its name to live nation entertainment inc 

our industry 

we operate in five main industries within the live entertainment business including live music events venue operations ticketing services sponsorship and advertising sales and artist management and services 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents directly contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with artists to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from artists for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours two to nine months typically elapse between initially booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and equipment 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise venue sponsorships parking and premium seating 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone mobile devices outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee on these box office tickets the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is 

sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting their fee as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

ticketing resale services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue promoter or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue promoter or other entity resale tickets are also referred to as secondary tickets generally the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

artist managers primarily provide services to music recording artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings artist services sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet as well as connect artists to corporate clients for events and generally are paid a percentage of the artist’s earnings 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies to advertise or promote their brand or product the advertising campaigns typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online banner advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage hotel and telecommunications these promotional programs may include event presales and onsite product activation 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing artist nation and sponsorship  advertising 

concerts our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned or operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world during 2013  our concerts business generated approximately 45 billion  or 697  of our total revenue we promoted 22900  live music events in 2013  including artists such as pnk jayz jason aldean maroon 5 beyonce rihanna and one direction and through festivals such as rock werchter electric daisy carnival reading and download while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur may through september 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

as a festival operator we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also arrange for thirdparties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally impacted by the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue since the artist fees are typically fixed guarantees for these events significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a fixed fee or a percentage of the total convenience charge and order processing fee for its services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through websites telephone mobile apps and ticket outlets during the year ended december 31 2013  we sold 71 5 14  and 10 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and bundled product offerings during 2013  our ticketing business generated approximately 14 billion  or 217  of our total revenue which excludes the face value of tickets sold through all of our ticketing services we sold 149 million  tickets in 2013  on 

which we were paid fees for our services in addition approximately 250 million  tickets in total were sold using our ticketmaster systems through season seat packages and our venue clients’ box offices for which we do not receive a fee our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients 

we sell tickets on behalf of our clients through our ticketing platforms across the world in order to provide stateoftheart ticketing technology services we are currently in the process of replatforming portions of our ticketmaster ticketing system which we believe will result in an improved experience for our fans and better tools and information resources for our venue clients we started this replatforming for our north america business in 2011 and currently expect to start using the new technology at certain of our venue clients in 2015 in addition to providing improved technology products we believe that once this replatforming is complete and rolled out to our clients that it will allow us to also improve the efficiency of our ticketing systems and processes and therefore lead to cost reductions in ticketing 

we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket price will be agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider where we have exclusive contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute group sales and season tickets inhouse in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and does not make those tickets available for sale by us we also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs or other similar arrangements from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales as a result we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any single client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services through our integrated inventory platform referred to as tm ticketsnow in the united states and canada our ticketexchange service in the united states europe and canada and get me in in the united kingdom we enter into listing agreements with ticket resellers to post ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a ticket resale price determined by the ticket reseller plus an amount equal to a percentage of the ticket resale price and a predetermined service fee we remit the ticket resale price to the ticket resellers and retain the remainder of the purchase price while we do not generally acquire tickets for sale on our own behalf we may do so from time to time on a limited basis in addition to enabling premium primary ticket sales the ticketexchange service allows consumers to resell and purchase tickets online for certain events for our venue clients who elect to participate in the ticketexchange service sellers and buyers each pay a fee that has been negotiated with the relevant client a portion of which is shared with the client 

artist nation  our artist nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists our artist nation segment also sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet during 2013  our artist nation business generated approximately 353 million  or 54  of our total revenue revenue earned from our artist nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent and generally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from may through september tends to be a popular time for touring events 

sponsorship  advertising our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through our concert venue artist relationship and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connects their brands directly with fans and artists we also develop book and produce custom events or programs for our client’s specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the client’s consumers these custom events can involve live music events with talent and media using both online and traditional outlets during 2013  our sponsorship  advertising business generated approximately 285 million  or 44  of our total revenue we typically experience higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used in or occur during may through september 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for 

advertisers our sponsorship programs include companies such as starwood american express carlsberg o 2  anheuserbusch citi and cocacola each of the preceding brands is a registered trademark of the sponsor our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories

at december 31 2013  we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in the following domestic and international venues primarily used for music events 

















  

 

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had exclusive booking rights for or had an equity interest in as of december 31 2013  



competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or financial marketing support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from both promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

our main competitors in the live music industry include anschutz entertainment group or aeg and c3 presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe aeg operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west goldenvoice and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg aeg the nederlander organization and the bowery presents in addition to 

numerous smaller regional companies in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through telephone mobile devices and ticket outlets as online and mobile ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts has created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby brokers are using bot technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan inc veritix and cts eventim ag online and event companies such as eventbrite etix and ticketfly and secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

in the artist management business we compete with other artist managers both at larger talent representation companies such as red light management as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals in the artist services business we compete with companies typically only involved in one or a few of the services we provide some of these competitors include bravado artist arena and global merchandising services 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages as well as festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 

 we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries we operate in and also the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol more recently some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” “ticketmaster” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation ticketmaster house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered many of our trademarks in numerous foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 7400 fulltime employees  including 4900 in north america and 2500 international employees of which approximately 7200 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees primarily for our live music venues as of december 31 2013  we employed approximately 5500 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 13000 seasonal employees in 2013  the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could 

have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business and operations our leverage our common stock ticketmaster’s spinoff from iac and our merger with ticketmaster these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business and operations 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams our artist management business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours two to nine months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but it may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist management business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss in the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including musical artists 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order “order processing” fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist management industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and 

tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season subscription or group sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline as we are also a content provider and venue operator we may face direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the ftc and the attorneys general of several individual states and statutory these restrictions primarily relate to our ticketsnow business and include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom  website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our ticketsnow resale website without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any changes to our current ticketmasterticketsnow linking practices a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that among other things contain the unique names of venues sports teams or performers or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on the ticketsnow website or any other resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market through our ticketsnow business or otherwise may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the artist management industry is also a highly competitive industry there are numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone we compete with these companies and individuals to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists in addition certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist management business are terminable at will by either party leading to competition to retain those artists as clients competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist management business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 

 we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results have been adversely affected by among other things variability in ticket sales event profitability overhead costs and high amortization of intangibles related to prior acquisitions we incurred net losses of 360 million  1619 million  and 704 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively we may face reduced demand for our live music events our ticketing software and services and other factors that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will maintain profitability in future periods 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 



our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and economic and other factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during periods of economic slowdown and recession many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have recently had labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we operate in international markets which subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial accounting regulatory political and economic risks and conditions specific to such markets which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

 our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations are insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

in foreign countries in which we have operations a risk exists that our employees contractors or agents could in contravention of our policies engage in business practices prohibited by applicable united states laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act as well as the laws and regulations of other countries prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials such as the united kingdom bribery act 2010 we maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anticorruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations nevertheless we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our employees contractors or agents 

including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such united states laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies circumvent our compliance programs and by doing so violate such laws and regulations any such violations even if prohibited by our internal policies could result in fines criminal sanctions against us andor our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2013  our international operations accounted for approximately 39  of our revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate net losses of 25 million and 13 million in 2012  and 2011  respectively which increased our net loss we experienced a foreign exchange rate net gain of 27 million in 2013 see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect our results of operations and the price of our common stock 

as part of our growth strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could among other things 

 such actions by us could adversely affect our results of operations and the price of our common stock 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions acquisitions involve risks including those associated with 

 we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things expenses to pursue the acquisition and the incurrence of debt in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets that currently exist or will be acquired in the future could be impacted by one or more unfavorable events or trends which could result in impairment charges the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results 

of operations in addition we may choose to substantially reduce or discontinue the operations of any of our acquired businesses if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges any such shutdown could expose us to expenses associated with exiting from existing contracts and terminating employees and could expose us to certain unknown liabilities that arise following the shutdown 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the doj with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in other jurisdictions also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

our businesses may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards 

the ticketing industry is characterized by evolving industry standards frequent new service and product introductions enhancements and changing customer demands we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements and preferences and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the continued widespread adoption of new internet or telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our respective services or infrastructures our failure to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures in response to these trends could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to successfully complete the replatforming of our ticketmaster ticketing system in a timely or costeffective manner could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are currently in the process of replatforming our ticketmaster ticketing system and migrating our international brands and businesses to a common ticketing platform in an attempt to provide consistent and stateoftheart services across our businesses and to reduce the cost and expense of maintaining multiple systems which we may not be able to complete in a timely or costeffective manner as with any significant capital project there are numerous factors many of which are beyond our control which could influence the ultimate costs and timing of the replatforming project for a discussion of these factors see the risk factor related to costs associated with capital improvements below delays or difficulties in making these changes to our ticketing systems as well as any new or enhanced systems may limit our ability to achieve the desired results in a timely mann er similarly there can be no assurance that the project once completed will yield the anticipated benefits notwithstanding the current replatforming project  we may in the future be unable to devote financial resources to new techn ologies and systems that may become necessary or desirable if any of the foregoing risks related to the replatforming of our ticketmaster ticketing system were to occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and the protection of the data contained in such systems system interruption the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures and breaches or lapses in the security protecting these systems may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information technology systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we lack documentation regarding certain components of our key ticketing software and systems operations and rely on certain key technology personnel to maintain such software and systems the loss of some or all of such personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain such software and systems and could subject us to frequent systems interruptions we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in their systems and infrastructures their businesses andor third parties or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair our ability to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism other acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information and data could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation and other liabilities network security issues could lead to claims against us for other misuse of personal information such as for unauthorized purposes or identity theft which could result in litigation and financial liabilities as well as administrative action from governmental authorities in addition security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties it is possible that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries undetected fraud inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data as a result current security measures may not prevent any or all security breaches recently large retailers and website operators have been the victims of targeted security breaches resulting in the disclosure of large amounts of customer data including credit card information we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

in the processing of consumer transactions we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by our respective privacy and data security policies moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storage sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by us our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from trying our products and services andor result in fines andor 

proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at a reasonable cost including coverage for acts of terrorism and weatherrelated property damage we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2013  we had property and equipment with a net book value of 7068 million  

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at a reasonable cost to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at a reasonable cost or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues and our technology therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand improve value and grow revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements including 

 the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsuses of cash 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

we have generally registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation while we vigorously protect our trademarks service marks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our businesses have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions we consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or identify inventions and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain accordingly any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology in addition third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol additionally new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we and our ticketsnow business are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and ticketsnow and other aspects of our ticketing business we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings including those described in note 7 — commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated financial statements may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business potential union pension obligations could cause us to incur unplanned liabilities 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we participate in and make recurrent contributions to various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our current and former union employees our required recurrent contributions to these plans could unexpectedly increase during the 

term of a collective bargaining agreement due to erisa laws that require additional contributions to be made when a pension fund enters into critical status which may occur for reasons that are beyond our control in addition we may be required by law to fulfill our pension withdrawal liability with respect to any multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw our potential withdrawal liability will increase if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities any unplanned multiemployer pension liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our revenue depends in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional branding and other marketing campaigns for our live music events the live nation ticketmaster wwwticketmastercom   wwwlivenationcom and other brand names and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of events and ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related merchandise and apparel and costs related to search engine optimization and paid search engine marketing for our ecommerce sites during 2013  we spent approximately 39  of our revenue on marketing including advertising there can be no assurance that these marketing or advertising efforts will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following past terrorism actions some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our business the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

as of december 31 2013  our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts of 240 million  and including debt premium of 86 million  was 18 billion  our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was 2669 million  with outstanding letters of credit of 681 million  we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2013  2860 million  of our total indebtedness excluding interest and unamortized debt discount is due in 2014  953 million  is due in the aggregate for 2015  and 2016  1013 million  is due in the aggregate for 2017  and 2018  and 13 billion  is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2013  we had 23 billion  in operating lease agreements of which 1194 million  is due in 2014  and 1236 million  is due in 2015  all longterm debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected here as due in 2014 see the table in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscontractual obligations and commitmentsfirm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs furthermore they may restrict our ability to expand to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations there under accelerated our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose our foreign subsidiaries generate a portion of our operating cash flows although we do not intend to repatriate these funds from our foreign subsidiaries in order to satisfy payment requirements in the united states we would be required to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits these taxes could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses could result in the loss of key tours or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to advance cash or post a letter of credit to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour additionally to secure new or retain existing ticketing clients we are often required by the client to make cash advances at the beginning andor periodically during the term of the 

agreement if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our senior secured credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted similarly if we did not have enough cash on hand or access to cash required to advance to new ticketing clients or to continue to pay advances under existing ticketing agreements our ticketing business would be negatively impacted 

risks relating to our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

our stock price has fluctuated between 714 and 1994 over the past three fiscal years the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay deter or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents and to remove directors as well as limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the 

acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline as of december 31 2013  there were 1996 million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including 22 million  shares of unvested restricted stock awards and excluding 04 million shares held in treasury 94 million  shares of common stock issuable from options currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of 1494  per share and 81 million  shares issuable from the conversion of our 2875 convertible notes 

we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of our 2875 convertible notes 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

risks relating to the spinoff from iac 

if the spinoff of ticketmaster from iac or one or more of the spincos were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos iac received a private letter ruling from the united states internal revenue service or irs regarding the qualification of these spinoffs as transactions that are generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos is referred to collectively as the iac spinoffs iac also received an opinion of counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that were not covered by the private letter ruling notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling and opinion of counsel the irs could determine that one or more of the iac spinoffs should be treated as a taxable distribution if it determines that any of the representations statements or assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the irs ruling in addition if any of the representations statements or assumptions upon which the opinion of counsel was based were or become inaccurate the opinion may be invalid 

if any of the iac spinoffs were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes then iac would incur material income tax liabilities for which we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable under applicable federal income tax rules ticketmaster is severally liable for any federal income taxes imposed on iac with respect to taxable periods during which ticketmaster was a member of iac’s consolidated federal income tax return group including the period in which the iac spinoffs were consummated under the tax sharing agreement that ticketmaster entered into with iac and the other spincos ticketmaster generally is required to indemnify iac and the other spincos for any taxes resulting from the spinoff to the extent such amounts resulted from i any act or failure to act by ticketmaster described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement ii any acquisition of equity securities or assets of ticketmaster or iii any breach by ticketmaster of any representation or covenant contained in the spinoff documents or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor tax opinions corresponding indemnification provisions also apply to the other spincos ticketmaster is entitled to indemnification from iac among other things if ticketmaster is liable for or otherwise required to make a payment in respect of a spinoff tax liability for which ticketmaster is not responsible under the tax sharing agreement and if applicable is unable to collect from the spinco responsible for such liability under the tax sharing agreement ticketmaster’s ability to collect under these indemnity provisions would depend on the financial position of the indemnifying party 

certain transactions in iac ticketmaster or other spinco equity securities could cause one or more of the iac spinoffs to be taxable to iac and may give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

current united states federal income tax law creates a presumption that any of the iac spinoffs would be taxable to iac if it is part of a “plan or series of related transactions” pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in iac or a spinco including ticketmaster acquisitions that occur during the fouryear period that begins two years before the date of a spinoff are presumed to occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions unless it is established that the acquisition is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions that includes the spinoff 

these rules limited ticketmaster’s ability during the twoyear period following the spinoff to enter into certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to us and our stockholders particularly issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs repurchasing equity securities and under certain circumstances acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities or agreeing to be acquired under the tax sharing agreement there were restrictions on ticketmaster’s ability to take such actions for a period of 25 months from the day after the date of the spinoff entering into the merger agreement with live nation did not violate these restrictions because prior to entering into the agreement ticketmaster provided iac with an unqualified opinion of tax counsel contemplated by the tax sharing agreement and iac confirmed that the opinion was satisfactory to iac we believe that we did not take any actions during the twoyear period following the spinoff that compromised the taxfree nature of that transaction however the statutes of limitations related to these tax periods remain open and if taxing authorities successfully assert tax claims against iac related to the spinoff it could give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

in addition to actions of iac and the spincos including ticketmaster certain transactions that are outside their control and therefore not subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the tax sharing agreement such as a sale or disposition of the stock of iac or the stock of a spinco by certain persons that own five percent or more of any class of stock of iac or a spinco could have a similar effect on the taxfree status of a spinoff as transactions to which iac or a spinco is a party 

as a result of these rules even if each iac spinoff otherwise qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes transactions involving spinco or iac equity securities including transactions by certain significant stockholders could cause iac to recognize taxable gain with respect to the stock of the spinco as described above although the restrictive covenants and indemnification provisions contained in the tax sharing agreement are intended to minimize the likelihood that such an event will occur one or more of the iac spinoffs may become taxable to iac as a result of transactions in iac or spinco equity securities as discussed previously we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable for such taxes under the tax sharing agreement or under applicable federal income tax rules 

in connection with the merger ticketmaster received i two unqualified opinions of tax counsel one dated as of the date of execution of the definitive merger agreement and one dated as of the closing date of the merger that the transaction as contemplated in the definitive merger agreement would not have an adverse tax effect on the spinoff and ii iac’s written acknowledgement that the closing date opinion was in form and substance satisfactory to iac however the irs may disagree with the conclusions in these opinions of counsel and determine that the merger caused the spinoff to be taxable to iac were this to occur and that position were sustained we as successorininterest to ticketmaster would be required to make material indemnification payments to iac 

risks relating to the merger 

in connection with the merger we became subject to a courtimposed final judgment placing certain restrictions and obligations on us which could negatively impact our business 

in connection with the merger we became subject through july 2020 to a courtimposed final judgment or the final judgment that places certain restrictions and obligations on us in order to address the issues the doj raised in its antitrust review of the merger pursuant to the final judgment we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the final judgment 

during the duration of the final judgment we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order our compliance with the final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

in connection with the merger we also entered into a consent agreement with the canadian competition commission or the canadian consent agreement which has the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the final judgment on our business in canada the canadian consent agreement will remain in effect through july 2020 the canadian consent agreement creates similar risks for us both in terms of creating potential enforcement actions and in limiting us from pursuing certain business practices

executive overview 

in 2013 we continued to deliver growth in revenue ticket sales number of fans attending our concerts and operating results our revenue increased   11  compared to 2012 driven by an increase in our concerts segment’s event activity as well as higher sales in our sponsorship  advertising segment the ticketing segment revenue was also up for the year despite the revenue received in 2012 related to the london olympics driven by strong primary ticket sales in north america for concerts and sporting events as well as higher revenue from our resale business ticket sales for the year grew as a result of our strategy to drive attendance in our concert venues expand our concert portfolio and grow our core ticketing business which resulted in an improvement to our operating results over 2012 we are currently in the process of replatforming our ticketmaster ticketing system in order to provide stateoftheart technology services which will result in an improved experience for our fans and better tools and information resources for our venue clients once it is complete and rolled out to our clients this replatforming will also allow us to improve the efficiency of our ticketing systems and processes and therefore lead to cost reductions in ticketing our strategy remains focused on leveraging our leadership position in the live entertainment industry to reach fans through the live concert experience in order to sell more tickets and grow our sponsorship and advertising revenue 

while continuing to optimize our cost structure we believe that as the leading global live event and ticketing company we are wellpositioned to serve artists teams fans and venues 

our concerts segment delivered a 17  increase in revenue compared to last year through increased amphitheater and arena attendance as well as acquisitions the number of fans was up 19  globally driven by the higher amphitheater activity more events in newer markets like australia as well as the growth in our festival and arena businesses in both north america and europe our overall concerts operating results increased for the year due to improved profitability from this higher activity across the portfolio in addition our concerts operating results were impacted positively by a 248 million gain recognized on the disposal of operating assets related to a theater in new york and a 141 million insurance recovery for storm damage to one of our venues from hurricane sandy we will continue to look for expansion opportunities both domestically and internationally as well as ways to market our events more effectively in order to continue to expand our fan base and geographic reach and to sell more tickets 

our ticketing segment revenue for the year increased   2  compared to last year due to higher ticket sales for concert and sporting events in the united states as well as an increase in our resale business overall the number of tickets sold during the year increased   1  due largely to higher ticket sales domestically tickets sold through our mobile applications nearly doubled as compared to last year as we implemented new features in 2013 that are expected to drive further expansion of mobile ticket transactions globally for the year 14  of our total tickets were sold via mobile devices ticketing operating results for the year were driven by strong domestic ticket sales including those for our owned or operated venues as well as increased activity in our resale business despite the increased revenue and ticket sales our overall operating income was down due to higher costs from investments in our technology platforms and increased amortization of nonrecoupable ticketing advances in 2013 we will continue to invest in a variety of initiatives aimed at improving the ticket buying process and overall fan and venue client experience 

our artist nation segment revenue decreased   12  for the year as compared to last year primarily due to the decision in july of this year by the concerts segment to expand their premium ticket packages and no longer outsource vip ticket sales to artist nation lower amortization in 2013 primarily due to a 627 million impairment of intangibles recognized in 2012 partially offset by higher compensation expenses led to a yearoveryear improvement in operating results for the segment our artist nation segment is focused on serving our existing artists as well as developing new relationships with top artists and extending the various services we provide 

our sponsorship  advertising segment revenue increased   15  over the prior year driven by higher sponsorship revenue generated from festivals and custom events as well as higher online advertising revenue overall operating income improved 10  for the year driven by the higher sales an increase in custom events in north america which have higher direct costs as well as higher fixed costs for sponsorship  advertising led to the slight reduction in operating margins our extensive onsite and online reach global venue distribution network artist relationships and ticketing operations are the key to securing longterm sponsorship agreements with major brands and we continue to expand these assets while extending further into new markets internationally 

overall our net loss for the year was impacted by a loss on extinguishment of debt of 363 million due to the redemption of our 8125 senior notes through the issuance of additional notes under our existing 7 senior notes and the refinancing of and amendment to our senior secured credit facility partially offsetting the loss on extinguishment of debt was a reduction of interest expense for the year resulting from the redemptions of our 1075 senior notes in 2012 and our 8125 senior notes in 2013 through the issuance of 7 senior notes in both years 

 we continue to be optimistic about the longterm potential of our company and are focused on the key elements of our business model  expand our concert platform drive conversion of ticket sales through social and mobile channels grow our sponsorship and online revenue sell more tickets for our ticketmaster clients both primary and secondary while driving reductions in the ticketing cost structure and continue to align our artist management group with our other core businesses

the decreased operating loss for artist nation for the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily driven by the lower amortization expense

artist nation revenue increased 68 million or 2 during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year primarily due to increased sales of vip tickets and incremental revenue of 95 million resulting from the acquisition of a merchandising company located in australia in october 2011 these increases were partially offset by reduced tour merchandise sales and the transition of the online fan club activity to the ticketing segment in 2011

artist nation selling general and administrative expenses decreased 134 million or 12 during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year primarily due to 244 million of stockbased compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of 2011 related to the acquisition of certain of the remaining interests in front line partially offset by incremental costs of 55 million related to the departure of a former executive 19 million resulting from the acquisition above and higher compensationrelated costs related to the management business 

artist nation depreciation and amortization increased 653 million during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an impairment charge of 627 million related to certain clientvendor relationship intangibles in the management business based on current expectations related to future cash flows on this business

reconciliation of segment adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration arrangements payments under the trust note and acquisitionrelated severance depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment loss gain on disposal of operating assets and noncash and certain stockbased compensation expense including expense associated with grants of certain stockbased awards which were classified as liabilities   we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table sets forth the reconciliation of adjusted operating income loss to operating income loss 



liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings we may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 13 billion  at december 31 2013  and 10 billion  at december 31 2012  included in the december 31 2013  and 2012  cash and cash equivalents balance is 5384 million  and 4416 million  respectively of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of clients and the clients’ share of convenience and order processing charges or client cash we generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 4755 million in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash at december 31 2013  we do not intend to repatriate these funds but if we did we would need to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is ninety days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheet reflects current and longterm debt of 18 billion  at december 31 2013  and 17 billion  at december 31 2012  our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the debt discounts and including the debt premium on our term loans and notes was 43  at december 31 2013  

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned or operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client cash less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others for ticket sales plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions we expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default 

sources of cash

proceeds from the issuance of the additional 7 senior notes and refinancing of our senior secured credit facility excluding the outstanding principal amounts for lenders who elected to convert their outstanding term loans of 8022 million  were used to repay 4725 million  principal amount of our outstanding borrowings under our then existing senior secured credit facility to repay all of our outstanding 8125 senior notes due 2018 with a principal amount of 250 million  and to pay the related ‘makewhole’ premium on these senior notes and total accrued interest and fees of 353 million  along with related fees and expenses for the refinancing of 220 million  leaving 224 million  in additional cash for general corporate purposes we recorded 363 million  as a loss on extinguishment of debt related to this refinancing

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network the development of new online or ticketing tools and technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance companies consisted of the following 



maintenance capital expenditures for 2013  decreased from the prior year primarily due to a reduction in venuerelated projects 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2013  decreased from the prior year primarily due to the timing of expenditures related to the replatforming of our ticketing system and other ticketing products excluded from revenue generating capital expenditures in 2013 is the use of 185 million of insurance proceeds to restore an amphitheater in new york that sustained storm damage 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2012  decreased from the prior year primarily due to a reduction in venuerelated projects and office renovations 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2012  increased from the prior year primarily related to our investment in technology and renovation and development of various venues 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 130 million for the year ending december 31 2014  

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases 

some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and client ticketing agreements as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt excluding unamortized debt discounts and premium future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts capital expenditure commitments and expected payments of contingent consideration liabilities as of december 31 2013  are as follows 



 

 during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 215 million  through the end of 2035  which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2014  through 2018  are 16 million  each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business in 2008 the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2013  

aggregate minimum rentals of 857 million  to be received in years 2014  through 2023  under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 131 million  and 127 million  respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards and obligations under a venue management agreement 

cash flows 

operating activities 

year ended 2013  compared to year ended 2012   

cash provided by operating activities was 4175 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 3671 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the 504 million  increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in the cashrelated portion of net income driven by our improved operating results this year in addition we had higher collections of accounts receivable and also benefited from increases in accrued expenses in 2013 as compared to the prior year 

year ended 2012  compared to year ended 2011 

cash provided by operating activities was 3671 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 1357 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 2314 million increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing of ticket sales along with the size and number of events for upcoming periods during 2012 we sold more tickets for future events than we did in 2011 which increased deferred revenue partially offset by higher payments of prepaid eventrelated expenses for those future events in addition we collected more accounts receivable had lower longterm artistrelated payments and paid less accrued eventrelated expenses in 2012 as compared to the prior year also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities was 222 million in payments made in 2011 related to the acquisition of certain remaining equity interests in front line that were classified as liabilities 

investing activities 

year ended 2013  compared to year ended 2012   

cash used in investing activities was 1437 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to 2038 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  the 601 million  decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher proceeds received from the disposal of operating assets in 2013 as compared to the prior year see “—sources of cash” and “—uses of cash ” above for further discussion 

year ended 2012  compared to year ended 2011 

cash used in investing activities was 2038 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 1520 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 518 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher payments for acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets along with purchases of property plant and equipment primarily related to technology in 2012 as compared to the prior year 

financing activities 

year ended 2013  compared to year ended 2012 

cash provided by financing activities was 330 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  compared to cash used in financing activities of 199 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  t he 529 million  increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily a result of higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by higher purchases of noncontrolling interests in 2013 as compared to the prior year 

year ended 2012  compared to year ended 2011 

cash used in financing activities was 199 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 444 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 245 million decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily a result of net proceeds received in 2012 from the issuance of the 7 senior notes and increased term loan b borrowings after repayment of the 1075 senior notes and related costs along with additional financing to fund australian operations as compared to a net pay down in 2011 on the term loans we also made lower payments of deferred and contingent consideration in 2012 as compared to 2011 also contributing to the decrease was cash used in 2011 for purchases of noncontrolling interests for certain of the remaining equity interests in front line these decreases in cash used were partially offset by proceeds received in 2011 from the sale of common stock in connection with the subscription agreement with liberty media 

seasonality 

our concerts artist nation and sponsorship  advertising segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and festivals are primarily used in or occur during may through september and our artist touring activity is higher in addition the timing of the onsale of tickets and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs for global tours in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales at our owned or operated venues in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a — risk factorsour operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 1226 million for the year ended december 31 2013  we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2013  by 123 million as of december 31 2013  our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound australian dollar and canadian dollar   this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also may enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2013  we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of 960 million  

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 18 billion  of total debt net of unamortized discounts and premium outstanding as of december 31 2013  of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 7429 million of fixedrate debt and 11 billion of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2013  each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 27 million when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2013  with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

at december 31 2013  we have an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes the interest rate swap had a notional amount of 104 million at december 31 2013  to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis and expires in may 2015 the fair value of this agreement at december 31 2013  was a liability of 01 million this agreement was put into place to reduce the variability of the cash flows from the interest payments related to certain financing 

we have two interest rate swap agreements with a 289 million aggregate notional amount at december 31 2013  that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis both agreements expire in december 2015 these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

we currently have 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 with a principal amount of 220 million beginning with the period commencing on july 20 2014 and ending on january 14 2015 and for each of the interest periods commencing thereafter we will pay contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120 of the principal amount of the notes the contingent interest payable per note will equal 025 per year of the average trading price of such note during the applicable five tradingday reference period payable in arrears 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted pronouncements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued guidance which requires companies to disclose additional information about reclassifications out of aoci including changes in aoci balances by component and significant items reclassified out of aoci the new disclosure requirements are applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2012 we adopted this guidance on january 1 2013 

in july 2013 the fasb issued guidance that requires a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit to be offset against a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if certain criteria are met the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 and are applied prospectively to unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date early adoption and retrospective application of the new guidance are permitted this guidance is consistent with our present practice and will not have a material impact on our financial position 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

consolidation 

we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also vies for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability 

goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

the company tests for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

the company tests for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of or projected operating cash flow losses or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount when specific assets are determined to be impaired the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these definitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a threestep process the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired a second step is performed for that reporting unit this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the third step employed for any reporting unit that fails the second step is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative we do not follow this three step process in this case a qualitative evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired if it is the third step discussed above is performed to measure the amount of any potential impairment 

the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 

with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination thereof the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine our risk profile relative to the comparable companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium a control premium represents the value an investor would pay above noncontrolling interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate the attrition rate and expected future revenue and operating margins which vary among reporting units 

we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount or when we change our operating segments or reporting units 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the show occurs revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the show occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned or operated venues in the united states and where we control the tickets internationally revenue is recognized after the show occurs revenue for these ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs these service charges will be shared between our ticketing segment and our concerts segment for tickets sold for events at thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 



 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount premium and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues

 our assets 

we believe we have a unique portfolio of assets that is unmatched in the live entertainment industry 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 our history 

we were incorporated in delaware on august 2 2005 in preparation for the contribution and transfer by clear channel of substantially all of its entertainment assets and liabilities to us we completed the separation on december 21 2005 and became a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” 

on january 25 2010 we merged with ticketmaster effective on the date of the merger ticketmaster became a whollyowned subsidiary of live nation and live nation inc changed its name to live nation entertainment inc 

our industry 

we operate in five main industries within the live entertainment business including live music events venue operations ticketing services sponsorship and advertising sales and artist management and services 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents directly contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with artists to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from artists for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours one to four months typically elapse between booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise venue sponsorships parking and premium seating 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology on these box office tickets the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting their fee as ticket sales increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

ticketing “resale” services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue promoter or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue promoter or other entity generally the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

  

artist management primarily provides services to music recording artists to manage their careers the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings artist services sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet and also sells premium ticket packages and services 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies desiring to advertise or promote their brand or product the advertising campaigns typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online banner advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage hotel and telecommunications these promotional programs may include event presales and onsite product activation 

our business 

our reportable segments are concerts ticketing artist nation and sponsorship  advertising prior to 2012 we reported an ecommerce segment which is now included in our ticketing and sponsorship  advertising segments specifically all online advertising and online sponsorships previously reported in the ecommerce segment are now reported in the sponsorship  advertising segment while all other activity has been included in the ticketing segment this change was made to be consistent with how the four key components of the business are now being managed information related to these operating segments and other operations for 2012 2011 and 2010 is included in note 13—segment data in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

concerts our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world during 2012 our concerts business generated approximately 39 billion or 665 of our total revenue we promoted 22000 live music events in 2012 including artists such as madonna lady gaga coldplay roger waters bruce springsteen  the e street band van halen and the dave matthews band and through festivals such as rock werchter download creamfields and reading while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur may through september 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own andor operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

as a festival operator we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also arrange for thirdparties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue will generally result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a convenience charge and order processing fee for our services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients across multiple live event categories providing ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through a combination of websites telephone services mobile devices and ticket outlets during the year ended december 31 2012 we sold 78 6 4 and 12 of primary tickets through these channels respectively our ticketing segment also manages our online activities including enhancements to our websites and bundled product offerings during 2012 our ticketing business generated approximately 14 billion or 236 of our total revenue which excludes the face value of tickets sold through all of our ticketing services we sold over 148 million tickets in 2012 and sold an additional 108 million tickets through our venue clients’ box offices our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients 

  

we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine and then tell us what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket face price will be agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider where we have exclusive contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute group sales and season tickets inhouse in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and does not make those tickets available for sale by us we also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs or other similar arrangements from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales as a result we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any single client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services through ticketsnow in the united states and canada our ticketexchange service in the united states europe and canada and get me in in the united kingdom through ticketsnow and get me in we enter into listing agreements with ticket resellers to post ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a ticket resale price determined by the ticket reseller plus an amount equal to a percentage of the ticket resale price and a predetermined service fee we remit the ticket resale price to the ticket resellers and retain the remainder of the purchase price while we do not generally acquire tickets for sale on our own behalf we may do so from time to time on a limited basis in addition to enabling premium primary ticket sales the ticketexchange service allows consumers to resell and purchase tickets online for certain events that were initially sold for our venue clients who elect to participate in the ticketexchange service sellers and buyers each pay a fee that has been negotiated with the relevant client a portion of which is shared with the client 

artist nation  our artist nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists our artist nation segment also sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet and also provides other services to artists during 2012 our artist nation business generated approximately 400 million or 69 of our total revenue revenue earned from our artist nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists we represent generally we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from may through september tends to be a popular time for touring events 

sponsorship  advertising our sponsorship  advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors through a combination of strategic international national and local opportunities for businesses to reach customers through our concert venue artist relationship and ticketing assets including advertising on our websites we work with our corporate clients to help create marketing programs that promote their brand andor product during 2012 our sponsorship  advertising business generated approximately 248 million or 43 of our total revenue 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships both domestically and internationally and placement of advertising including signage online advertising and promotional programs many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national and international sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for advertisers our sponsorship programs include companies such as starwood american express vodafone anheuser busch citi and hertz each of the preceding brands is a registered trademark of the sponsor our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had booking rights for andor had an equity interest in as of december 31 2012 

 

 competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music events sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition or financial marketing support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from both promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

our main competitors in the live music industry include aeg and c3 presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe anschutz entertainment group operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own andor operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have various alternatives to our venues when scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg aeg and the nederlander organization in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through telephone services mobile devices and ticket outlets as online ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

  

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events resale ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts has created more aggressive buying of primary tickets whereby brokers are using bot technology to attempt to buy the best tickets when they go on sale the internet allows fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and provides consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan veritix and cts eventim online and event companies such as eventbrite etix and ticketfly and secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

in the artist management business we compete with other artist managers both at larger talent representation companies such as red light management as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals in the artist services business we compete with companies typically only involved in one or a few of the services we provide some of these competitors include bill young productions bravado artist arena and global merchandising 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships and advertising dollars include local sports teams which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages additionally our competitors locally can include festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and the dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and the dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada the dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

  

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries we operate in and also the united states fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol more recently some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” “ticketmaster” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation ticketmaster house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered our most significant trademarks in numerous foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 7100 fulltime employees including 4700 domestic and 2400 international employees of which approximately 6900 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 200 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees primarily for our live music venues as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 5800 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 14000 seasonal employees in 2012 the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business our leverage our convertible notes our common stock our separation from clear channel ticketmaster’s spinoff from iac our merger with ticketmaster and our general business operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and is dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and is dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform at live music events any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams our artist services business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise 

  

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but it may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships between key promoters executives agents managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist services business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss in the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts including musical artists 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order “order processing” fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist services industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who choose to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through venue box offices and season subscription or group sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the advent of new technology particularly as it relates to online ticketing has amplified this competition the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline in 2010 we divested ticketmaster’s paciolan ticketing business which further increased the competition that we face as a result of our merger with ticketmaster we may face direct competition in the live music industry with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions include those that are selfimposed imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the ftc and the attorneys general of several individual states and statutory these restrictions primarily relate to our ticketsnow business and include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our ticketsnow resale website without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any changes to our current ticketmasterticketsnow linking practices a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that among other things contain the unique names of venues sports teams or performers or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on the ticketsnow website or any other resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures and in certain instances to create separate listings when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market through our ticketsnow business or otherwise may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the artist services industry is also a highly competitive industry there are numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone we compete with these companies and individuals to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established artists in addition certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist services business are terminable at will by either party leading to competition to retain those artists as clients competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist services business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results from continuing operations have been adversely affected by among other things variability in ticket sales event profitability overhead costs and high amortization of intangibles related to prior acquisitions live nation incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately 1619 million 704 million and 2038 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we may face reduced demand for our live music events our ticketing software and services and other factors that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve or maintain profitability in future periods 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability 

  

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 

 

 our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during past economic slowdowns and recessions many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have recently had labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any further or future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

  

we operate in international markets in which we have limited experience and which may expose us to risks not found in doing business in the united states 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations are insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2012 our international operations accounted for approximately 36 of our revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate net losses of 25 million 13 million and 146 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively which had a negative effect on our operating income see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect our results of operations and the price of our common stock 

as part of our growth strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

such actions by us could adversely affect our results from operations and the price of our common stock 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions acquisitions involve risks including those associated with 

 

  

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things expenses to pursue the acquisition and the incurrence of debt in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more unfavorable events or trends which could result in impairment charges the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may choose to substantially reduce or discontinue the operations of any of our acquired businesses if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges any such shutdown could expose us to expenses associated with exiting from existing contracts and terminating employees and could expose us to certain unknown liabilities that arise following the shutdown 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the doj with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in other jurisdictions also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

our businesses may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards 

the ticketing industry is characterized by evolving industry standards frequent new service and product introductions enhancements and changing customer demands we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements and preferences and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the continued widespread adoption of new internet or telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our respective services or infrastructures our failure to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures in response to these trends could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are currently in the process of replatforming our ticketmaster ticketing system and migrating our international brands and businesses to a common ticketing platform in an attempt to provide consistent and stateoftheart services across our businesses and to reduce the cost and expense of maintaining multiple systems which we may not be able to complete in a timely or costeffective manner delays or difficulties in making these changes to our ticketing systems as well as any new or enhanced systems may limit our ability to achieve the desired results in a timely manner also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or festival sites that we own or rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events which could cause a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and the protection of the data contained in such systems system interruption the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures and breaches or lapses in the security protecting these systems may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information technology systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we lack documentation regarding certain components of our key ticketing software and systems operations and rely on certain key technology personnel to maintain such software and systems the loss of some or all of such personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain such software and systems and could subject us to frequent systems interruptions we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in their systems and infrastructures their businesses andor third parties or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair our ability to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism other acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information and data could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation and other liabilities network security issues could lead to claims against us for other misuse of personal information such as for unauthorized purposes or identity theft which could result in litigation and financial liabilities as well as administrative action from governmental authorities in addition security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties it is possible that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries undetected fraud inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data as a result current security measures may not prevent any or all security breaches we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

in the processing of consumer transactions we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by our respective privacy and data security policies moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storage sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by us our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from trying our products and services andor result in fines andor proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable rates including coverage for acts of terrorism and weatherrelated property damage we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in technology including our ticketing systems at december 31 2012 we had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 7218 million 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at reasonable rates to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable rates or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues and our technology therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand value and revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—uses of cash 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

we have generally registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation while we vigorously protect our trademarks service marks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our businesses have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions we consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or identify inventions and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain accordingly any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology in addition third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations while we attempt to conduct our business and operations in a manner that we believe to be in compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a law or regulation will not be interpreted or enforced in a manner contrary to our current understanding of the law or regulation in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol additionally new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we and our ticketsnow business are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey maryland and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and ticketsnow and other aspects of our ticketing business we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings including those described in note 7—commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated financial statements may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

  

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship  advertising segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

  

  

 additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our revenue depends in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional branding and other marketing campaigns for our live music events the live nation ticketmaster wwwticketmastercom  wwwlivenationcom and other brand names and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of events and ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related merchandise and apparel and costs related to search engine optimization and paid search engine marketing for our ecommerce sites during 2012 we spent approximately 39 of our revenue on marketing including advertising there can be no assurance that these marketing or advertising efforts will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following past terrorism actions some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our business the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

  

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

as of december 31 2012 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and premiums was approximately 1776 billion our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately 2361 million with outstanding letters of credit of approximately 639 million we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 621 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2013 3440 million is due in the aggregate for 2014 and 2015 8767 million is due in the aggregate for 2016 and 2017 and 4929 million is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 20 billion in operating lease agreements of which approximately 1189 million is due in 2013 and 1144 million is due in 2014 see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional debt or equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all capital markets have been volatile in the recent past a downturn could negatively impact our ability to access capital should the need arise as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs furthermore they may restrict our ability to expand to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations there under accelerated our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses could result in the loss of key tours or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to advance cash or post a letter of credit to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour additionally to secure new or retain existing ticketing clients we are often required by the client to make cash advances at the beginning andor periodically during the term of the agreement if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted similarly if we did not have enough cash on hand or access to cash required to advance to new ticketing clients or to continue to pay advances under existing ticketing agreements our ticketing business would be negatively impacted 

risks relating to our 2875 convertible senior notes 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments which may increase note holders’ credit risk 

in july 2007 we issued 220 million of 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended on july 15 2014 july 15 2017 and july 15 2022 or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts to the repurchase date in addition at any time on or prior to june 15 2027 we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to 1000 for each 1000 in principal amount of notes converted however it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes in addition some of our existing financing agreements contain and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness could contain provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt if we do not obtain such consent or refinance the debt we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 

  

the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 

if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july 15 2014 we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction furthermore holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july 15 2014 or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price there will be no increase in the conversion rate in addition in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and if we so elect holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 

prior to july 15 2027 the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock as applicable for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 

if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock including by making a net share settlement election the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined subject to certain exceptions by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the 20 trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion or if tendered within the 20 days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases after holders of notes tender their notes for conversion the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 

the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events including but not limited to the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock or for a thirdparty tender offer 

risks relating to our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

our stock price has fluctuated between 714 and 1690 over the past three years the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any director andor officer of the company who is also a director andor officer of clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate business opportunity a “corporate opportunity” for both us and clear channel we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel unless such opportunity is offered to a director andor officer of the company in writing solely in such person’s capacity as a director andor officer of the company clear channel will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

  

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline as of december 31 2012 there were 1909 million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including 32 million shares of unvested restricted stock awards 155 million shares of common stock issuable from options currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of 1346 per share 81 million shares issuable from the conversion of our 2875 convertible notes and a warrant to purchase 05 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1373 

we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of our 2875 convertible notes 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

risks relating to the separation 

if the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with the separation clear channel received both a private letter ruling from the irs and a legal opinion substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualified as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the irs were successful in taking this position clear channel could be subject to a significant united states federal income tax liability in general clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the separation otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the separation were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 

although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation 

  

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 

each member of the clear channel consolidated group which includes clear channel us and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel were unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 8—relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel 

risks relating to the spinoff from iac 

if the spinoff of ticketmaster from iac or one or more of the spincos were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos iac received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the qualification of these spinoffs as transactions that are generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos is referred to collectively as the iac spinoffs iac also received an opinion of counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that were not covered by the private letter ruling notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling and opinion of counsel the irs could determine that one or more of the iac spinoffs should be treated as a taxable distribution if it determines that any of the representations statements or assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the irs ruling in addition if any of the representations statements or assumptions upon which the opinion of counsel was based were or become inaccurate the opinion may be invalid 

if any of the iac spinoffs were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes then iac would incur material income tax liabilities for which we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable under applicable federal income tax rules ticketmaster is severally liable for any federal income taxes imposed on iac with respect to taxable periods during which ticketmaster was a member of iac’s consolidated federal income tax return group including the period in which the iac spinoffs were consummated under the tax sharing agreement that ticketmaster entered into with iac and the other spincos ticketmaster generally is required to indemnify iac and the other spincos for any taxes resulting from the spinoff to the extent such amounts resulted from i any act or failure to act by ticketmaster described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement ii any acquisition of equity securities or assets of ticketmaster or iii any breach by ticketmaster of any representation or covenant contained in the spinoff documents or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor tax opinions corresponding indemnification provisions also apply to the other spincos ticketmaster is entitled to indemnification from iac among other things if ticketmaster is liable for or otherwise required to make a payment in respect of a spinoff tax liability for which ticketmaster is not responsible under the tax sharing agreement and if applicable is unable to collect from the spinco responsible for such liability under the tax sharing agreement ticketmaster’s ability to collect under these indemnity provisions would depend on the financial position of the indemnifying party 

certain transactions in iac ticketmaster or other spinco equity securities could cause one or more of the iac spinoffs to be taxable to iac and may give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

current united states federal income tax law creates a presumption that any of the iac spinoffs would be taxable to iac if it is part of a “plan or series of related transactions” pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in iac or a spinco including ticketmaster acquisitions that occur during the fouryear period that begins two years before the date of a spinoff are presumed to occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions unless it is established that the acquisition is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions that includes the spinoff 

these rules limited ticketmaster’s ability during the twoyear period following the spinoff to enter into certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to us and our stockholders particularly issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs repurchasing equity securities and under certain circumstances acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities or agreeing to be acquired under the tax sharing agreement there were restrictions on ticketmaster’s ability to take such actions for a period of 25 months from the day after the date of the spinoff entering into the merger agreement with live nation did not violate these restrictions because prior to entering into the agreement ticketmaster provided iac with an unqualified opinion of tax counsel contemplated by the tax sharing agreement and iac confirmed that the opinion was satisfactory to iac we believe that we did not take any actions during the twoyear period following the spinoff that compromised the taxfree nature of that transaction however the statutes of limitations related to these tax periods remain open and if taxing authorities successfully assert tax claims against iac related to the spinoff it could give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

  

in addition to actions of iac and the spincos including ticketmaster certain transactions that are outside their control and therefore not subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the tax sharing agreement such as a sale or disposition of the stock of iac or the stock of a spinco by certain persons that own five percent or more of any class of stock of iac or a spinco could have a similar effect on the taxfree status of a spinoff as transactions to which iac or a spinco is a party 

as a result of these rules even if each iac spinoff otherwise qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes transactions involving spinco or iac equity securities including transactions by certain significant stockholders could cause iac to recognize taxable gain with respect to the stock of the spinco as described above although the restrictive covenants and indemnification provisions contained in the tax sharing agreement are intended to minimize the likelihood that such an event will occur one or more of the iac spinoffs may become taxable to iac as a result of transactions in iac or spinco equity securities as discussed previously we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable for such taxes under the tax sharing agreement or under applicable federal income tax rules 

in connection with the merger ticketmaster received i two unqualified opinions of tax counsel one dated as of the date of execution of the definitive merger agreement and one dated as of the closing date of the merger that the transaction as contemplated in the definitive merger agreement would not have an adverse tax effect on the spinoff and ii iac’s written acknowledgement that the closing date opinion was in form and substance satisfactory to iac however the irs may disagree with the conclusions in these opinions of counsel and determine that the merger caused the spinoff to be taxable to iac were this to occur and that position were sustained we as successorininterest to ticketmaster would be required to make material indemnification payments to iac 

risks relating to the merger 

in connection with the merger we became subject to a final judgment imposing certain obligations and restrictions on us which could negatively impact our business 

on july 30 2010 the united states district court for the district of columbia approved and entered a final judgment relating to the merger that imposes certain obligations on us in order to address the issues the doj raised in its antitrust review of the merger among other things the final judgment required us to offer a license to the ticketmaster ticketing technology to aeg and to divest ticketmaster’s paciolan ticketing business we have entered into a license agreement with aeg and sold paciolan to comcastspectacor lp thus satisfying those two requirements prospectively pursuant to the final judgment we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the final judgment the final judgment is in effect and will bind us until july 30 2020 

during the duration of the final judgment we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order our compliance with the final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

also on january 25 2010 we entered into a consent agreement with the canadian competition commission or the canadian consent agreement which had the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the final judgment on our business in canada the canadian consent agreement will remain in effect for ten years following the date of the agreement the canadian consent agreement creates similar risks for us both in terms of creating potential enforcement actions and in limiting us from pursuing certain business practices

 item 2 properties tableend as of december 31 2012 we own operate or lease 93 entertainment venues and 100 other facilities including office leases throughout north america and 22 entertainment venues and 82 other facilities internationally we believe our venues and facilities are generally wellmaintained and in good operating condition and have adequate capacity to meet our current business needs we have a lease ending june 30 2020 for our corporate headquarters in beverly hills california used primarily by our executive and domestic operations management staff

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend cts arbitration 

live nation worldwide inc or live nation worldwide and cts were parties to an agreement or the cts agreement pursuant to which cts was to develop and live nation worldwide licensed or agreed to use ticketing software or ticketing platforms under the agreement cts was to develop software to be licensed to live nation worldwide to provide ticketing services in the united states and canada the cts agreement also generally required live nation worldwide to use cts’s ticketing platforms in certain european countries so long as cts’s existing platforms were appropriately modified to meet local market conditions in june 2010 live nation worldwide terminated the cts agreement because cts materially breached the agreement by failing to deliver a north american ticketing system that met the contractual requirements of being a “world class ticketing system    that fits the needs of the north american market” and by failing to deliver a ticketing system for the united kingdom and other european countries that fit the needs of those markets as required by the cts agreement 

for north america had cts performed on the cts agreement it would have been generally entitled to receive during the then 10year term of the cts agreement a per ticket license fee upon the sale of certain tickets that live nation worldwide or any of certain of its subsidiaries which are collectively referred to as live nation worldwide entities controlled and had the right to distribute by virtue of certain promotion and venue management relations this per ticket fee for events in north america was payable to cts regardless of whether the live nation worldwide entities chose to use the cts ticketing platform ticketmaster’s ticketing platform or another ticketing platform for the sale of such controlled tickets for events in certain european countries not including the united kingdom live nation worldwide generally was required during a 10year term to exclusively book on the cts ticketing platform all tickets that the live nation worldwide entities had the right to distribute or to the extent other ticketing platforms were used live nation worldwide was generally required to pay to cts the same fee that would have been payable had the cts platform been used for events in the united kingdom live nation worldwide was required for a 10year term to i book on the cts ticketing platform all tickets controlled by live nation worldwide entities that were not allocated by live nation worldwide for sale through other sales channels and ii to offer for sale on the cts uk website a portion of the tickets controlled by the live nation worldwide entities finally the cts agreement obligated live nation worldwide and cts to negotiate a set of noncompete agreements that subject to legal restrictions could have precluded live nation worldwide from offering primary market ticketing services to third parties in certain european countries during the term of the cts agreement 

in april 2010 cts filed a request for arbitration with the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce or icc pursuant to the cts agreement in its request for arbitration cts asserts among other things that i the terms of the cts agreement including the north america per ticket license fee european exclusivity obligations and united kingdom distribution obligations described above apply to tickets sold and distributed by ticketmaster ii ticketmaster’s sales and distribution of tickets following the completion of the merger have resulted in various breaches of live nation worldwide’s obligations under the cts agreement iii live nation has failed to allocate the proper number of tickets to cts’s system in the united kingdom and iv the merger and our subsequent actions have breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its request for arbitration cts seeks relief in the form of a declaration that live nation and live nation worldwide are in breach of the cts agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing specific performance of live nation worldwide’s obligations under the cts agreement and unspecified damages resulting from such breaches in march 2011 cts provided further specifications on its claims and purported damages including a claim for royalties that would have been paid over the contemplated 10year term of the cts agreement and on ticketmastercontrolled tickets as well as tickets controlled by live nation worldwide or any of certain of its subsidiaries 

in may 2010 we responded to cts’s request for arbitration and filed counterclaims asserting that cts breached the cts agreement by failing to provide ticketing platforms that met the standard required by the cts agreement for the north american and european markets we are seeking relief primarily in the form of damages and a declaration that we validly terminated the cts agreement based on cts’s material breaches we deny that cts is entitled to collect damages for royalties that would have been paid over the full 10year term of the cts agreement or on ticketmastercontrolled tickets the matter has been assigned to an arbitrator and hearings were conducted in the summer and fall of 2011 a decision from the arbitrator is currently expected by spring of 2013 while we do not believe that a loss is probable of occurring at this time if the arbitrator rules against us on any or all claims the amounts at stake could be substantial considerable uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the claims and damages asserted against us as a result we are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for this matter we intend to continue to vigorously defend the action 

ticketing fees consumer class action litigation 

in october 2003 a putative representative action was filed in the superior court of california challenging ticketmaster’s charges to online customers for shipping fees and alleging that its failure to disclose on its website that the charges contain a profit component is unlawful the complaint asserted a claim for violation of california’s unfair competition law or ucl and sought restitution or disgorgement of the difference between i the total shipping fees charged by ticketmaster in connection with online ticket sales during the applicable period and ii the amount that ticketmaster actually paid to the shipper for delivery of those tickets in august 2005 the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint then pleading the case as a putative class action and adding the claim that ticketmaster’s website disclosures in respect of its ticket order processing fees constitute false advertising in violation of california’s false advertising law on this new claim the amended complaint seeks restitution or disgorgement of the entire amount of order processing fees charged by ticketmaster during the applicable period in april 2009 the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a second amended complaint adding new claims that a ticketmaster’s order processing fees are unconscionable under the ucl and b ticketmaster’s alleged business practices further violate the california consumer legal remedies act plaintiffs later filed a third amended complaint to which ticketmaster filed a demurrer in july 2009 the court overruled ticketmaster’s demurrer in october 2009 

  

the plaintiffs filed a class certification motion in august 2009 which ticketmaster opposed in february 2010 the court granted certification of a class on the first and second causes of action which allege that ticketmaster misrepresentsomits the fact of a profit component in ticketmaster’s shipping and order processing fees the class would consist of california consumers who purchased tickets through ticketmaster’s website from 1999 to present the court denied certification of a class on the third and fourth causes of action which allege that ticketmaster’s shipping and order processing fees are unconscionably high in march 2010 ticketmaster filed a petition for writ of mandate with the california court of appeal and plaintiffs also filed a motion for reconsideration of the superior court’s class certification order in april 2010 the superior court denied plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the court’s class certification order and the court of appeal denied ticketmaster’s petition for writ of mandate in june 2010 the court of appeal granted the plaintiffs’ petition for writ of mandate and ordered the superior court to vacate its february 2010 order denying plaintiffs’ motion to certify a national class and enter a new order granting plaintiffs’ motion to certify a nationwide class on the first and second claims in september 2010 ticketmaster filed its motion for summary judgment on all causes of action in the superior court and that same month plaintiffs filed their motion for summary adjudication of various affirmative defenses asserted by ticketmaster in november 2010 ticketmaster filed their motion to decertify class 

in december 2010 the parties entered into a binding agreement providing for the settlement of the litigation and the resolution of all claims therein in september 2011 the court declined to approve the settlement in its thencurrent form litigation continued and in september 2011 the court granted in part and denied in part ticketmaster’s motion for summary judgment the parties reached a new settlement in september 2011 which was approved preliminarily but in september 2012 the court declined to grant final approval in doing so the court identified potential modifications to the settlement and the parties continue to discuss such potential modifications and the possibility of a revised settlement agreement ticketmaster and its parent live nation have not acknowledged any violations of law or liability in connection with the matter 

as of december 31 2012 we have accrued 354 million our best estimate of the probable costs associated with the settlement referred to above this liability includes an estimated redemption rate any difference between our estimated redemption rate and the actual redemption rate we experience will impact the final settlement amount however we do not expect this difference to be material 

canadian consumer class action litigation relating to ticketsnow 

in february 2009 four putative consumer class action complaints were filed in various provinces of canada against ticketsnow ticketmaster ticketmaster canada ltd and premium inventory inc all of the cases allege essentially the same set of facts and causes of action each plaintiff purports to represent a class consisting of all persons who purchased a ticket from ticketmaster ticketmaster canada ltd or ticketsnow from february 2007 to present and alleges that ticketmaster conspired to divert a large number of tickets for resale through the ticketsnow website at prices higher than face value the plaintiffs characterize these actions as being in violation of ontario’s ticket speculation act the amusement act of manitoba the amusement act of alberta or the quebec consumer protection act the ontario case contains the additional allegation that ticketmaster’s and ticketsnow’s service fees violate antiscalping laws each lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of the class 

in february 2012 the parties entered into a settlement agreement that will resolve all of the resale market claims the court approval process for the settlement has been completed with final approvals given in all provinces 

as of december 31 2012 we have accrued our best estimate of the probable costs associated with the resale market claims of this matter the full amount of which was funded by an escrow established in connection with ticketmaster’s 2008 acquisition of ticketsnow 

while it is reasonably possible that a loss related to the primary market claims of this matter could be incurred by us in a future period we do not believe that a loss is probable of occurring at this time considerable uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the claims and damages asserted against us as a result we are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for the primary market claims of this matter we intend to continue to vigorously defend all claims in all of the actions

concerts 

our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world while our concerts segment operates yearround we generally experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and festivals which primarily occur may through september revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs all advertising costs for shows are expensed at the end of the year for any future events 

  

to judge the health of our concerts segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events in our network of owned andor operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance and advance ticket sales in addition at our owned andor operated venues we monitor attendance ancillary revenue per fan and premium seat sales for business that is conducted in foreign markets we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods on a constant currency basis

sponsorship  advertising revenue increased 171 million or 7 during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year excluding the decrease of 50 million related to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates revenue increased 221 million or 10 resulting primarily from expansion of existing and new sponsorship agreements online advertising growth and higher festival sponsorships driven by increased international festival activity 

sponsorship  advertising direct operating expense increased 11 million or 3 during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year excluding the decrease of 06 million related to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates direct operating expenses increased 17 million or 5 primarily driven by higher costs associated with the increase in revenue 

sponsorship  advertising selling general and administrative expenses increased 54 million or 17 during the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year excluding the decrease of 02 million related to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates selling general and administrative expenses increased 56 million or 17 primarily related to increased headcount and compensation costs to drive higher digital and sponsorship sales 

  

the increased operating income was primarily due to higher sponsorship and online advertising activity including increased international festival sponsorships partially offset by increased headcount expenses to sell and manage the higher revenue 

year ended 2011 compared to year ended 2010 

sponsorship  advertising revenue increased 306 million or 15 during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the prior year excluding the increase of 49 million related to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates revenue increased 257 million or 13 primarily due to new sponsorship relationships renewal or expansion of existing arrangements increased online advertising and expansion of our sponsorship operations to additional countries 

sponsorship  advertising direct operating expense increased 52 million or 18 during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the prior year excluding the increase of 10 million related to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates direct operating expenses increased 42 million or 15 primarily driven by higher fulfillment costs related to the increased revenue 

the increased operating income was primarily due to new sponsor and advertising relationships and higher international festival sponsorships 

reconciliation of segment adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration arrangements merger bonuses payments under the azoff trust note and acquisitionrelated severance depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment loss gain on sale of operating assets and noncash and certain stockbased compensation expense including expense associated with grants of certain stockbased awards which were classified as liabilities  we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

  

the following table sets forth the computation of adjusted operating income loss 

 

   

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

our balance sheets reflect cash and cash equivalents of 10 billion at december 31 2012 and 8443 million at december 31 2011 included in the december 31 2012 and 2011 cash and cash equivalents balance is 4416 million and 3739 million respectively of funds representing amounts equal to the face value of tickets sold on behalf of clients and the clients’ share of convenience and order processing charges or client funds we do not utilize client funds for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients our foreign subsidiaries hold approximately 4735 million in cash and cash equivalents excluding client cash we do not intend to repatriate these funds but would need to accrue and pay united states federal and state income taxes on any future repatriations net of applicable foreign tax credits we may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility if the original maturity of these borrowings is ninety days or less we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis on the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities our balance sheets reflect current and longterm debt of 17 billion at december 31 2012 and 17 billion at december 31 2011 our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the debt discounts on our term loan and convertible notes was 52 at december 31 2012 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in interestbearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds  while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned andor operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client funds less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and for cash collected on behalf of others for ticket sales plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default

other debt 

in june 2012 we entered into an additional debt agreement where we borrowed 342 million of floating rate debt primarily to fund our operations in australia

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash on its balance sheet at the time of acquisition all amounts discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2012 we used 756 million in cash primarily for acquisitions in our concerts segment of coppel in april 2012 and cream in may 2012 

during 2011 we used 395 million in cash primarily for the acquisitions in our artist nation segment of interests in four artist management companies in the united kingdom and the united states the april 2011 acquisition in our ticketing segment of serviticket and the december 2011 acquisition of bigchampagne the october 2011 acquisition in our artist nation segment of tshirt printers and the december 2011 acquisition in our concerts segment of lnhs concerts 

  

during 2010 our cash increased by 4915 million from acquisitions in our concerts ticketing artist nation and sponsorship  advertising segments primarily related to ticketmaster cash on hand at the time of the merger partially offset by our acquisition of ticketnet a ticketing company in france 

purchases of intangibles 

in 2012 we used 146 million in cash primarily related to the acquisition of the rights to a festival in europe 

in 2011 and 2010 we used 26 million and 18 million respectively in cash primarily related to a naming rights agreement for a festival in europe 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing system to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network or the development of new online or ticketing tools or technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to add revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance companies consisted of the following 

 

 maintenance capital expenditures for 2012 decreased from the prior year primarily due to a reduction in venuerelated projects and office renovations or relocations 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2012 increased from the prior year primarily related to our investment in technology and renovation and development of various venues 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2011 increased from the prior year primarily due to expenditures relating to the integration of our financial systems and offices as a result of the merger along with higher maintenance expenditures related to venues ticketing technology and client ticketing equipment 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2011 increased from the prior year primarily related to the replatforming of our ticketing system and website enhancements 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 1200 million for the year ending december 31 2013 

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and many of the venues used in our concert operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

  

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditure commitments as of december 31 2012 are as follows 

 

  

 

  

  

 during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 231 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2013 through 2017 are 16 million each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business the buyer assumed our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2012 

aggregate minimum rentals of 873 million to be received in years 2013 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 127 million and 131 million for each of the respective periods primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards and obligations under a venue management agreement 

  

cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

year ended 2012 compared to year ended 2011 

cash provided by operating activities was 3671 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 1357 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 2314 million increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from net changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing of ticket sales along with the size and number of events for upcoming periods during 2012 we sold more tickets for future events than we did in 2011 which increased deferred revenue partially offset by higher payments of prepaid eventrelated expenses for those future events in addition we collected more accounts receivable had lower longterm artistrelated payments and paid less accrued eventrelated expenses as compared to the same period in the prior year also contributing to the increase in cash provided by operating activities was 222 million in payments made in 2011 related to the acquisition of certain remaining equity interests in front line that were classified as liabilities 

year ended 2011 compared to year ended 2010 

cash provided by operating activities was 1357 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 1585 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 228 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the net changes in the operating balance sheet accounts largely offset by the increase in the cashrelated portion of net income in 2011 we received less deferred revenue and increased accounts receivable and other assets partially offset by lower prepaid expenses as compared to the prior year also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was 222 million in payments made in 2011 related to the acquisition of certain remaining equity interests in front line that were classified as liabilities 

investing activities 

year ended 2012 compared to year ended 2011 

cash used in investing activities was 2038 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 1520 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 518 million increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher payments for acquisitions purchases of property plant and equipment primarily related to technology and intangible assets partially offset by lower payments for investments made in nonconsolidated affiliates see “—uses of cash” above for further discussion 

year ended 2011 compared to year ended 2010 

cash used in investing activities was 1520 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 4530 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 6050 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 5765 million of cash acquired in the merger in 2010 less proceeds from the disposals of assets and an increase in purchases of property plant and equipment 

financing activities 

year ended 2012 compared to year ended 2011 

cash used in financing activities was 199 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 444 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the 245 million decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily a result of net proceeds received in 2012 from the issuance of the 7 senior notes and increased term loan b borrowings after repayment of the 1075 senior notes and related costs along with additional financing to fund australian operations as compared to a net pay down in 2011 on the term loans we also made less payments of deferred and contingent consideration in 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 also contributing to the decrease was cash used in 2011 for purchases of noncontrolling interests for the remaining equity interests in front line these decreases in cash used were partially offset by proceeds received in 2011 from the sale of common stock in connection with the subscription agreement with liberty media 

  

year ended 2011 compared to year ended 2010 

cash used in financing activities was 444 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 491 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 935 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily a result of net proceeds received in 2010 from the issuance of 250 million of 8125 senior notes and our new senior secured credit facility after repayment of the borrowings under the live nation and ticketmaster credit facilities payment of debt issuance costs and the redemption of preferred stock as compared to only a net pay down in 2011 on the term loans the increase was also a result of cash used for purchases of noncontrolling interests primarily related to the 2011 acquisition of the remaining equity interests in front line these increases were partially offset by proceeds received in 2011 from the sale of common stock in connection with the subscription agreement with liberty media 

seasonality 

our concerts and artist nation segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and international festivals are primarily used or occur during may through september and our artists touring activity is higher in addition the timing of ticket onsales and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs generally all costs related to events are expensed when the event occurs with the exception of advertising costs which are expensed either at the time of the event or annually for future shows once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales in advance of when the event occurs for events at our owned andor operated venues we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a—risk factors our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 1141 million for the year ended december 31 2012 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2012 by 114 million as of december 31 2012 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income and shortterm intercompany loans at december 31 2012 we had forward currency contracts and options outstanding with a notional amount of 1000 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 17 billion of total debt net of unamortized discounts and premiums outstanding as of december 31 2012 of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 8541 million of fixedrate debt and 8859 million of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2012 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 23 million when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2012 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

at december 31 2012 we have one interest rate cap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes the interest rate cap had a notional amount of 775 million at december 31 2012 to limit our cash flow exposure to an interest rate of 4 per annum this agreement expires on june 30 2013 the fair value of this agreement at december 31 2012 was a de minimis asset this agreement was put in place to reduce the variability of a portion of the cash flows from the interest payments related to the may 2010 senior secured credit facility the terms of the may 2010 senior secured credit facility require one or more interest rate protection agreements with an effect of fixing or limiting the interest costs for at least 50 of the consolidated total funded debt as of the closing date for at least three years upon the execution of this interest rate cap agreement the existing interest rate protection agreements fully met this requirement 

  

at december 31 2012 we have an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes the interest rate swap had a notional amount of 156 million at december 31 2012 to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis and expires in may 2015 the fair value of this agreement at december 31 2012 was a liability of 02 million this agreement was put into place to reduce the variability of the cash flows from the interest payments related to certain financing 

through our amg subsidiary we have two interest rate swap agreements with a 322 million aggregate notional amount that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis both agreements expire in december 2015 also in connection with the financing of the redevelopment of the o 2 dublin we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 85 million that expires in december 2013 effectively converting a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

we currently have 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 with a principal amount of 220 million beginning with the period commencing on july 20 2014 and ending on january 14 2015 and for each of the interest periods commencing thereafter we will pay contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120 of the principal amount of the notes the contingent interest payable per note will equal 025 per year of the average trading price of such note during the applicable five tradingday reference period payable in arrears 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued guidance that improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements this guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including 1 the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts 2 measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s stockholders’ equity and 3 quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 it also requires additional disclosure for level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs we adopted this guidance on january 1 2012 and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in july 2012 the fasb issued guidance which gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired and in some cases bypass the twostep impairment test this guidance is effective for annual and interim indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption of the new guidance is permitted we adopted this guidance on october 1 2012 

recently issued pronouncements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

  

consolidation 

we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a significant reduction in operating cash flow or a dramatic change in the manner that the asset is intended to be used indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a significant reduction in operating cash flow or a dramatic change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis based on facts and circumstances we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for impairment if a qualitative assessment is performed and the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then we perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount when specific assets are determined to be impaired the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these definitelived and indefinitelived assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

  

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a threestep process the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units are less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of a quantitative assessment if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely than not impaired a second step is performed for that reporting unit this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the third step employed for any reporting unit that fails the second step is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill if a reporting unit’s carrying value is negative we do not follow this three step process in this case a qualitative evaluation is performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s goodwill is impaired if it is the third step discussed above is performed to measure the amount of any potential impairment 

the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination thereof the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine its risk profile relative to the comparable companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium a control premium represents the value an investor would pay above noncontrolling interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate the attrition rate and expected future revenue and operating margins which vary among reporting units 

we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the performance occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned andor operated venues in the united states and where we control the tickets internationally this revenue is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue for these ticket fees collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs these fees will be shared between our ticketing segment and our concerts segment for tickets sold for events at thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

for multiple element contracts we allocate consideration to the multiple elements based on the relative fair selling price of each separate element which are determined using vendor specific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or our best estimate in order to assign relative fair values 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

  

noncash and stockbased compensation 

we follow the fair value recognition provisions of the fasb guidance for stock compensation in accordance with this guidance we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates noncash compensation expense could be materially impacted 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

  

 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and premium and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues

 our assets 

we believe we have a unique portfolio of assets that is unmatched in the live entertainment industry 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 our history 

we were incorporated in delaware on august 2 2005 in preparation for the spinoff of substantially all of clear channel’s entertainment assets and liabilities the separation was completed on december 21 2005 at which point we became a publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” 

on january 25 2010 we completed our merger with ticketmaster effective on the date of the merger ticketmaster became a whollyowned subsidiary of live nation and live nation inc changed its name to live nation entertainment inc 

under the terms of the agreement reached with the doj in connection with obtaining regulatory clearance for the merger we agreed to divest our ticketing subsidiary paciolan and to license the ticketmaster ticketing system to aeg for a period of up to five years in addition to other terms intended to protect competitive conditions in ticketing and promotions in march 2010 we sold paciolan to comcastspectacor lp 

our industry 

we operate in four main industries within the live entertainment business including live music events venue operations ticketing software and services and artist management and services 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music events or tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents directly contract with artists to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with artists to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from artists for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets artists are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse artists for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with artists and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours one to four months typically elapse between booking artists and the first performances promoters in conjunction with artists managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates and receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as rental income in addition venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise venue sponsorships parking and premium seating 

  

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology on these box office tickets the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting their fee as ticket purchases increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

ticketing “resale” services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue promoter or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue promoter or other entity generally the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

artist management primarily provides services to music recording artists to manage their career the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings artist services sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet and also sells premium ticket packages 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies desiring to advertise or promote their brand or product the advertising campaigns typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online banner advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage hotel and telecommunications these promotional programs may include event presales and product onsite activation 

our business

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay artists under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own andor operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of concessions parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of concessions is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

  

as a festival operator we typically book artists secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract fans we also arrange for thirdparties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay artists a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of concessions camping fees festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income

we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally communicate what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket face price will be agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider where we have exclusive contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute group sales and season tickets inhouse in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and does not make those tickets available for sale by us we also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs or other similar arrangements from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales as a result we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any single client from year to year 

we currently offer ticket resale services through ticketsnow in the united states and canada our ticketexchange service in the united states europe and canada and get me in in the united kingdom through ticketsnow and get me in we enter into listing agreements with ticket resellers to post ticket inventory for sale at a purchase price equal to a ticket resale price determined by the ticket reseller plus an amount equal to a percentage of the ticket resale price and a predetermined service fee we remit the resellerdetermined ticket resale price to the ticket resellers and retain the remainder of the purchase price while we do not generally acquire tickets for sale on our own behalf we may do so from time to time on a limited basis in addition to enabling premium primary ticket sales the ticketexchange service allows consumers to resell and purchase tickets online for certain events that were initially sold for our venue clients who elect to participate in the ticketexchange service sellers and buyers each pay a fee that has been negotiated with the relevant client a portion of which is shared with the client

 the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned leased operated had booking rights for andor had an equity interest in as of december 31 2011 

 

 competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music products sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition financial marketing service support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

  

our main competitors in the live music industry include aeg marek lieberberg konzertagentur and c3 presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe anschutz entertainment group operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and may have greater financial resources in those markets which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own andor operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg and aeg in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets and may have greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels as online ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events the advent of ecommerce has also contributed to the growth of resale ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts the internet has allowed fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and has provided consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors include primary ticketing companies such as ticketscom axs paciolan and cts eventim online and event companies such as eventbrite and ticketfly and secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

in the artist management business we compete with other artist managers both at larger talent representation companies such as red light management as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals in the artist services business we compete with companies typically only involved in one or a few of the services we provide some of these competitors include bill young productions bravado and artist arena 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships include local sports teams which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages additionally our competitors locally can include festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries we operate in and also the united states fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act 2010 regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay promise to pay or receive money or anything of value to or from any government or foreign public official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol more recently some jurisdictions have proposed legislation that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” “ticketmaster” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation ticketmaster house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered our most significant trademarks in many foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 6600 fulltime employees including 4300 domestic and 2300 international employees of which approximately 6470 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 130 were employed in our corporate group 

  

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees primarily for our live music venues as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 3500 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 13000 seasonal employees in 2011 the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our business our leverage our convertible notes our common stock our separation from clear channel our merger with ticketmaster and our general business operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our business 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform live music content any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams our artist services business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or an artist cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as foregone revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if an artist cancels a tour but it may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships with key promoters executives managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist services business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss in the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts 

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and direct sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order “order processing” fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our 

  

ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist services industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who are increasingly choosing to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through facility box offices and season subscription or group sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline in 2010 we divested ticketmaster’s paciolan ticketing business which further increases the competition that we face relatedly as a result of our merger with ticketmaster we may face direct competition in the live music industry with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions are both selfimposed and imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the ftc and the attorneys general of several individual states these restrictions primarily relate to our ticketsnow business and include restrictions on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our ticketsnow resale website without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any changes to our current ticketmasterticketsnow linking practices a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that among other things contain the unique names of venues sports teams or performers or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on the ticketsnow website or any other resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market through our ticketsnow business or otherwise may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the artist services industry is also a highly competitive industry there are numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone we compete with these companies and individuals to 

  

discover new and emerging artists and to represent established acts in addition certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist services business are terminable at will by either party leading to competition to retain those artists as clients competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist services business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results from continuing operations have been adversely affected by among other things variability in ticket sales event profitability overhead costs and high amortization of intangibles related to prior acquisitions live nation incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately 704 million 2038 million and 1260 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we may face reduced demand for our live music events our ticketing software and services and other factors that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability 

  

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 

 

 our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during past economic slowdowns and recessions many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events many of the factors affecting the number and availability of live entertainment sporting and leisure events are beyond our control for instance certain sports leagues have recently had labor disputes leading to threatened or actual player lockouts any such lockouts that result in shortened or canceled seasons would adversely impact our business to the extent that we provide ticketing services to the affected teams both due to the loss of games and ticketing opportunities as well as the possibility of decreased attendance following such a lockout due to adverse fan reaction 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any further or future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we operate in international markets in which we have limited experience and which may expose us to risks not found in doing business in the united states 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations are insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2011 our international operations accounted for approximately 39 of our revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro and canadian dollar we experienced foreign exchange rate net losses of 13 million 146 million and 399 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively which had a negative effect on our operating income see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our growth strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

  

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully complete the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors and may include our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions acquisitions involve risks including those associated with 

 

  

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things expenses to pursue the acquisition and the incurrence of debt in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more unfavorable events or trends which could result in impairment charges the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may choose to substantially reduce or discontinue the operations of any of our acquired businesses if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges any such shutdown could expose us to expenses associated with exiting from existing contracts and terminating employees and could expose us to certain unknown liabilities that arise following the shutdown 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the doj with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in other jurisdictions also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

our businesses may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards 

the ecommerce industry is characterized by evolving industry standards frequent new service and product introductions enhancements and changing customer demands we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements and preferences and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the continued widespread adoption of new internet or telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our respective services or infrastructures our failure to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures in response to these trends could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are currently in the process of replatforming our ticketmaster ticketing system and migrating our international brands and businesses to a common ticketing platform in an attempt to provide consistent and stateoftheart 

  

services across our businesses and to reduce the cost and expense of maintaining multiple systems which we may not be able to complete in a timely or costeffective manner delays or difficulties in making these changes to our ticketing systems as well as any new or enhanced systems may limit our ability to achieve the desired results in a timely manner also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or venues that we rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events causing a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and the protection of the data contained in such systems system interruption the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures and breaches or lapses in the security protecting these systems may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information technology systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we lack documentation regarding certain components of our key ticketing software and systems operations and rely on certain key technology personnel to maintain such software and systems the loss of some or all of such personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain such software and systems and could subject us to frequent systems interruptions we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in their systems and infrastructures their businesses andor third parties or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair our ability to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism other acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information and data could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation and other liabilities network security issues could lead to claims against us for other misuse of personal information such as for unauthorized purposes or identity theft which could result in litigation and financial liabilities as well as administrative action from governmental authorities in addition security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties it is possible that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries undetected fraud inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data as a result current security measures may not prevent any or all security breaches we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against 

  

and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

in the processing of consumer transactions we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by our respective privacy and data security policies moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storage sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by us our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from trying our products and services andor result in fines andor proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs including coverage for acts of terrorism and weatherrelated property damage we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in information technology systems including our ticketing systems at december 31 2011 we had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 7201 million 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at reasonable costs to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

  

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues and our technology therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand value and revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

we have generally registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation while we vigorously protect our trademarks service marks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our businesses have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions we consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or identify inventions and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain accordingly any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar 

  

technology in addition third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol additionally new legislation could be passed that may negatively impact our business such as provisions that have recently been proposed in various jurisdictions that would restrict ticketing methods mandate ticket inventory disclosure and attack current policies governing season tickets for sports teams 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we and our ticketsnow business are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and ticketsnow and other aspects of our ticketing business we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings including those described in note 8—commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated financial statements may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against thirdparty lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

  

  

 additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

  

our revenue depends in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional branding and other marketing campaigns for our live music events the live nation ticketmaster wwwticketmastercom  wwwlivenationcom and other brand names and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of events and ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related merchandise and apparel and costs related to search engine optimization and paid search engine marketing for our ecommerce sites during 2011 we spent approximately 41 of our revenue on marketing including advertising there can be no assurance that these marketing or advertising efforts will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as concession and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following past terrorism actions some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our business the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

as of december 31 2011 our total indebtedness excluding unamortized debt discounts and premiums was approximately 1732 billion our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately 2412 million with outstanding letters of credit of approximately 588 million we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 526 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2012 2935 million is due in the aggregate for 2013 and 2014 1126 billion is due in the aggregate for 2015 and 2016 and 2597 million is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 17 billion in operating lease agreements of which approximately 1101 million is due in 2012 and 1014 million is due in 2013 see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist and ticketing advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we cannot predict the impact to our ability to access additional capital in light of the current uncertainty in the credit market if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service or lease obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

  

these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs furthermore they may restrict our ability to expand to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations thereunder accelerated our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring and ticketing businesses could result in the loss of key tours or the inability to secure and retain ticketing clients 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to advance cash or post a letter of credit to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour additionally to secure new or retain existing ticketing clients we are often required by the client to make cash advances at the beginning andor periodically during the term of the agreement if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted similarly if we did not have enough cash on hand or access to cash required to advance to new ticketing clients or to continue to pay advances under existing ticketing agreements our ticketing business would be negatively impacted 

risks relating to our 2875 convertible senior notes 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments which may increase note holders’ credit risk 

in july 2007 we issued 220 million of 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended on july 15 2014 july 15 2017 and july 15 2022 or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts to the repurchase date in addition at any time on or prior to june 15 2027 we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to 1000 for each 1000 in principal amount of notes converted however it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes in addition some of our existing financing agreements contain and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness could contain provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt if we do not obtain such consent or refinance the debt we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 

  

the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 

if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july 15 2014 we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction furthermore holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july 15 2014 or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price there will be no increase in the conversion rate in addition in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and if we so elect holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 

prior to july 15 2027 the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock as applicable for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 

if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock including by making a net share settlement election the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined subject to certain exceptions by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the 20 trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion or if tendered within the 20 days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases after holders of notes tender their notes for conversion the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 

the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events including but not limited to the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock or for a thirdparty tender offer 

  

risks relating to our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

our stock price has fluctuated between 247 and 1690 over the past three years the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any director andor officer of the company who is also a director andor officer of clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate business opportunity a “corporate opportunity” for both us and clear channel we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel unless such opportunity is offered to a director andor officer of the company in writing solely in such person’s capacity as a director andor officer of the company we have obtained a waiver of this provision to the extent it might apply to irving azoff who is our executive chairman and is also a member of clear channel’s board of directors clear channel will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

  

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline as of december 31 2011 there were 1895 million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including 33 million shares of unvested restricted stock awards and excluding 06 million shares held in treasury 07 million shares issuable from unvested restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards 123 million shares of common stock issuable from options currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of 1471 per share 81 million shares issuable from the conversion of our 2875 convertible notes and a warrant to purchase 05 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1373 

we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of our 2875 convertible notes 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

  

risks relating to the separation 

if the separation were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with the separation clear channel received both a private letter ruling from the irs and a legal opinion substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualified as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the irs were successful in taking this position clear channel could be subject to a significant united states federal income tax liability in general clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the separation otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the separation were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 

although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 9—relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel for a more detailed discussion of the tax matters agreement between clear channel and us 

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 

each member of the clear channel consolidated group which includes clear channel us and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel were unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 9—relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel 

risks relating to the spinoff from iac 

if the spinoff of ticketmaster from iac or one or more of the spincos were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos iac received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the qualification of these spinoffs as transactions that are generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos is referred to collectively as the iac spinoffs iac also received an opinion of counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that were not covered by the private letter ruling notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling and opinion of counsel the irs could determine that one or more of the iac spinoffs should be treated as a taxable distribution if it determines that any of the representations statements or assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs private letter ruling are false 

  

or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the irs ruling in addition if any of the representations statements or assumptions upon which the opinion of counsel was based were or become inaccurate the opinion may be invalid 

if any of the iac spinoffs were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes then iac would incur material income tax liabilities for which we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable under applicable federal income tax rules ticketmaster is severally liable for any federal income taxes imposed on iac with respect to taxable periods during which ticketmaster was a member of iac’s consolidated federal income tax return group including the period in which the iac spinoffs were consummated under the tax sharing agreement that ticketmaster entered into with iac and the other spincos ticketmaster generally is required to indemnify iac and the other spincos for any taxes resulting from the spinoff to the extent such amounts resulted from i any act or failure to act by ticketmaster described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement ii any acquisition of equity securities or assets of ticketmaster or iii any breach by ticketmaster of any representation or covenant contained in the spinoff documents or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor tax opinions corresponding indemnification provisions also apply to the other spincos ticketmaster is entitled to indemnification from iac among other things if ticketmaster is liable for or otherwise required to make a payment in respect of a spinoff tax liability for which ticketmaster is not responsible under the tax sharing agreement and if applicable is unable to collect from the spinco responsible for such liability under the tax sharing agreement ticketmaster’s ability to collect under these indemnity provisions would depend on the financial position of the indemnifying party 

certain transactions in iac ticketmaster or other spinco equity securities could cause one or more of the iac spinoffs to be taxable to iac and may give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

current united states federal income tax law creates a presumption that any of the iac spinoffs would be taxable to iac if it is part of a “plan or series of related transactions” pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in iac or a spinco including ticketmaster acquisitions that occur during the fouryear period that begins two years before the date of a spinoff are presumed to occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions unless it is established that the acquisition is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions that includes the spinoff 

these rules limited ticketmaster’s ability during the twoyear period following the spinoff to enter into certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to us and our stockholders particularly issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs repurchasing equity securities and under certain circumstances acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities or agreeing to be acquired under the tax sharing agreement there were restrictions on ticketmaster’s ability to take such actions for a period of 25 months from the day after the date of the spinoff entering into the merger agreement with live nation did not violate these restrictions because prior to entering into the agreement ticketmaster provided iac with an unqualified opinion of tax counsel contemplated by the tax sharing agreement and iac confirmed that the opinion was satisfactory to iac we believe that we did not take any actions during the twoyear period following the spinoff that compromised the taxfree nature of that transaction however the statutes of limitations related to these tax periods remain open and if taxing authorities successfully assert tax claims against iac related to the spinoff it could give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

in addition to actions of iac and the spincos including ticketmaster certain transactions that are outside their control and therefore not subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the tax sharing agreement such as a sale or disposition of the stock of iac or the stock of a spinco by certain persons that own five percent or more of any class of stock of iac or a spinco could have a similar effect on the taxfree status of a spinoff as transactions to which iac or a spinco is a party 

as a result of these rules even if each iac spinoff otherwise qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes transactions involving spinco or iac equity securities including transactions by certain significant stockholders could cause iac to recognize taxable gain with respect to the stock of the spinco as described above although the restrictive covenants and indemnification provisions contained in the tax sharing agreement are intended to minimize the likelihood that such an event will occur one or more of the iac spinoffs may become taxable to iac as a result of transactions in iac or spinco equity securities as discussed previously we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable for such taxes under the tax sharing agreement or under applicable federal income tax rules 

  

in connection with the merger ticketmaster received i two unqualified opinions of tax counsel one dated as of the date of execution of the definitive merger agreement and one dated as of the closing date of the merger that the transaction as contemplated in the definitive merger agreement would not have an adverse tax effect on the spinoff and ii iac’s written acknowledgement that the closing date opinion was in form and substance satisfactory to iac however the irs may disagree with the conclusions in these opinions of counsel and determine that the merger caused the spinoff to be taxable to iac were this to occur and that position were sustained we as successorininterest to ticketmaster would be required to make material indemnification payments to iac 

risks relating to the merger 

in connection with the merger we became subject to a final judgment imposing certain obligations and restrictions on us which could negatively impact our business 

on july 30 2010 the united states district court for the district of columbia approved and entered a final judgment relating to the merger that imposes certain obligations on us in order to address the issues the doj raised in its antitrust review of the merger among other things the final judgment required us to offer a license to the ticketmaster ticketing technology to aeg and to divest ticketmaster’s paciolan ticketing business we have entered into a license agreement with aeg and sold paciolan to comcastspectacor lp thus satisfying those two requirements prospectively pursuant to the final judgment we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the final judgment the final judgment is in effect and will bind us until july 30 2020 

during the duration of the final judgment we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order our compliance with the final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

also on january 25 2010 we entered into a consent agreement with the canadian competition commission or the canadian consent agreement which had the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the final judgment on our business in canada the canadian consent agreement will remain in effect for ten years following the date of the agreement the canadian consent agreement creates similar risks for us both in terms of creating potential enforcement actions and in limiting us from pursuing certain business practices

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend cts arbitration 

live nation worldwide inc or live nation worldwide and cts were parties to an agreement or the cts agreement pursuant to which cts was to develop and live nation worldwide licensed or agreed to use ticketing software or ticketing platforms under the agreement cts was to develop software to be licensed to live nation worldwide to provide ticketing services in the united states and canada the cts agreement also generally 

  

required live nation worldwide to use cts’s ticketing platforms in certain european countries so long as cts’s existing platforms were appropriately modified to meet local market conditions in june 2010 live nation worldwide terminated the cts agreement because cts materially breached the agreement by failing to deliver a north american ticketing system that met the contractual requirements of being a “world class ticketing system    that fits the needs of the north american market” and by failing to deliver a ticketing system for the united kingdom and other european countries that fit the needs of those markets as required by the cts agreement 

for north america had cts performed on the cts agreement it would have been generally entitled to receive during the then 10year term of the cts agreement a per ticket license fee upon the sale of certain tickets that live nation worldwide or any of certain of its subsidiaries which are collectively referred to as the live nation worldwide entities controlled and had the right to distribute by virtue of certain promotion and venue management relations this per ticket fee for events in north america was payable to cts regardless of whether the live nation worldwide entities chose to use the cts ticketing platform ticketmaster’s ticketing platform or another ticketing platform for the sale of such controlled tickets for events in certain european countries not including the united kingdom live nation worldwide generally was required during a 10year term to exclusively book on the cts ticketing platform all tickets that the live nation worldwide entities had the right to distribute or to the extent other ticketing platforms were used live nation worldwide was generally required to pay to cts the same fee that would have been payable had the cts platform been used for events in the united kingdom live nation worldwide was required for a 10year term to i book on the cts ticketing platform all tickets controlled by live nation worldwide entities that are not allocated by live nation worldwide for sale through other sales channels and ii to offer for sale on the cts uk website a portion of the tickets controlled by the live nation worldwide entities finally the cts agreement obligated live nation worldwide and cts to negotiate a set of noncompete agreements that subject to legal restrictions could have precluded live nation worldwide from offering primary market ticketing services to third parties in certain european countries during the term of the cts agreement 

in april 2010 cts filed a request for arbitration with the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce or icc pursuant to the cts agreement in its request for arbitration cts asserts among other things that i the terms of the cts agreement including the north america per ticket license fee european exclusivity obligations and united kingdom distribution obligations described above apply to tickets sold and distributed by ticketmaster ii ticketmaster’s sales and distribution of tickets following the completion of the merger have resulted in various breaches of live nation worldwide’s obligations under the cts agreement iii live nation has failed to allocate the proper number of tickets to cts’s system in the united kingdom and iv the merger and our subsequent actions have breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its request for arbitration cts seeks relief in the form of a declaration that live nation and live nation worldwide are in breach of the cts agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing specific performance of live nation worldwide’s obligations under the cts agreement and unspecified damages resulting from such breaches in march 2011 cts provided further specifications on its claims and purported damages including a claim for royalties that would have been paid over the contemplated 10year term of the cts agreement and on ticketmastercontrolled tickets as well as tickets controlled by live nation worldwide or any of certain of its subsidiaries 

in may 2010 we responded to cts’s request for arbitration and filed counterclaims asserting that cts breached the cts agreement by failing to provide ticketing platforms that met the standard required by the cts agreement for the north american and european markets we are seeking relief primarily in the form of damages and a declaration that we validly terminated the cts agreement based on cts’s material breaches we deny that cts is entitled to collect damages for royalties that would have been paid over the full 10year term of the cts agreement or on ticketmastercontrolled tickets the matter has been assigned to an arbitrator and hearings were conducted in the summer and fall of 2011 a decision from the arbitrator is currently expected in the first half of 2012 while we do not believe that a loss is probable of occurring at this time if the arbitrator rules against us on any or all claims the amounts at stake could be substantial considerable uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the claims and damages asserted against us as a result we are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for this matter we intend to continue to vigorously defend the action 

live concert antitrust litigation 

we were a defendant in a lawsuit filed by malinda heerwagen in june 2002 in united states district court the plaintiff on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain concert ticket purchasers alleged that anticompetitive practices for concert promotion services by us nationwide caused artificially high ticket prices in august 2003 the district court ruled in our favor denying the plaintiff’s class certification motion the plaintiff appealed to the united states court of appeals in january 2006 the court of appeals affirmed and the plaintiff 

  

then dismissed her action that same month subsequently twentytwo putative class actions were filed by different named plaintiffs in various united states district courts throughout the country making claims substantially similar to those made in the heerwagen action except that the geographic markets alleged are regional statewide or more local in nature and the members of the putative classes are limited to individuals who purchased tickets to concerts in the relevant geographic markets alleged the plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory punitive and treble damages declaratory and injunctive relief and costs of suit including attorneys’ fees we have filed our answers in some of these actions and have denied liability in april 2006 granting our motion the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred these actions to the united states district court for the central district of california for coordinated pretrial proceedings in june 2007 the district court conducted a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and also that month the court entered an order to stay all proceedings pending the court’s ruling on class certification in october 2007 the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion and certified classes in the chicago new england new yorknew jersey colorado and southern california regional markets in november 2007 the court extended its stay of all proceedings pending further developments in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in february 2008 we filed with the district court a motion for reconsideration of its october 2007 class certification order in october 2010 the district court denied our motion for reconsideration and lifted the stay of all proceedings in february 2011 we filed with the district court a motion for partial summary judgment regarding statute of limitations in april 2011 the district court granted our motion for partial summary judgment in november 2011 we filed with the district court our motion for class decertification motion to exclude testimony of the plaintiffs’ expert witness and motions for summary judgment in the actions pertaining to the colorado and southern california regional markets trial of the action involving the southern california regional market is currently scheduled for april 2012 in the district court in february 2012 we participated in a courtordered settlement mediation with plaintiffs’ counsel with respect to two of the regional cases no settlement was reached and the mediation is scheduled to resume in april 2012 while we do not believe that a loss is probable of occurring at this time if any or all of the cases proceed to trial and plaintiffs are awarded damages the amount of any such award could be substantial considerable uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the claims and damages asserted against us as a result we are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for this matter we intend to continue to vigorously defend all claims in all of the actions 

ticketing fees consumer class action litigation 

in october 2003 a putative representative action was filed in the superior court of california challenging ticketmaster’s charges to online customers for shipping fees and alleging that its failure to disclose on its website that the charges contain a profit component is unlawful the complaint asserted a claim for violation of california’s unfair competition law or ucl and sought restitution or disgorgement of the difference between i the total shipping fees charged by ticketmaster in connection with online ticket sales during the applicable period and ii the amount that ticketmaster actually paid to the shipper for delivery of those tickets in august 2005 the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint then pleading the case as a putative class action and adding the claim that ticketmaster’s website disclosures in respect of its ticket order processing fees constitute false advertising in violation of california’s false advertising law on this new claim the amended complaint seeks restitution or disgorgement of the entire amount of order processing fees charged by ticketmaster during the applicable period in april 2009 the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file a second amended complaint adding new claims that a ticketmaster’s order processing fees are unconscionable under the ucl and b ticketmaster’s alleged business practices further violate the california consumer legal remedies act plaintiffs later filed a third amended complaint to which ticketmaster filed a demurrer in july 2009 the court overruled ticketmaster’s demurrer in october 2009 

the plaintiffs filed a class certification motion in august 2009 which ticketmaster opposed in february 2010 the court granted certification of a class on the first and second causes of action which allege that ticketmaster misrepresentsomits the fact of a profit component in our shipping and order processing fees the class would consist of california consumers who purchased tickets through ticketmaster’s website from 1999 to present the court denied certification of a class on the third and fourth causes of action which allege that ticketmaster’s shipping and order processing fees are unconscionably high in march 2010 ticketmaster filed a petition for writ of mandate with the california court of appeal and plaintiffs also filed a motion for reconsideration of the superior court’s class certification order in april 2010 the superior court denied plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the court’s class certification order and the court of appeal denied ticketmaster’s petition for writ of mandate in june 2010 the court of appeal granted the plaintiffs’ petition for writ of mandate and ordered the superior court to vacate its february 2010 order denying plaintiffs’ motion to certify a national class and enter a new order granting plaintiffs’ motion to certify a nationwide class on the first and second claims in september 2010 ticketmaster filed its motion for summary judgment on all causes of action in the superior court and that same month plaintiffs filed their motion for summary adjudication of various affirmative defenses asserted by ticketmaster in november 2010 ticketmaster filed their motion to decertify class 

  

in december 2010 the parties entered into a binding term sheet that provided for the settlement of the litigation and the resolution of all claims therein the settlement was memorialized in a longform agreement in april 2011 in june 2011 after a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of the settlement the court declined to approve the settlement reached by the parties in its thencurrent form litigation continued and on september 2 2011 the court granted in part and denied in part ticketmaster’s motion for summary judgment the parties reached a new settlement on september 2 2011 and subsequently entered into a longform agreement the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the new settlement on september 27 2011 in october 2011 the court preliminarily approved the new settlement ticketmaster has notified all class members of the settlement and a hearing on final approval of the settlement is scheduled for may 2012 ticketmaster and its parent live nation have not acknowledged any violations of law or liability in connection with the matter but agreed to the settlement in order to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further protracted litigation 

as of december 31 2011 we have accrued 358 million our best estimate of the probable costs associated with the settlement referred to above this liability includes an estimated redemption rate any difference between our estimated redemption rate and the actual redemption rate we experience will impact the final settlement amount however we do not expect this difference to be material 

canadian consumer class action litigation relating to ticketsnow 

in february 2009 five putative consumer class action complaints were filed in various provinces of canada against ticketsnow ticketmaster ticketmaster canada ltd and premium inventory inc all of the cases allege essentially the same set of facts and causes of action each plaintiff purports to represent a class consisting of all persons who purchased a ticket from ticketmaster ticketmaster canada ltd or ticketsnow from february 2007 to present and alleges that ticketmaster conspired to divert a large number of tickets for resale through the ticketsnow website at prices higher than face value the plaintiffs characterize these actions as being in violation of ontario’s ticket speculation act the amusement act of manitoba the amusement act of alberta or the quebec consumer protection act the ontario case contains the additional allegation that ticketmaster’s and ticketsnow’s service fees run afoul of antiscalping laws each lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of the class 

as of december 31 2011 we have accrued our best estimate of the probable costs associated with the resale market claims of this matter the full amount of which was funded by an escrow established in connection with ticketmaster’s 2008 acquisition of ticketsnow 

in february 2012 the parties entered into a settlement agreement that would if approved by the courts resolve all of the resale market claims the court approval process for the proposed settlement has been commenced with a motion for preapproval having been filed in ontario and is expected to take several months we estimate that the total cost of the settlement will be within the amount that has been accrued 

while it is reasonably possible that a loss related to the primary market claims of this matter could be incurred by us in a future period we do not believe that a loss is probable of occurring at this time considerable uncertainty remains regarding the validity of the claims and damages asserted against us as a result we are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for the primary market claims of this matter we intend to continue to vigorously defend all claims in all of the actions 

united states consumer class action litigation relating to ticketsnow 

from february through june 2009 eleven putative class action lawsuits asserting causes of action under various state consumer protection laws were filed against ticketmaster and ticketsnow in united states district courts in california new jersey minnesota pennsylvania and north carolina the lawsuits allege that ticketmaster and ticketsnow unlawfully deceived consumers by among other things selling large quantities of tickets to ticketsnow’s ticket brokers either prior to or at the time that tickets for an event go on sale thereby forcing consumers to purchase tickets at significantly markedup prices on ticketsnowcom instead of ticketmastercom the plaintiffs further claim violation of the consumer protection laws by ticketmaster’s alleged “redirecting” of consumers from ticketmastercom to ticketsnowcom thereby engaging in false advertising and an unfair business practice by deceiving consumers into inadvertently purchasing tickets from ticketsnow for amounts greater than face value the plaintiffs claim that ticketmaster has been unjustly enriched by this conduct and seek compensatory damages a refund to every class member of the difference between tickets’ face value and the amount paid to ticketsnow an injunction preventing ticketmaster from engaging in further unfair business practices with ticketsnow and attorneys’ fees and costs in july 2009 all of the cases were consolidated and transferred to the united states district court for the central district of california the plaintiffs filed their consolidated class action complaint in september 2009 to which ticketmaster filed its answer the following month in july 2010

other litigation 

from time to time we are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business including proceedings and claims based upon violations of antitrust laws and tortious interference which could cause us to incur significant expenses we have also been the subject of personal injury and wrongful death claims relating to accidents at our venues in connection with our operations as required we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or other losses for the resolution of any outstanding claims these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results including in some cases estimated redemption rates for the settlement offered assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings in addition under our agreements with clear channel we have assumed and will indemnify clear channel for liabilities related to our business for which they are a party in the defense 

as of december 31 2011 we have accrued 440 million for the specific cases discussed above as our best estimate of the probable costs of legal settlement including 358 million for the ticketing fees consumer class action litigation settlement

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections about our industry business and future financial results our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those discussed under 1a—risk factors and other sections in this annual report 

executive overview 

in 2011 we saw ticket sales grow and the overall business improved and delivered growth in both revenue and operating results our strategy remains centered on expanding our presence in the world’s largest live entertainment markets leveraging our leadership position in the live entertainment industry to sell more tickets and grow our sponsorship and advertising revenue while continuing to optimize our cost structure we believe as the leading global live event and ticketing company that we are wellpositioned to better serve artists teams fans and venues

sponsorship revenue increased 180 million or 11 during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the prior year excluding the increase of 49 million related to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates revenue increased 131 million or 8 primarily due to new sponsorship agreements renewal or expansion of existing arrangements marketing fees and expansion of our sponsorship operations

although there was no significant change in revenue sponsorship direct operating expenses decreased 166 million or 37 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher fees paid to artists related to tour sponsorship agreements in 2009 excluding the expense relating to artist tour sponsorships direct operating and selling general and administrative expenses in total decreased 13 million during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the prior year in 2010 we have changed the pay structures of many of our sponsorship sales force from a commission structure to a salary plus bonus structure to properly align sales incentives with the overall growth drivers and goals of the company this has caused a decrease in direct operating expenses and an increase in selling general and administrative expenses 

overall sponsorship operating income increased 116 million or 12 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the prior year primarily driven by higher international festival sponsorships 

  

reconciliation of segment operating income loss 

 

 reconciliation of segment adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration arrangements merger bonuses payments under the azoff trust note and acquisitionrelated severance depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment loss gain on sale of operating assets and noncash and certain stockbased compensation expense including expense associated with grants of certain stockbased awards which are classified as liabilities  we use aoi to evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

  

the following table sets forth the computation of adjusted operating income loss 

 

   

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is currently centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements and capital expenditures while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

our balance sheets reflect cash and cash equivalents of 8443 million at december 31 2011 and 8928 million at december 31 2010 included in the december 31 2011 and 2010 cash and cash equivalents balance is 3739 million and 3845 million respectively of funds representing amounts equal to the face value of tickets sold on behalf of clients and the clients’ share of convenience and order processing charges or client funds we do not utilize client funds for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients our balance sheets reflect current and longterm debt of 1716 billion at december 31 2011 and 1732 billion at december 31 2010 our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the debt discounts on our term loan and convertible notes and the debt premium on our 1075 senior notes was 60 at december 31 2011 

our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is in interestbearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds  while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned andor operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client funds less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and for cash collected on behalf of others for ticket sales plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate hedge agreements consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default 

  

sources of cash 

liberty media subscription agreement 

in february 2011 we entered into a subscription agreement with liberty media pursuant to the subscription agreement in february and june 2011 we sold to liberty media 18 million and 55 million shares respectively of our common stock for cash consideration of 188 million and 577 million respectively 

may 2010 senior secured credit facility

debt covenants 

our senior secured credit facility which was entered into in may 2010 contains a number of covenants and restrictions that among other things requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants and restricts our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt make certain investments and acquisitions repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness create liens enter into agreements with affiliates modify the nature of our business enter into saleleaseback transactions transfer and sell material assets merge or consolidate and pay dividends and make distributions with the exception of subsidiary dividends or distributions to the parent company or other subsidiaries on at least a prorata basis with any noncontrolling interest partners noncompliance with one or more of the covenants and restrictions could result in the full or partial principal balance of the credit facility becoming immediately due and payable the senior secured credit facility agreement has two covenants measured quarterly that relate to total leverage and interest coverage the consolidated total leverage covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda both as defined in the credit agreement of 45x over the trailing four consecutive quarters the total leverage ratio will reduce to 40x on september 30 2012 375x on september 30 2013 and 35x on march 31 2015 the consolidated interest coverage covenant requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense both as defined in the credit agreement of 275x over the trailing four consecutive quarters the interest coverage ratio will increase to 30x on september 30 2012 

the indentures governing our 1075 senior notes and the 8125 senior notes contain covenants that limit among other things our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock make certain distributions investments and other restricted payments sell certain assets agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us merge consolidate or sell all of our assets create certain liens and engage in transactions with affiliates on terms that are not arm’s length certain covenants including those pertaining to incurrence of indebtedness restricted payments asset sales mergers and transactions with affiliates will be suspended during any period in which the notes are rated investment grade by both rating agencies and no default or event of default under the indentures has occurred and is continuing the 1075 senior notes and the 8125 senior notes each contain two incurrencebased financial covenants as defined requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 to 10 and a maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio of 275 to 10

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions the acquired entity may have cash on its balance sheet at the time of acquisition all amounts discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2011 we used 395 million in cash primarily for the acquisitions in our artist nation segment of interests in four artist management companies in the united kingdom and the united states the april 2011 acquisition in our ticketing segment of serviticket the october 2011 acquisition in our artist nation segment of tshirt printers the december 2011 acquisition in our concerts segment of lnhs concerts and the december 2011 acquisition in our ecommerce segment of bigchampagne 

  

during 2010 our cash increased by 4915 million from acquisitions in our concerts ticketing artist nation and ecommerce segments primarily related to cash on hand in our merger with ticketmaster partially offset by our acquisition of ticketnet a ticketing company in france 

during 2009 we used 97 million in cash for acquisitions in our concerts segment primarily related to our acquisitions of tecjet a company that holds the lease for a venue in scotland brand new live bv a concert promotion company in the netherlands and parcolimpico which manages facilities and venues in turin italy 

purchases of intangibles 

in 2011 and 2010 we used 26 million and 18 million respectively in cash primarily related to a naming rights agreement for a holland music event in 2009 we used 279 million in cash primarily related to certain artist rights agreements entered into in 2008 

capital expenditures 

venue and ticketing operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing system to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and information systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network or the development of new online or ticketing tools or technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to add revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords or replacements funded by insurance companies consisted of the following 

 

 maintenance capital expenditures for 2011 increased from the prior year primarily due to expenditures relating to the integration of our financial systems and offices as a result of the merger along with timing of maintenance expenditures related to venues ticketing technology and client ticketing equipment 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2011 increased from the prior year primarily related to the replatforming of our ticketing system and website enhancements 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2010 increased from the prior year primarily due to expenditures for our ticketing systems as part of the merger 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2010 primarily related to ticketing system and website enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures for 2010 decreased from the prior year primarily due to the 2009 development and renovation of various venues including a house of blues club in boston the gibson amphitheater in california and the amg venue expansion in birmingham 

we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately 125 million for the year ending december 31 2012 

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and some of the venues used in our concert operations under 

  

longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditure commitments as of december 31 2011 are as follows 

 

  

 

  

 during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 247 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2012 through 2016 are 16 million each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business we entered into an assumption agreement with the buyer in connection with the sale under which the buyer is assuming our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2011 

aggregate minimum rentals of 799 million to be received in years 2012 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 131 million and 32 million for each of the respective periods primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tourrelated credit cards and guarantees of bank lines of credit of a nonconsolidated affiliate and a thirdparty promoter 

  

cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

year ended 2011 compared to year ended 2010 

cash provided by operations was 1357 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 1585 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 228 million decrease in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from the net changes in the operating balance sheet accounts largely offset by the increase in the cashrelated portion of net income in 2011 we received less deferred revenue and increased accounts receivable and other assets partially offset by lower prepaid expenses as compared to the prior year also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operations was 222 million in payments related to the 2011 acquisition of certain of the remaining equity interests in front line that were classified as liabilities 

year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009 

cash provided by operations was 1585 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 573 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 1012 million increase in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from the increase in the cashrelated portion of net income 

investing activities 

year ended 2011 compared to year ended 2010 

cash used in investing activities was 1520 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 4530 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 6050 million increase in cash used by investing activities is primarily due to 5765 million of cash acquired in the merger in 2010 fewer disposals of assets and an increase in purchases of property plant and equipment 

year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009 

cash provided by investing activities was 4530 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 775 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 3755 million increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to cash acquired in the merger partially offset by higher proceeds received in 2009 from the disposal of operating assets 

financing activities 

year ended 2011 compared to year ended 2010 

cash used in financing activities was 444 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 491 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the 935 million increase in cash used by financing activities is primarily a result of net proceeds received in 2010 from the issuance of 250 million of 8125 senior notes and our new senior secured credit facility after repayment of the borrowings under the live nation and ticketmaster credit facilities payment of debt issuance costs as well as the redemption of preferred stock as compared to only a net paydown in 2011 on the new term loans the increase was also a result of cash used for purchases of noncontrolling interests primarily related to the 2011 acquisition of the remaining equity interests in front line these increases were partially offset by proceeds received in 2011 from the sale of common stock in connection with the subscription agreement with liberty media 

year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009 

cash provided by financing activities was 491 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to cash used in financing activities of 1244 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 1735 million 

  

increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of net proceeds received in 2010 from the issuance of 250 million of 8125 senior notes and our new senior secured credit facility after repayment of the borrowings under the live nation and ticketmaster credit facilities payment of debt issuance costs as well as the redemption of preferred stock as compared to an overall net paydown in the prior year resulting primarily from a paydown on our term loan from asset sale proceeds 

seasonality 

our concerts and artist nation segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and international festivals are primarily used or occur during may through september and our artists touring activity is higher in addition the timing of the onsale of tickets and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a—risk factors our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 1195 million for the year ended december 31 2011 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2011 by 120 million as of december 31 2011 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with shortterm artist fee commitments we also enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on forecasted operating income at december 31 2011 we had forward currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of 325 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 1716 billion of total debt net of unamortized discounts and premiums outstanding as of december 31 2011 of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we had 9250 million of fixedrate debt and 7907 million of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2011 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 20 million when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2011 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

  

at december 31 2011 we have one interest rate cap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes the interest rate cap had a notional amount of 875 million at december 31 2011 to limit our cash flow exposure to an interest rate of 4 per annum this agreement expires on june 30 2013 the fair value of this agreement at december 31 2011 was a de minimis asset this agreement was put in place to reduce the variability of a portion of the cash flows from the interest payments related to the may 2010 senior secured credit facility the terms of the may 2010 senior secured credit facility require one or more interest rate protection agreements with an effect of fixing or limiting the interest costs for at least 50 of the consolidated total funded debt at the closing date for at least three years upon the execution of this interest rate cap agreement the existing interest rate protection agreements fully met this requirement 

through our amg subsidiary we have two interest rate swap agreements with a 321 million aggregate notional amount that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis both agreements expire in december 2015 also in connection with the financing of the redevelopment of the o 2 dublin we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 114 million that expires in december 2013 effectively converting a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

we currently have 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 with a principal amount of 2200 million beginning with the period commencing on july 20 2014 and ending on january 14 2015 and for each of the interest periods commencing thereafter we will pay contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120 of the principal amount of the notes the contingent interest payable per note will equal 025 per year of the average trading price of such note during the applicable five tradingday reference period payable in arrears 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted pronouncements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements which requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices this guidance eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires allocation using the relativesellingprice method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables we adopted this guidance on january 1 2011 and are applying it prospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2010 the fasb issued guidance on disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations which amends and requires additional pro forma disclosure requirements for material business combinations on an individual or aggregate basis including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as if the acquisition dates had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period this guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure requirements to include a description of the nature and amount of any material nonrecurring adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination we adopted this guidance and are applying it prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after january 1 2011 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements the new guidance eliminates the presentation option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb deferred indefinitely the effective date for a portion of this guidance relating to the presentation of reclassification adjustments the remainder of this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption of the new guidance is permitted and full retrospective application is required we have adopted all parts of this guidance that were not deferred as of december 31 2011 

in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance which gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and in some cases bypass the twostep impairment test this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 early adoption of the new guidance is permitted we adopted this guidance on october 1 2011 

  

recently issued pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued guidance that improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements this guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including 1 the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts 2 measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity’s stockholders’ equity and 3 quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level 3 it also requires additional disclosure for level 3 measurements regarding the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs the amendments in this guidance are to be applied prospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 we will adopt this guidance on january 1 2012 and the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

consolidation 

intercompany accounts among the consolidated businesses have been eliminated in consolidation net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected in the statements of operations for consolidated affiliates we consolidate entities in which we own more than 50 of the voting common stock and control operations and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20 of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20 of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

business combinations 

we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value additionally contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and classified as a liability goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree exceeds the recognized bases of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates and asset lives among other items 

  

property plant and equipment 

we test for possible impairment of property plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances change such as a significant reduction in operating cash flow or a dramatic change in the manner that the asset is intended to be used indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if indicators exist we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets to the carrying amount of those assets if the carrying value is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

intangibles 

we test for possible impairment of definitelived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances change such as a significant reduction in operating cash flow or a dramatic change in the manner in which the asset is intended to be used which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we test for possible impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value when specific asset carrying values are determined to be less than the fair value the carrying value of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these definitelived and indefinitelived assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

we review goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a threestep process the first step is a qualitative evaluation as to whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units are less than its carrying value using an assessment of relevant events and circumstances examples of such events and circumstances include financial performance industry and market conditions macroeconomic conditions reporting unitspecific events historical results of goodwill impairment testing and the timing of the last performance of step two if any reporting units are concluded to be more likely impaired than not a second step is performed for that reporting unit this second step used to quantitatively screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the third step employed for any reporting unit that fails step two is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

the second and third steps that we use to evaluate goodwill for impairment involve the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

  

in developing fair values for our reporting units we may employ a market multiple or a discounted cash flow methodology the market multiple methodology compares us to similar companies on the basis of risk characteristics to determine its risk profile relative to the comparable companies as a group this analysis generally focuses on quantitative considerations which include financial performance and other quantifiable data and qualitative considerations which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance the most significant assumptions affecting the market multiple methodology are the market multiples and control premium a control premium represents the value an investor would pay above noncontrolling interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the respective company 

the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows the discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate the terminal value or attrition rate and expected future revenue and operating margins which vary among reporting units 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the performance occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned andor operated venues in the united states and where we control the tickets internationally this revenue is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue for these ticket fees collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs these fees will be shared between our ticketing segment and our concerts segment for tickets sold for events for thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

for multiple element contracts we allocate consideration to the multiple elements based on the relative fair selling price of each separate element which are determined using vendor specific objective evidence thirdparty evidence or our best estimate in order to assign relative fair values 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction of revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

stockbased compensation 

we follow the fair value recognition provisions of the fasb guidance for stock compensation in accordance with the fasb guidance for stock compensation we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates noncash compensation expense could be materially impacted 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on those foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

  

 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues prior period calculations have been revised to conform to the current period presentation

our industry 

we operate in four main industries within the live entertainment business including live music events ticketing software and services artist management and artist services and venue operations 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production of music tours typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with performers to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets performers are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances promoters in conjunction with performers managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise sponsorships parking and premium seats for the events they host venue operators typically receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as well as percentages of total concession sales from the concessionaire and percentages of total merchandise sales from the merchandisers 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology on these box office tickets the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting their fee as ticket purchases increase related ticketing operating income generally increases as well 

ticketing “resale” services refers to the sale of tickets by a holder who originally purchased the tickets from a venue promoter or other entity or a ticketing services provider selling on behalf of a venue promoter or other entity generally the ticket reseller is paid a service charge when the ticket is resold and the negotiated ticket value is paid to the holder 

artist services primarily provides management services to music recording artists in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists the artist manager negotiates on behalf of the artist and is paid a fee generally as a percentage of the artist’s earnings artist services also sells merchandise associated with musical artists at live musical performances to retailers and directly to consumers via the internet and also sells premium ticket packages artist services is highly seasonal with profitability related to the timing of tours and merchandise sales peak seasons are typically in the summer and in the fall leading up to the holiday season 

the sponsorship and advertising industry within the live entertainment business involves the sale of international national regional and local advertising campaigns and promotional programs to a variety of companies desiring to advertise or promote their brand or product the advertising campaigns typically include venue naming rights onsite venue signage online banner advertisements and exclusive partner rights in various categories such as beverage hotel and telecommunications the promotional programs typically include event presales and product onsite activation 

our business 

we operate in five reportable business segments concerts ticketing artist nation ecommerce and sponsorship prior to 2010 our reportable operating segments were north american music international music and ticketing the artist nation segment is primarily made up of front line’s artist management and services businesses and our artist services 

  

business which was previously reported as a component of the north american music segment information related to these operating segments and other operations for 2010 2009 and 2008 is included in note 18—segment data in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

concerts our concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals across the world during 2010 our concerts business generated approximately 34 billion or 676 of our total revenue we promoted over 21000 live music events in 2010 including artists such as u2 roger waters and lady gaga and through festivals such as rock werchter reading and download while our concerts segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and international festivals which primarily occur may through september 

as a promoter we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own andor operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenue is generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we generate revenue primarily from the sale of food and beverages parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations for events we promote at our venues or by third parties under ticketing agreements in our amphitheaters the sale of food and beverages is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

as a festival operator we typically book performers secure festival sites provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract audiences we also arrange for thirdparties to provide operational services as needed such as concessions merchandising and security we earn revenue from the sale of tickets and typically pay performers a fixed guaranteed amount we also earn revenue from the sale of food and beverages camping fees festival sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold for each event we either use a festival site we own or rent a thirdparty festival site revenue is generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in festival promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

ticketing  our ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of our clients and retains a convenience charge and order processing fee for our services we sell tickets for our events and also for thirdparty clients including venues promoters sports leagues and teams and museum and cultural institutions across multiple live event categories providing exclusive ticketing services for leading arenas stadiums amphitheaters music clubs concert promoters professional sports franchises and leagues college sports teams performing arts venues museums and theaters we sell tickets through a combination of websites ticket outlets and telephone services during the year ended december 31 2010 we sold 7615 and 9 of primary tickets through these channels respectively during 2010 our ticketing business generated approximately 10 billion or 205 of our total revenue through all of our ticketing services we sold almost 120 million tickets in 2010 and sold an additional 112 million tickets through our venue clients’ box offices and season ticket sales 

our ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which may vary depending upon event scheduling by our clients generally the first and second quarters of the year experience the highest domestic ticketing revenue earned primarily in the concerts and sports categories international revenue is generally the highest in the fourth quarter of the year earned primarily in the concerts category 

we generally enter into written agreements with individual clients to provide primary ticketing services for specified multiyear periods typically ranging from three to five years pursuant to these agreements clients generally determine what tickets will be available for sale when such tickets will go on sale to the public and what the ticket face price will be agreements with venue clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented at the relevant venue for which tickets are made available to the general public agreements with promoter clients generally grant us the right to sell tickets for all events presented by a given promoter at any venue unless that venue is already covered by an existing exclusive agreement with our ticketing business or another ticketing service provider under our 

  

exclusive contracts clients may not utilize authorize or promote the services of thirdparty ticketing companies or technologies while under contract with us while we generally have the right to sell a substantial portion of our clients’ tickets venue and promoter clients often sell and distribute group sales and season tickets inhouse in addition under many written agreements between promoters and our clients the client often allocates certain tickets for artist promoter agent and venue use and do not make those tickets available for sale by us we also generally allow clients to make a certain limited number of tickets available for sale through fan clubs or other similar clubs from which we generally derive no revenue unless selected by the club to facilitate the sales as a result we do not sell all of our clients’ tickets and the amount of tickets that we sell varies from client to client and from event to event and varies as to any single client from year to year

live nation venue details 

in the live entertainment industry venues generally consist of 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

venues 

at december 31 2010 we owned operated had booking rights for andor had an equity interest in the following domestic and international venues primarily used for music events 

 

   

   

   

   

   

   

  

 the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned operated had booking rights for andor had an equity interest in as of december 31 2010 

 

   

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music products sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition financial marketing service support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

our main competitors in the live music industry include aeg mlk msg entertainment and c3 presents in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe anschutz entertainment group operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and have greater financial resources which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own andor operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg and anschutz entertainment group in addition to numerous smaller regional companies in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets as well as greater financial resources in those markets 

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels as online ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites our main competitors include veritix ®  ticketscom outbox technology inc paciolan and cts eventim 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events the advent of online commerce has also contributed to the growth of resale ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts the internet has allowed fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and has provided consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors for online event sites include ticketscom as well as secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

  

in the artist management and services business we compete with other artist managers both at large talent representation companies such as caa and william morris endeavor entertainment as well as smaller artist management companies and individuals in the artist services business we compete with companies typically only involved in one or a few of the services we provide some of these competitors include bill young productions and bravado 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships include local sports teams which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages additionally our competitors locally can include festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

we are required to comply with the laws of the countries we operate in and also the us fcpa regarding antibribery regulations these regulations make it illegal for us to pay or promise to pay money or anything of value to any government official for the purpose of directly or indirectly obtaining or retaining business this ban on illegal payments and bribes also applies to agents or intermediaries who use funds for purposes prohibited by the statute 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

  

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” “ticketmaster” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation ticketmaster house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered our most significant trademarks in many foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 6500 fulltime employees including 4100 domestic and 2400 international employees of which approximately 6350 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 150 were employed in our corporate group 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees primarily for our live music venues as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 3500 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 14000 seasonal employees in 2010 the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our leverage our convertible notes our business our common stock our separation from clear channel our merger with ticketmaster and our general business operations these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks relating to our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

as of december 31 2010 our total indebtedness for borrowed money excluding unamortized debt discounts and premiums was approximately 1756 billion our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately 2507 million with outstanding letters of credit of approximately 493 million we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2010 approximately 540 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2011 573 million is due in the aggregate for 2012 and 2013 3237 million is due in the aggregate for 2014 and 2015 and 1321 billion is due thereafter in addition as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 15 billion in operating lease agreements of which approximately 1040 million is due in 2011 and 984 million is due in 2012 see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our ability to service our debt and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist advances and capital expenditures will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is to an extent subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we cannot predict the impact to our ability to access additional capital in light of the current uncertainty in the credit market if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we 

  

may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility and other future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt or lease service obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all as a result the inability to meet our debt or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our senior secured credit facility includes other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable 

these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs furthermore they may restrict our ability to expand to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations thereunder accelerated our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 

we depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

  

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring business could result in the loss of key tours 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to post a letter of credit or advance cash to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted 

risks relating to our 2875 convertible senior notes 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments which may increase note holders’ credit risk 

in july 2007 we issued 220 million of 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended on july 15 2014 july 15 2017 and july 15 2022 or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts to the repurchase date in addition at any time on or prior to june 15 2027 we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to 1000 for each 1000 in principal amount of notes converted however it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes in addition some of our existing financing agreements contain and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness could contain provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt if we do not obtain such consent or refinance the debt we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 

the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 

if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july 15 2014 we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction furthermore holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july 15 2014 or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price there will be no increase in the conversion rate in addition in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and if we so elect holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 

prior to july 15 2027 the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock as applicable for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

  

upon conversion of the notes holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 

if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock including by making a net share settlement election the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined subject to certain exceptions by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the 20 trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion or if tendered within the 20 days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases after holders of notes tender their notes for conversion the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 

the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events including but not limited to the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock or for a thirdparty tender offer 

risks relating to our business 

our business is highly sensitive to public tastes and dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we and our ticketing clients may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our business is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our live entertainment business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform live music content any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those artists do not choose to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected our ticketing business relies on third parties to create and perform live entertainment sporting and leisure events and to price tickets to such events accordingly our ticketing business’ success depends in part upon the ability of these third parties to correctly anticipate public demand for particular events as well as the availability of popular artists entertainers and teams our artist services business could be adversely affected if the artists it represents do not tour or perform as frequently as anticipated or if such tours or performances are not as widely attended by fans as anticipated due to changing tastes general economic conditions or otherwise 

in addition our live entertainment business typically books our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agrees to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any revenue therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or a performer cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as foregone revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if a performer cancels a tour but it may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business depends on relationships with key promoters executives managers artists and clients and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our business similarly the artist services business is dependent upon the highly personalized relationship between a manager and an artist and the loss of a manager may also result in a loss in the artist represented by the manager which could adversely affect our business although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals described above to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees or managers will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts 

  

the success of our ticketing business depends in significant part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with existing clients and to establish new client relationships we anticipate that for the foreseeable future the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue will be derived from both online and offline sales of tickets we also expect that revenue from primary ticketing services which consist primarily of per ticket convenience charges and per order “order processing” fees will continue to comprise the substantial majority of our ticketing segment revenue we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain existing client contracts or enter into or maintain new client contracts on acceptable terms if at all and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

another important component of our success is our ability to maintain existing and to build new relationships with thirdparty distribution channels advertisers sponsors and service providers any adverse change in these relationships including the inability of these parties to fulfill their obligations to our businesses for any reason could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist services industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue due to such competition the live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers’ discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book performers and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

our ticketing business faces significant competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new and retain existing clients on a continuous basis additionally we face significant and increasing challenges from companies that sell selfticketing systems and from clients who are increasingly choosing to selfticket through the integration of such systems into their existing operations or the acquisition of primary ticket services providers or by increasing sales through facility box offices and season subscription or group sales we also face competition in the resale of tickets from online auction websites and resale marketplaces and from other ticket resellers with online distribution capabilities the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline in 2010 we entered into an agreement with aeg which provides them the ability to license our ticketmaster ticketing technology to thirdparty clients and we divested ticketmaster’s paciolan ticketing business both of which further increase the competition that we face relatedly as a result of our merger with ticketmaster we may face direct competition in the live music industry with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of ticketing clients we have and a decline in the volume of our ticketing business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the secondary ticket sales market we have restrictions on our business that are not faced by our competitors which restrictions are both selfimposed and imposed as a result of agreements entered into with the ftc and the attorneys general of several individual states these restrictions primarily relate to our ticketsnow business and include a restriction on linking from our page on the wwwticketmastercom website that informs consumers that no tickets were found in response to their ticket request to our ticketsnow resale website without first obtaining approval from the state of new jersey as to any changes to our current ticketmasterticketsnow linking practices a restriction on using or allowing our affiliates to use domain names that among other things contain the unique names of venues sports teams or performers or contain names that are substantially similar to or are misspelled versions of same a requirement to clearly and conspicuously disclose on the ticketsnow website or any other resale website owned by us or on any primary ticketing website where a link or redirect to such a resale website is posted that it is a resale website and ticket prices often exceed the ticket’s original price and a requirement to make certain clear and conspicuous disclosures when a ticket being offered for resale is not “inhand” as well as a requirement to monitor and enforce the compliance of third parties offering tickets on our websites with such disclosure requirements our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by similar restrictions as a result our ability to effectively compete in the secondary ticket sales market through our ticketsnow business or 

  

otherwise may be adversely affected which could in turn adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the artist services industry is also a highly competitive industry there are numerous other artist management companies and individual managers in the united states alone we compete with these companies and individuals to discover new and emerging artists and to represent established acts in addition certain of our arrangements with clients of our artist services business are terminable at will by either party leading to competition to retain those artists as clients competition is intense and may contribute to a decline in the volume of our artist services business which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices and fees or profit margins include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results from continuing operations have been adversely affected by among other things reduced ticket sales event profitability overhead costs and high amortization of intangibles related to prior acquisitions live nation incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately 2038 million 1260 million and 3335 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we may face reduced demand for our live music events our ticketing software and services and other factors that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations event ticket onsales capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales and fees financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results the timing of event onsales by our ticketing clients can also impact this comparability 

  

the following table sets forth live nation’s operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 

 

 our success depends in significant part on entertainment sporting and leisure events and factors adversely affecting such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment sporting and leisure events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during past economic slowdowns and recessions many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment sporting and leisure events 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and merchandise sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any further or future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we operate in international markets in which we have limited experience and which may expose us to risks not found in doing business in the united states 

we provide services in various jurisdictions abroad through a number of brands and businesses that we own and operate as well as through joint ventures and we expect to continue to expand our international presence we face and expect to continue to face additional risks in the case of our existing and future international operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 our ability to expand our international operations into new jurisdictions or further into existing jurisdictions will depend in significant part on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates joint venture or other partners and enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms as well as our ability to make continued investments to maintain and grow existing international operations if the revenue generated by international operations are insufficient to offset expenses incurred in connection with the maintenance and growth of these operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in addition in an effort to make international operations in one or more given jurisdictions profitable over the long term significant additional investments that are not profitable over the short term could be required over a prolonged period 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2010 live nation’s international operations accounted for approximately 32 of its revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound euro and canadian dollar live nation experienced foreign exchange rate net losses of 146 million and 399 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively which had a negative effect on our operating income we experienced a foreign exchange rate net gain of 02 million in 2008 which had a positive effect on our operating income see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our growth strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities in the event of future acquisitions we could among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business in addition some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals in addition the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restricts our ability to make certain acquisitions acquisitions involve risks including those associated with 

 

   

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things expenses to pursue the acquisition and the incurrence of debt in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities also the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more unfavorable events or trends which could result in impairment charges the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may choose to substantially reduce or discontinue the operations of any of our acquired businesses if we are unsuccessful in meeting these challenges any such shutdown could expose us to expenses associated with exiting from existing contracts and terminating employees and could expose us to certain unknown liabilities that arise following the shutdown 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the ftc and the antitrust division of the doj with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in other jurisdictions also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

our businesses may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer requirements and industry standards 

the ecommerce industry is characterized by evolving industry standards frequent new service and product introductions enhancements and changing customer demands we may not be able to adapt quickly enough andor in a costeffective manner to changes in industry standards and customer requirements and preferences and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the continued widespread adoption of new internet or telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our respective services or infrastructures our failure to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures in response to these trends could render our existing websites services and proprietary technologies obsolete which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are currently in the process of rearchitecturing our ticketmaster ticketing system and migrating our international brands and businesses to a common ticketing platform in an attempt to provide consistent and stateoftheart services across our businesses and to reduce the cost and expense of maintaining multiple systems which we may not be able to complete in a timely or costeffective manner delays or difficulties in making these changes to our ticketing systems as well as any new or enhanced systems may limit our ability to achieve the desired results in a timely manner also we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or venues that we rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events causing a decrease in our revenue we have been subject to wrongful death claims and are currently subject to other litigation while we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

  

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing and ecommerce operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information technology systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent our businesses from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we lack documentation regarding certain components of our key ticketing software and systems operations and rely on certain key technology personnel to maintain such software and systems the loss of some or all of such personnel could require us to expend additional resources to continue to maintain such software and systems and could subject us to frequent systems interruptions we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in their systems and infrastructures their businesses andor third parties or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair our ability to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism other acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial conditions and results of operations 

in addition any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs litigation and other liabilities network security issues could lead to claims against us for other misuse of personal information such as for unauthorized purposes or identity theft which could result in litigation and financial liabilities as well as administrative action from governmental authorities security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers ticketing clients and other third parties it is possible that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries undetected fraud inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data as a result current security measures may not prevent any or all security breaches we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy any potential or existing security breaches and their consequences we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses andor those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

in the processing of consumer transactions we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by our respective privacy and data security policies moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storage sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by us our failure or the failure of the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation discourage potential users from trying our products and services andor result in fines andor 

  

proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents along with varying weatherrelated conditions and incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs including coverage for acts of terrorism and weatherrelated property damage we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans we also have a significant investment in information technology systems including our ticketing systems at december 31 2010 we had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 7371 million 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at reasonable costs to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues and our technology therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements to meet longterm increasing demand value and revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials equipment or workmanship required or the cost of financing such expenditures were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

  

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties 

we may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing upon intellectual property rights of third parties we regard our intellectual property rights including patents service marks trademarks and domain names copyrights trade secrets and similar intellectual property as applicable as critical to our success we also rely heavily upon software codes informational databases and other components that make up our products and services 

we rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees customers suppliers affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights despite these precautions it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secrets or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which if discovered might require legal action to correct in addition third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties 

we have generally registered and continue to apply to register or secure by contract when appropriate our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate we consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation while we vigorously protect our trademarks service marks and domain names effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which we operate and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract similarly not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered even if available our failure to protect our intellectual property rights in a meaningful manner or challenges to related contractual rights could result in erosion of brand names and limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names or otherwise which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our businesses have been granted patents andor have patent applications pending with the united states patent and trademark office andor various foreign patent authorities for various proprietary technologies and other inventions we consider applying for patents or for other appropriate statutory protection when we develop valuable new or improved proprietary technologies or identify inventions and will continue to consider the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future proprietary technologies and inventions as circumstances may warrant the status of any patent involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain accordingly any patent application filed may not result in a patent being issued or existing or future patents may not be adjudicated valid by a court or be afforded adequate protection against competitors with similar technology in addition third parties may create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents that we own likewise the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that its processes or inventions will not be found to infringe upon patents or other rights previously issued to third parties 

from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties in addition litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights protect trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others any litigation of this nature regardless of outcome or merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are subject to federal state and local statutes rules regulations policies and procedures both domestically and internationally which are subject to change at any time governing matters such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines andor proceedings against us by governmental agencies andor consumers which if material could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the promulgation of new laws rules and regulations could restrict or unfavorably impact our business which could decrease demand for services reduce revenue increase costs andor subject us to additional liabilities for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

from time to time federal state and local authorities andor consumers commence investigations inquiries or litigation with respect to our compliance with applicable consumer protection advertising unfair business practice antitrust and similar or related laws and other laws our businesses have historically cooperated with authorities in connection with these investigations and have satisfactorily resolved each such material investigation inquiry or litigation we and our ticketsnow business are currently subject to agreements with the states of new jersey and illinois and the ftc which govern and in certain cases place limitations on our ticketing resale practices our competitors in the secondary ticket sales market are not to our knowledge bound by such limitations and as a result we may be at a competitive disadvantage other states and canadian provinces have commenced investigations or inquiries regarding the relationship between us and ticketsnow and other aspects of our ticketing business we have incurred significant legal expenses in connection with the defense of governmental investigations and litigation in the past and may be required to incur additional expenses in the future regarding such investigations and litigation in the case of antitrust and similar or related matters any adverse outcome could limit or prevent us from engaging in the ticketing business generally or in a particular market thereof or subject us to potential damage assessments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 

our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings including those described in note 11—commitments and contingent liabilities to our consolidated financial statements may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings in addition we are currently and from time to time in the future may be subject to various other claims investigations legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties as further described in the immediately preceding risk factor if the results of these investigations proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines penalties injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a thirdparty lawsuit or counterclaim we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues which could harm our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the ordinary course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage would have on our business 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

our concerts and sponsorship segments require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties ownership through an equity interest or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego 

  

these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we may continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

  

  

 additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our revenue depends in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional branding and other marketing campaigns for our live music events the live nation ticketmaster wwwticketmastercom  wwwlivenationcom and other brand names and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related merchandise and apparel and costs related to search engine optimization and paid search engine marketing for our ecommerce sites during 2010 we spent approximately 44 of our revenue on marketing including advertising there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional branding and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote andor ticket many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote andor ticket a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as food beverage and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following past terrorism actions some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our business the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states or others contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

  

risks relating to our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

our stock price has fluctuated between 247 and 1875 over the past three years the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition the board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if any director andor officer of the company who is also a director andor officer of clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate business opportunity a “corporate opportunity” for both us and clear channel we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel unless such opportunity is offered to a director andor officer of the company in writing solely in 

  

such person’s capacity as a director andor officer of the company we have obtained a waiver of this provision to the extent it might apply to irving azoff who is our executive chairman and is also a member of clear channel’s board of directors clear channel will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates more than 35 of our common stock without approval of the board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business andor to repay existing indebtedness accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility includes restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline as of december 31 2010 there were 1741 million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including 30 million shares of unvested restricted stock awards and excluding 13 million shares held in treasury 10 million shares issuable from unvested restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards 95 million shares of common stock issuable from options currently exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of 1643 per share 81 million shares issuable from the conversion of our 2875 convertible notes and a warrant to purchase 05 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1373 

we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of our 2875 convertible notes 

conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

  

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

risks relating to the separation 

the separation could result in significant tax liability to our initial public stockholders 

in connection with the separation clear channel received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualified as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code although a private letter ruling from the irs generally is binding on the irs if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect we will not be able to rely on the ruling 

furthermore the irs will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the ruling is based upon representations by clear channel that these conditions have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling therefore in addition to obtaining the ruling from the irs clear channel also obtained a legal opinion that the separation will qualify as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on the ruling as to matters covered by the ruling in addition the opinion is based on among other things certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by clear channel and us which if incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts and the irs or the courts may not agree with the opinion 

notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and opinion of counsel the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the irs were successful in taking this position our initial public stockholders could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general our initial public stockholders could be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 

the separation could result in significant taxrelated liabilities to us 

as discussed above notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could assert that the separation did not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the irs were successful in taking this position clear channel could be subject to a significant united states federal income tax liability in general clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the separation otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the separation were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the separation and ending two years after are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 

although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel for a more detailed discussion of the tax matters agreement between clear channel and us 

  

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 

each member of the clear channel consolidated group which includes clear channel us and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel were unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel 

risks relating to the spinoff from iac 

if the spinoff of ticketmaster from iac or one or more of the spincos were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes we may be subject to significant tax liabilities 

in connection with iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos iac received a private letter ruling from the irs regarding the qualification of these spinoffs as transactions that are generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes iac’s spinoff of each of the spincos is referred to collectively as the iac spinoffs iac also received an opinion of counsel regarding certain aspects of the transaction that were not covered by the private letter ruling notwithstanding the irs private letter ruling and opinion of counsel the irs could determine that one or more of the iac spinoffs should be treated as a taxable distribution if it determines that any of the representations statements or assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs private letter ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel that are not covered by the irs ruling in addition if any of the representations statements or assumptions upon which the opinion of counsel was based were or become inaccurate the opinion may be invalid 

if any of the iac spinoffs were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes then iac would incur material income tax liabilities for which we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable under applicable federal income tax rules ticketmaster is severally liable for any federal income taxes imposed on iac with respect to taxable periods during which ticketmaster was a member of iac’s consolidated federal income tax return group including the period in which the iac spinoffs were consummated under the tax sharing agreement that ticketmaster entered into with iac and the other spincos ticketmaster generally is required to indemnify iac and the other spincos for any taxes resulting from the spinoff to the extent such amounts resulted from i any act or failure to act by ticketmaster described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement ii any acquisition of equity securities or assets of ticketmaster or iii any breach by ticketmaster of any representation or covenant contained in the spinoff documents or in the documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor tax opinions corresponding indemnification provisions also apply to the other spincos ticketmaster is entitled to indemnification from iac among other things if ticketmaster is liable for or otherwise required to make a payment in respect of a spinoff tax liability for which ticketmaster is not responsible under the tax sharing agreement and if applicable is unable to collect from the spinco responsible for such liability under the tax sharing agreement ticketmaster’s ability to collect under these indemnity provisions would depend on the financial position of the indemnifying party 

certain transactions in iac ticketmaster or other spinco equity securities could cause one or more of the iac spinoffs to be taxable to iac and may give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

current united states federal income tax law creates a presumption that any of the iac spinoffs would be taxable to iac if it is part of a “plan or series of related transactions” pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in iac or a spinco including ticketmaster acquisitions that occur during the fouryear period that begins two years before the date of a spinoff are presumed to occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions unless it is established that the acquisition is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions that includes the spinoff 

these rules limited ticketmaster’s ability during the twoyear period following the spinoff to enter into certain transactions that might have otherwise been advantageous to us and our stockholders particularly issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs repurchasing equity securities and under certain circumstances acquiring businesses or assets with 

  

equity securities or agreeing to be acquired under the tax sharing agreement there were restrictions on ticketmaster’s ability to take such actions for a period of 25 months from the day after the date of the spinoff entering into the merger agreement with live nation did not violate these restrictions because prior to entering into the agreement ticketmaster provided iac with an unqualified opinion of tax counsel contemplated by the tax sharing agreement and iac confirmed that the opinion was satisfactory to iac we believe that we did not take any actions during the twoyear period following the spinoff that compromised the taxfree nature of that transaction however the statutes of limitations related to these tax periods remain open and if taxing authorities successfully assert tax claims against iac related to the spinoff it could give rise to indemnification obligations of ticketmaster under the tax sharing agreement 

in addition to actions of iac and the spincos including ticketmaster certain transactions that are outside their control and therefore not subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the tax sharing agreement such as a sale or disposition of the stock of iac or the stock of a spinco by certain persons that own five percent or more of any class of stock of iac or a spinco could have a similar effect on the taxfree status of a spinoff as transactions to which iac or a spinco is a party 

as a result of these rules even if each iac spinoff otherwise qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for united states federal income tax purposes transactions involving spinco or iac equity securities including transactions by certain significant stockholders could cause iac to recognize taxable gain with respect to the stock of the spinco as described above although the restrictive covenants and indemnification provisions contained in the tax sharing agreement are intended to minimize the likelihood that such an event will occur one or more of the iac spinoffs may become taxable to iac as a result of transactions in iac or spinco equity securities as discussed previously we as successorininterest to ticketmaster could be liable for such taxes under the tax sharing agreement or under applicable federal income tax rules 

in connection with the merger ticketmaster received i two unqualified opinions of tax counsel one dated as of the date of execution of the definitive merger agreement and one dated as of the closing date of the merger that the transaction as contemplated in the definitive merger agreement would not have an adverse tax effect on the spinoff and ii iac’s written acknowledgement that the closing date opinion was in form and substance satisfactory to iac however the irs may disagree with the conclusions in these opinions of counsel and determine that the merger caused the spinoff to be taxable to iac were this to occur and that position were sustained we as successorininterest to ticketmaster would be required to make material indemnification payments to iac 

the spinoff agreements were not the result of arm’s length negotiations 

the agreements that ticketmaster entered into with iac and the other spincos in connection with the iac spinoffs including the separation and distribution agreement tax sharing agreement employee matters agreement and transition services agreement were established by iac in consultation with the spincos with the intention of maximizing the value to iac’s thencurrent shareholders accordingly the terms for ticketmaster may not be as favorable as would have resulted from negotiations among unrelated third parties 

risks relating to the merger 

in connection with the merger we became subject to a final judgment imposing certain obligations and restrictions on us which could negatively impact our business 

on july 30 2010 the united states district court for the district of columbia approved and entered a final judgment relating to the merger that imposes certain obligations on us in order to address the issues the doj raised in its antitrust review of the merger among other things the final judgment required us to offer a license to the ticketmaster ticketing technology to aeg and to divest ticketmaster’s paciolan ticketing business we have entered into a license agreement with aeg and sold paciolan to comcast thus satisfying those two requirements prospectively pursuant to the final judgment we have agreed to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper tying arrangements and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the final judgment the final judgment is in effect and will bind us until july 30 2020 

during the duration of the final judgment we are restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order our compliance with the final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

  

also on january 25 2010 we entered into a consent agreement with the canadian competition commission or the canadian consent agreement which had the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the final judgment on our business in canada the canadian consent agreement will remain in effect for ten years following the date of the agreement the canadian consent agreement creates similar risks for us both in terms of creating potential enforcement actions and in limiting us from pursuing certain business practices

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend cts arbitration 

live nation worldwide inc or live nation worldwide and cts were parties to an agreement or the cts agreement pursuant to which cts was to develop and live nation worldwide licensed or agreed to use ticketing software or ticketing platforms under the agreement cts was to develop software to be licensed to live nation worldwide to provide ticketing services in the united states and canada the cts agreement also generally required live nation worldwide to use cts’s ticketing platforms in certain european countries so long as cts’s existing platforms were appropriately modified to meet local market conditions as of june 13 2010 live nation worldwide terminated the cts agreement because cts materially breached the agreement by failing to deliver a north american ticketing system that met the contractual requirements of being a “world class ticketing system    that fits the needs of the north american market” and by failing to deliver a ticketing system for the united kingdom and other european countries that fit the needs of those markets as required by the cts agreement 

for north america had cts performed on the cts agreement it would have been generally entitled to receive during the then 10year term of the cts agreement a per ticket license fee upon the sale of certain tickets that live nation worldwide or any of certain of its subsidiaries which are collectively referred to as the live nation worldwide entities controlled and had the right to distribute by virtue of certain promotion and venue management relations this per ticket fee for events in north america was payable to cts regardless of whether the live nation worldwide entities chose to use the cts ticketing platform ticketmaster’s ticketing platform or another ticketing platform for the sale of such controlled tickets for events in certain european countries not including the united kingdom live nation worldwide generally was required during a 10year term to exclusively book on the cts ticketing platform all tickets that the live nation worldwide entities had the right to distribute or to the extent other ticketing platforms were used live nation worldwide was generally required to pay to cts the same fee that would have been payable had the cts platform been used for events in the united kingdom live nation worldwide was required for a 10year term to i book on the cts ticketing platform all tickets controlled by live nation worldwide entities that are not allocated by live nation worldwide for sale through other sales channels and ii to offer for sale on the cts uk website a portion of the tickets controlled by the live nation worldwide entities finally the cts agreement obligated live nation worldwide and cts to negotiate a set of noncompete agreements that subject to legal restrictions could have precluded live nation worldwide from offering primary market ticketing services to third parties in certain european countries during the term of the cts agreement 

in april 2010 cts filed a request for arbitration with the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce or icc pursuant to the cts agreement in its request for arbitration cts asserts among other things that i the terms of the cts agreement including the north america per ticket license fee european exclusivity obligations and united kingdom distribution obligations described above apply to tickets sold and distributed by ticketmaster ii ticketmaster’s sales and distribution of tickets following the completion of the merger have resulted in various breaches of live nation worldwide’s obligations under the cts agreement iii live nation has failed to allocate the proper number of tickets to cts’s system in the united kingdom and iv the merger and our subsequent actions have breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its request for arbitration cts seeks relief in the form of a declaration that live nation and live nation worldwide are in breach of the cts agreement and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing specific performance of live nation worldwide’s obligations under the cts agreement and unspecified damages resulting from such breaches we expect that when cts specifies its damages claims they will include damages for royalties that would have been paid over the contemplated 10year term of the cts agreement on ticketmastercontrolled tickets as well as tickets controlled by live nation worldwide or any of certain of its subsidiaries and for competitive injuries due to ticketmaster’s operations in europe 

in may 2010 we responded to cts’s request for arbitration and filed counterclaims asserting that cts breached the cts agreement by failing to provide ticketing platforms that met the standard required by the cts agreement for the north american and european markets we are seeking relief primarily in the form of damages and a declaration that we validly terminated the cts agreement based on cts’s material breaches we deny that cts is entitled to collect damages for royalties that would have been paid over the full 10year term of the cts agreement on ticketmastercontrolled tickets and for competitive injuries due to ticketmaster’s operations in europe the matter has been assigned to an arbitrator and a hearing has been scheduled to commence in july 2011 we intend to vigorously defend the action 

live concert antitrust litigation 

we were a defendant in a lawsuit filed by malinda heerwagen in june 2002 in us district court the plaintiff on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain concert ticket purchasers alleged that anticompetitive practices for concert promotion services by us nationwide caused artificially high ticket prices in august 2003 the district court ruled in our favor denying the plaintiff’s class certification motion the plaintiff appealed to the us court of appeals in january 2006 the court of appeals affirmed and the plaintiff then dismissed her action that same month subsequently twentytwo putative class actions were filed by different named plaintiffs in various us district courts throughout the country making claims substantially similar to those made in the heerwagen action except that the geographic markets alleged are regional statewide or more local in nature and the members of the putative classes are limited to individuals who purchased tickets to concerts in the relevant geographic markets alleged the plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory punitive and treble damages declaratory and injunctive relief and costs of suit including attorneys’ fees we have filed our answers in some of these actions and have denied liability in april 2006 granting our motion the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred these actions to the us district court for the central district of california for coordinated pretrial proceedings in june 2007 the district court conducted a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and also that month the court entered an order to stay all proceedings pending the court’s ruling on class certification in october 2007 the court

the plaintiff filed a class certification motion in august 2009 which ticketmaster opposed in february 2010 the court granted certification of a class on the first two causes of action which allege that ticketmaster misrepresentsomits the fact of a profit component in its shipping and order processing fees the class would consist of california consumers who purchased tickets through ticketmaster’s website from 1999 to present the court denied certification of a class on the third and fourth causes of action which allege that ticketmaster’s shipping and order processing fees are unconscionably high in march 2010 ticketmaster filed a petition for writ of mandate with the california court of appeal and plaintiffs also filed a motion for reconsideration of the superior court’s class certification order in april 2010 the superior court denied plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of the court’s class certification order and the court of appeal denied ticketmaster’s petition for writ of mandate in june 2010 the court of appeal granted the plaintiffs’ petition for writ of mandate and ordered the superior court to vacate its february 2010 order denying plaintiffs’ motion to certify a national class and enter a new order granting plaintiffs’ motion to certify a nationwide class on the first two claims in september 2010 ticketmaster filed its motion for summary judgment on all causes of action in the superior court and that same month plaintiffs filed their motion for summary adjudication of various affirmative defenses asserted by ticketmaster in november 2010 ticketmaster filed their motion to decertify class

canadian consumer class action litigation relating to ticketsnow 

in february 2009 five putative consumer class action complaints were filed in various provinces of canada against ticketsnow ticketmaster ticketmaster canada ltd and premium inventory inc all of the cases allege essentially the same set of facts and causes of action each plaintiff purports to represent a class consisting of all persons who purchased a ticket from ticketmaster ticketmaster canada ltd or ticketsnow from february 2007 to present and alleges that ticketmaster conspired to divert a large number of tickets for resale through the ticketsnow website at prices higher than

executive overview 

in january 2010 we completed our merger with ticketmaster which we believe will allow the combined company to capitalize on multiple opportunities created by bringing together a global concert business global live event ticketing operations and a leading artist management company moving forward our strategy is centered on expanding our presence in the world’s largest markets leveraging our leadership position in live entertainment and ecommerce to sell more tickets and grow our revenue streams surrounding the ticket purchase and live event and continuing to optimize our cost structure 

the combined company is wellpositioned to better serve artists teams fans and venues as we drive innovation across our platform including strengthening our ecommerce operations and improving the ticket purchase experience and capitalizing on the depth and size of our fan databases at the end of 2010 the majority of the integration efforts and staffing reductions were complete we are focused on our evolving operations and executing our growth strategy 

we saw overall weakness in the concert industry in 2010 as the volume of ticket sales declined year over year and decreased our overall attendance by 49 million or 94 however successful promotions helped drive consistent year over year onsite spending at our owned and operated amphitheaters internationally we saw strong festival results including an increase in the net ancillary revenue per attendee at these festivals as well 

reduced ticket sales impacted our ticketing segment as well with ticket volumes declining by 76 overall compared to prior year combined sales as our ticketing clients in aggregate experienced ticket sales declines during 2010 we began executing a series of initiatives aimed at improving the ticket buying experience for live event fans including rolling out interactive seat maps and expanding our digital distribution capabilities such as mobile and social media 

our ecommerce segment generated improved results primarily due to the merger and increased sales of advertising on ticketmastercom during 2010 we began strategically enhancing our online storefront and improving the functionality of our site so that we can capture incremental upsell opportunities to drive future growth our average combined monthly unique visitors increased 32 in 2010 to 261 million and we continued to grow our online advertising 

our sponsorship segment continued to generate growth despite the challenging environment as average sponsorship per sponsor increased in 2010 as compared to the prior year we continued to leverage our extensive onsite and online reach global venue distribution network artist relationships and ticketing operations to secure longterm sponsorship agreements with major brands 

the artist nation segment was impacted by reduced touring by the artists it serves in both the management and services businesses however we continued to grow our artist roster through new signings and strengthened our management team by securing additional artist managers we are actively pursuing strategic acquisitions to grow our international footprint 

we remain optimistic about the longterm future of the company despite current macroeconomic challenges including constrained consumer spending and the resulting decline in ticket sales we remain focused on maximizing our direct connection with millions of fans and further improving the products and services we provide to our clients we will build on the value of our four main levers surrounding the live event – ticketingecommerce artist management sponsorship and onsite ancillary spend we are also focused on expanding our presence in the world’s largest entertainment markets while reducing our exposure to smaller less profitable markets we intend to leverage our fan database and use it to drive increased ticket sales through better marketing increase our value to advertisers through better ad targeting and drive new revenue by providing insights on fan purchasing behaviors to our ticketing clients we also intend to increase ticket sales by helping our clients more efficiently price and market live events and by expanding our digital distribution presence

in 2009 we recorded deferred tax liabilities of 91 million with an offset to goodwill primarily in connection with our 2006 acquisition of hob since the goodwill for a reporting unit within our concerts operating segment was fully impaired during 2008 we immediately recorded an impairment charge of 91 million

our effective tax rate for 2009 was 10 as compared to an effective tax rate of 7 for 2008 the higher net tax expense as compared to the 2008 tax benefit is principally driven by the tax benefit for a portion of us operations in 2008 attributable to the gain on sale of certain discontinued operations

the decreased operating loss for ticketing was primarily a result of increased revenue net of expenses from ticket service charges for events that occurred in 2009 sold by our ticketing operations partially offsetting these increases were higher selling general and administrative and depreciation expenses related to our ticketing platform as we had just begun building our ticketing infrastructure in early 2008

reconciliation of segment operating income loss 

 

 reconciliation of segment adjusted operating income loss 

aoi is a nongaap financial measure that we define as operating income loss before acquisition expenses including transaction costs changes in the fair value of accrued acquisitionrelated contingent consideration arrangements merger bonuses payments under the azoff trust note and mergerrelated severance depreciation and amortization including goodwill impairment loss gain on sale of operating assets and noncash and certain stockbased compensation expense including expense associated with grants of certain stockbased awards which are classified as liabilities  we use aoi to 

  

evaluate the performance of our operating segments we believe that information about aoi assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from nonoperational factors that affect net income thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results aoi is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap a limitation of the use of aoi as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business accordingly aoi should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for operating income loss net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap furthermore this measure may vary among other companies thus aoi as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

the following table sets forth the computation of adjusted operating income loss 

 

   

liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is currently centrally managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements and capital expenditures while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 8928 million at december 31 2010 and 2370 million at december 31 2009 included in the december 31 2010 cash and cash equivalents balance is 3845 million of funds representing amounts equal to the face value of tickets sold on behalf of clients and the clients’ share of convenience and order processing charges or client funds the company does not utilize client funds for its own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients our balance sheet reflects current and longterm debt of 1732 billion at december 31 2010 and 7401 million at december 31 2009 our weightedaverage cost of debt excluding the debt discounts on our term loan and convertible notes and the debt premium on our 1075 senior notes was 60 at december 31 2010 

our available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is invested in interestbearing funds invested in bank deposits  while we monitor cash and cash equivalent balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving loans and counterparties to our interest rate cap agreement consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default 

for our concerts segment we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned andor operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event 

we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less ticketingrelated client funds less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and for cash collected on behalf of others for ticket sales plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions repurchase stock and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our concerts and artist nation segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters whereas our ticketing segment generally reports higher domestic ticketing revenue in the first and second quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

  

sources of cash

capital expenditures 

venue operations and ticketing services operations are capital intensive businesses requiring continual investment in our existing venues and ticketing software in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and information systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network or the development of new online or ticketing tools or technology enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to add revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed 

our capital expenditures including accruals but excluding expenditures funded by outside parties such as insurance companies and landlords consisted of the following 

 

 maintenance capital expenditures for 2010 increased from the prior year primarily due to expenditures for our ticketing systems as part of the merger 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2010 primarily related to ticketing system and website enhancements revenue generating capital expenditures for 2010 decreased from the prior year primarily due to the 2009 development and renovation of various venues including a house of blues club in boston the gibson amphitheater in california and the amg venue expansion in birmingham 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2009 decreased from the prior year primarily due to the 2008 development and renovation of various venues including o 2 dublin in ireland house of blues clubs in houston and boston amg venue expansion in sheffield and the ticketing rollout as compared to the 2009 development projects discussed above 

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and some of the venues used in our music operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into constructionrelated commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled 

  

maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditure commitments as of december 31 2010 are as follows 

 

  

 

  

 during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 262 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2011 through 2015 are 16 million each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business we entered into an assumption agreement with the buyer in connection with the sale under which the buyer is assuming our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2010 

minimum rentals of 972 million to be received in years 2011 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

cash flows 

 

   

operating activities 

year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009 

cash provided by operations was 1585 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 573 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 1012 million increase in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from the increase in the cashrelated portion of net income partially offset by changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing of ticket sales along with the size and number of events for upcoming periods 

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

cash provided by operations was 573 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash used in operations of 626 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 1199 million increase in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing size and number of events for upcoming periods partially offset by a decrease in net income after adjustments for noncash charges and nonoperating activities during 2009 we had lower longterm artistrelated payments paid less accrued eventrelated expenses and collected more accounts receivable as compared to the same period of 2008 resulting in an increase in cash provided by operations conversely we paid more prepaid eventrelated expenses and had less deferred revenue as compared to the same period of 2008 resulting in a partial decrease in cash provided by operations 

investing activities 

year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009 

cash provided by investing activities was 4530 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to 775 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 3755 million increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to cash acquired in the merger partially offset by higher proceeds received in 2009 from the disposal of operating assets 

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

cash provided by investing activities was 775 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash used in investing activities of 669 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 1444 million increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2009 and less cash used in 2009 for acquisitions of certain artist rights partially offset by slightly higher proceeds received in 2008 from the disposal of operating assets as compared to proceeds received in 2009 

financing activities 

year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009 

cash provided by financing activities was 491 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to cash used in financing activities of 1244 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the 1735 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of net proceeds received in 2010 from the issuance of 250 million of 8125 senior notes and our new senior secured credit facility after repayment of the borrowings under the live nation and ticketmaster credit facilities payment of debt issuance costs as well as the redemption of preferred stock as compared to an overall net paydown in the prior year resulting primarily from a paydown on our term loan from asset sale proceeds 

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

cash used in financing activities was 1244 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 340 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 1584 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily a result of a net paydown on our revolving credit facility in 2009 as compared to net borrowings in 2008 additionally in 2009 we paid down 706 million on our term loan from asset sale proceeds compared to 293 million in 2008 

seasonality 

our concerts and artist nation segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and international festivals are primarily used or occur during may through september and our artists touring activity is higher domestic ticketing revenue and operating income in our ticketing segment for concerts and 

  

sporting events are generally earned in the first and second quarters of the year while generally international ticketing revenue and operating income are highest in the fourth quarter of the year earned primarily through concert events in addition the timing of the onsale of tickets and the tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our ticketing segment sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public which vary depending upon scheduling by our clients 

cash flows from our concerts segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a—risk factors our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 1140 million for the year ended december 31 2010 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2010 by 114 million as of december 31 2010 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

we primarily use forward currency contracts in addition to options to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with shortterm artist fee commitments in certain limited instances we also enter into forward currency contracts to minimize the risks andor costs associated with changes in foreign currency rates on shortterm intercompany loans payable to certain international subsidiaries and on forecasted operating income at december 31 2010 we had forward currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of 857 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 1732 billion total debt net of unamortized discounts and premiums outstanding as of december 31 2010 of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we have 9326 million of fixedrate debt and 7993 million of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2010 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 20 million when the floor rate is not applicable this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2010 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

at december 31 2010 we have one interest rate cap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes the interest rate cap had a notional amount of 963 million at december 31 2010 to limit our cash flow exposure to an interest rate of 4 per annum this agreement expires on june 30 2013 the fair value of this agreement at december 31 2010 was an asset of 02 million this agreement was put in place to reduce the variability of a portion of the cash flows from the interest payments related to the may 2010 senior secured credit facility the original terms of the may 2010 senior secured credit facility require one or more interest rate protection agreements with an effect of fixing or limiting the interest costs for at least 50 of the consolidated total funded debt at the closing date for at least three years upon the execution of this interest rate cap agreement the existing interest rate protection agreements fully met this requirement 

  

through our amg subsidiary we have two interest rate swap agreements with a 303 million aggregate notional amount that effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis both agreements expire in december 2015 also in connection with the financing of the redevelopment of the o 2 dublin we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 148 million that expires in december 2013 effectively converting a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

we currently have 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 with a principal amount of 2200 million beginning with the period commencing on july 20 2014 and ending on january 14 2015 and for each of the interest periods commencing thereafter we will pay contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120 of the principal amount of the notes the contingent interest payable per note will equal 025 per year of the average trading price of such note during the applicable five tradingday reference period payable in arrears 

recent accounting pronouncements 

recently adopted pronouncements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued guidance to determine when a variable interest entity should be consolidated along with other accounting and disclosure requirements the pronouncement replaces the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity we adopted this guidance on january 1 2010 and are applying the requirements prospectively our adoption of the variable interest entity guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in january 2010 the fasb issued amended guidance for improving disclosures about fair value measurements this updated guidance requires i disclosure of significant transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and ii presentation of activities within the level 3 rollforward reconciliation on a gross basis in addition the updated guidance requires the following clarifications regarding existing disclosures i a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and ii a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either level 2 or level 3 with the exception of the requirement related to presentation of the activities within the level 3 rollforward reconciliation which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 we adopted this updated guidance on january 1 2010 and have included the required disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 

recently issued pronouncements 

in october 2009 the fasb issued guidance on multipledeliverable revenue arrangements which requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices this guidance eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and requires allocation using the relativesellingprice method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june 15 2010 we will adopt the guidance on january 1 2011 and apply it prospectively the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

in december 2010 the fasb issued guidance on disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations which amends and requires additional pro forma disclosure requirements for material business combinations on an individual or aggregate basis including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as if the acquisition dates had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period this guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure requirements to include a description of the nature and amount of any material nonrecurring adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2010 we will adopt this guidance on january 1 2011 and apply it prospectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 

  

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment contractual advances and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable longlived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights we use assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill for impairment at least annually to determine the fair value of our reporting units the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 

the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units we use both market multiples and discounted cash flow projections in developing fair values inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the performance occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our 

  

owned andor operated venues in the us and where we control the tickets internationally this revenue is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue for these ticket fees collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs these fees will be shared between our ticketing segment and our concerts segment for tickets sold for events for thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

for multiple element contracts we allocate consideration to the multiple elements based on the relative fair values of each separate element which are determined based on prices charged for such items when sold on a standalone basis in cases where there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of certain elements in an arrangement we account for the transaction as a single unit of accounting based on the fasb guidance for multipleelement arrangements  

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction to revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

stockbased compensation 

we follow the fair value recognition provisions of the fasb guidance for stock compensation in accordance with the fasb guidance for stock compensation we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates noncash compensation expense could be materially impacted 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the fasb guidance for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on those foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

the fasb guidance for income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

  

   

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues prior period calculations have been revised to conform to the current period presentation

our assets 

we believe we have a unique portfolio of assets that is unmatched in the live music industry 

 

  

  

  

 

 

   

 our history 

we were formed through acquisitions of various entertainment businesses and assets by our predecessors in august 2005 we were incorporated in our current form as a delaware corporation to own substantially all of the entertainment business of clear channel in december 2005 the separation of the business previously conducted by clear channel’s live entertainment segment and sports representation business and the distribution by clear channel of all of our common stock to its stockholders was completed in a taxfree spinoff following our separation from clear channel we became a separate publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” as of january 25 2010 in connection with our merger with ticketmaster we changed our name from live nation inc to live nation entertainment inc 

our industry 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production according to pollstar  north american gross concert revenue increased from 39 billion in 2007 to 46 billion in 2009 a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9 excluding the impact of acquisitions in the 2007 to 2009 period our north american music and international music revenue comprised primarily of gross concertrelated revenue increased from 36 billion to 40 billion a compound annual growth rate of 6 we believe the industry growth was primarily due to increasing ticket prices for topgrossing acts and the desire of these acts such as u2 and madonna to tour however our growth was impacted by a decline in the number of events and attendance in north american music 

typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with performers to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets performers are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and including the right to offset lower performing shows against higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances promoters in conjunction with performers managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise sponsorships parking and premium seats for the events they host venue operators typically receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as well as percentages of total concession sales from the concessionaire and percentages of total merchandise sales from the merchandisers 

ticketing services include the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels ticketing companies will contract with venues andor promoters to sell tickets to events over a period of time generally three to five years the ticketing company does not set ticket prices or seating charts for events as this information is given to them by the venue andor promoter in charge of the event the ticketing company generally gets paid a fixed fee per ticket sold or a percentage of the total ticket service charges venues will often also sell tickets through a local box office at the venue using the ticketing company’s technology on these box office tickets the ticketing company will generally not earn a fee the ticketing company receives the cash for the ticket sales and related service charges at the time the ticket is sold and periodically remits these receipts to the venue andor promoter after deducting their fee as ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease 

our business 

we operate in three reportable business segments north american music international music and ticketing prior to 2009 the company reported an artist nation segment which is now allocated between the north american music and international music segments information related to these operating segments and other operations for 2009 2008 and 2007 is included in note 18—segment data in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 

  

north american music our north american music segment principally involves the promotion of live music events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues and the operation and management of music venues primarily in the united states and canada as well as providing various services to artists during 2009 our north american music business generated approximately 26 billion or 614 of our total revenue we promoted approximately 9500 north american live music events in 2009 including artists such as u2 jonas brothers and nickelback while our north american music segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters which primarily occur may through september 

as a promoter we typically book performers arrange performances and tours secure venues provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract audiences we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own andor operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenues are generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we contract with promoters including our own to rent our venues for events and provide operational services such as concessions merchandising parking security ushering and tickettaking we generate revenue primarily from the sale of food and beverages parking premium seating rental income venue sponsorships and ticket rebates or service charges earned on tickets sold through phone outlet and internet by third parties under our ticketing agreements or through our internal ticketing operations for events we promote at our venues in our amphitheaters the sale of food and beverages is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenue from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

we believe that we have a unique opportunity to connect the music fan to corporate sponsors and therefore seek to optimize this relationship through the development of strategic sponsorship programs we continue to also pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships and placement of advertising including signage and promotional programs many of our venues have venue naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for advertisers our national sponsorship programs include companies such as citi ® and blackberry our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories 

international music our international music segment principally involves the promotion of live music events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the production of music festivals and the operation and management of music venues outside of north america for 2009 our international music business generated approximately 15 billion or 367 of our total revenue we promoted andor produced nearly 4400 live music events internationally in 2009 including artists such as u2 madonna acdc coldplay and depeche mode as well as several large festivals in europe such as rock werchter in belgium lowlands in the netherlands and reading and leeds  both in the united kingdom while our international music segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of our international festivals which primarily occur june through august 

as a promoter we typically book performers arrange performances and tours secure venues provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract audiences we earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits for each event we either use a venue we own andor operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenues are generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

as a venue operator we contract with promoters to rent our venues for events and provide operational services such as concessions merchandising security ushering and tickettaking we generate revenue primarily from rental income the sale of food and beverages venue sponsorships and ticket rebates earned on tickets sold through phone outlet and internet by third parties under our ticketing agreements for events we promote revenue generated from venue operations typically have a higher margin than promotion revenue and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

ticketing our ticketing segment principally involves the management of our ticketing operations and online and wireless distribution activities including the continued enhancement of our primary website wwwlivenationcom  in addition to management of our information technology operations in north america during 2009 our ticketing business generated approximately 74 million or 18 of our total revenue through all of our ticketing services we sold 126 million tickets in 2009 in north america excluding 25 million tickets sold at our venue box offices our ticketing segment sells tickets primarily for events at our owned andor operated venues in north america 

  

this segment derives the majority of its revenue from service charges earned on tickets sold through our internal ticketing operations and from sponsorships during 2009 the tickets sold by this segment primarily represented those tickets at our owned andor operated venues in north america ticketing pays our north american music segment a ticket rebate equivalent to the amount that they would have received had the ticket been sold by an outside ticketing agency the remainder of the service charge is retained by ticketing 

other for 2009 our other businesses generated approximately 5 million or 01 of our total revenue

the following table summarizes the number of venues by type that we owned operated had booking rights for andor had an equity interest in as of december 31 2009 

 

 competition 

competition in the live music and ticketing industries is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music products sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition financial marketing service support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

our main competitors in the live music industry include anschutz entertainment group c3 presents msg entertainment jam productions and palace sports  entertainment in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe anschutz entertainment group operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets have access to other sports and entertainment venues and have greater financial resources which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own andor operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg and anschutz entertainment group in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets as well as greater financial resources in those markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships consist of local sports teams which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages additionally our competitors locally can include festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

  

the ticketing services industry includes the sale of tickets primarily through online channels but also through phone outlet and box office channels as online ticket purchases increase related ticketing costs generally decrease which has made it easier for technologybased companies to offer primary ticketing services and standalone automated ticketing systems that enable venues to perform their own ticketing services or utilize selfticketing systems in the online environment we compete with other websites online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites 

we experience competition from other national regional and local primary ticketing service providers to secure new venues and to reach fans for events the advent of online commerce has also contributed to the growth of resale ticketing services and the consolidation of the resale industry which historically had been more fragmented and consisted of a significant number of local resellers with limited inventory selling through traditional storefronts the internet has allowed fans and other ticket resellers to reach a vastly larger audience through the aggregation of inventory on online resale websites and marketplaces and has provided consumers with more convenient access to tickets for a larger number and greater variety of events we also face significant and increasing competition from companies that sell selfticketing systems as well as from venues that choose to integrate selfticketing systems into their existing operations or acquire primary ticketing service providers our main competitors for online event sites include ticketscom as well as secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the ada the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

we are required to comply with federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction 

  

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered our most significant trademarks in many foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 4300 fulltime employees including 3200 domestic and 1100 international employees of which approximately 4200 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 100 were employed in our corporate area 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also employ parttime andor seasonal employees as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 4700 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we employed as many as 13000 seasonal employees in 2009 the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our expenses

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our leverage our convertible notes our business our common stock our separation from clear channel and our merger with ticketmaster in addition to the following risks you should consider other risks specific to ticketmaster’s business that will also affect our company these risks are described in item 1a of ticketmaster’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2009 which ticketmaster will file with the sec and under the headings “risks related to the combined company if the merger is completed” “risks relating to the ticketmaster entertainment spinoff” and “risks relating to ticketmaster entertainment’s business and following the completion of the merger the combined company” in our registration statement on form s4 declared effective on november 6 2009 which we have filed with the sec and is incorporated by reference into this annual report these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks associated with our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

as of december 31 2009 live nation’s total indebtedness for borrowed money including its redeemable preferred stock and excluding the debt discount on the convertible notes was approximately 8329 million live nation’s available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of its senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately 1414 million with sublimits up to 2350 million available for letters of credit at december 31 2009 outstanding letters of credit were approximately 423 million as of december 31 2009 ticketmaster’s total indebtedness for borrowed money was approximately 8120 million ticketmaster’s available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of its senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately 1150 million with sublimits up to 200 million available for letters of credit at december 31 2009 outstanding letters of credit were approximately 10 million we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to service our debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 410 million of live nation’s total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2010 1987 million is due in the aggregate for 2011 and 2012 5799 million is due in the aggregate for 2013 and 2014 and 133 million is due thereafter see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments as of december 31 2009 no portion of ticketmaster’s total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2010 318 million is due in the aggregate for 2011 and 2012 4932 million is due in the aggregate for 2013 and 2014 and 2870 million is due thereafter 

  

live nation’s redeemable preferred stock bears an annual dividend rate of 13 or 52 million annually and is subject to financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants applicable to its senior secured credit facility if live nation exceeds certain of these covenants it will have to pay additional dividends in addition as of december 31 2009 live nation had approximately 14 billion in operating lease agreements of which approximately 819 million is due in 2010 and 818 million is due in 2011 as of december 31 2009 ticketmaster had approximately 990 million in operating lease agreements of which approximately 266 million is due in 2010 and 192 million is due in 2011 

our ability to service our debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist advances and capital expenditures for venue construction expansion or renovation will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we cannot predict the impact to our ability to access additional capital in light of the current uncertainty in the credit market if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility other future debt and our redeemable preferred stock may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt redeemable preferred stock or lease service obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all as a result the inability to meet our debt redeemable preferred stock or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our redeemable preferred stock designations and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities our redeemable preferred stock designations and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our senior secured credit facilities and redeemable preferred stock designations include other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable if we default under any of the covenants applicable to our redeemable preferred stock the holders of our redeemable preferred stock may be entitled to elect a director of one of our subsidiaries and we will have to pay additional dividends 

these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs furthermore they may restrict our ability to expand to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations thereunder accelerated our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 

  

we will depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we will rely on distributions and loans from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facilities and the outstanding redeemable preferred stock of our subsidiary and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring business could result in the loss of key tours 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to post a letter of credit or advance cash to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our revolving credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted 

risks relating to our 2875 convertible senior notes 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments which may increase note holders’ credit risk 

in july 2007 we issued 220 million of 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended on july 15 2014 july 15 2017 and july 15 2022 or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts to the repurchase date in addition at any time on or prior to june 15 2027 we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to 1000 for each 1000 in principal amount of notes converted however it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes in addition some of our existing financing agreements contain and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness could contain provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt if we do not obtain such consent or refinance the debt we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 

the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 

if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july 15 2014 we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction furthermore holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july 15 2014 or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price there will be no 

  

increase in the conversion rate in addition in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and if we so elect holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 

prior to july 15 2027 the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock as applicable for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 

if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock including by making a net share settlement election the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined subject to certain exceptions by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the 20 trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion or if tendered within the 20 days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases after holders of notes tender their notes for conversion the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 

the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events including but not limited to the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock or for a thirdparty tender offer for example the conversion rate was not adjusted as a result of our merger with ticketmaster 

risks relating to our business 

our live music business is highly sensitive to public tastes and dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our ability to generate revenue from our music operations is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform live music content any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those key artists do not continue to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected 

in addition we typically book our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agree to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any operating income therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or a performer cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as foregone revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if a performer cancels a tour but it may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our operating results and profitability 

we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results from continuing operations have been adversely affected by among other things event profitability and overhead costs live nation incurred net losses of approximately 1260 million 3335 million and 623 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively we may face reduced demand for our live music events and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods 

  

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results 

the following table sets forth live nation’s operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 

 

  

we may be adversely affected by the current or any future general deterioration in economic conditions which could affect consumer and corporate spending and therefore significantly adversely impact our operating results 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live music events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during past economic slowdowns and recessions many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live music events 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation which can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seat sales sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and souvenir sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any further or future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

loss of our key promoters management and other personnel could result in the loss of key tours and negatively impact our business 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within the live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts 

  

doing business in foreign countries creates risks not found in doing business in the united states 

live nation’s international operations accounted for approximately 35 of its revenue in 2009 ticketmaster’s international operations accounted for approximately 27 of its revenue in 2009 the risks involved in foreign operations that could result in losses against which we are not insured include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we may incur substantial tax liabilities if we repatriate any of the cash generated by our international operations back to the united states due to significant current limitations on our ability to recognize foreign tax credits that would be associated with such repatriation we could repatriate some of the cash generated by our international operations and use certain of our substantial net operating losses to offset associated tax liabilities we are not currently in a position to recognize any tax assets in the united states that are the result of payments of income or withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2009 live nation’s international operations accounted for approximately 35 of its revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound and the euro live nation experienced a foreign exchange rate net loss of 399 million in 2009 which had a negative effect on its operating income and in 2008 and 2007 live nation had net gains of 02 million and 35 million respectively which had a positive effect on its operating income see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for the year ended december 31 2009 ticketmaster’s international operations accounted for approximately 27 of its revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound the canadian dollar and the euro ticketmaster experienced foreign exchange rate net losses of 72 million and 22 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively which had a negative effect on its operating income and in 2007 ticketmaster had a net gain of 33 million which had a positive effect on its operating income 

we may enter into future acquisitions and longterm artist rights arrangements and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our growth strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities we also may enter into additional longterm arrangements with certain artists under which we would acquire the rights to certain musicrelated activities including touring merchandising recording online fan clubs filmdvd and other rights or a subset of these rights in the event of future acquisitions or artist rights arrangements we could 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions including among others our acquisitions of hob and an equity interest in amg we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals acquisitions involve risks including those associated with 

 

  

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things expenses to pursue the acquisition the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in other jurisdictions also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

in addition the credit agreement for the senior secured credit facility and the terms of our subsidiary’s redeemable preferred stock restrict our ability to make acquisitions 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or venues that we rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events causing a decrease in our revenue we are currently subject to wrongful death claims as well as other litigation while we maintain insurance polices that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

  

the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information and related systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent us from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in the systems and infrastructures of our business our affiliates andor third parties or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair the ability of our business to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

in the processing of consumer transactions we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our business moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by our business the failure of us andor the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage the reputation of our business discourage potential users from trying the products and services that we offer andor result in fines andor proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs including coverage for acts of terrorism we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans at december 31 2009 live nation had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 7500 million at december 31 2009 ticketmaster had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 1010 million 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

  

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at reasonable costs to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our venues to meet longterm increasing demand to increase entertainment value and to increase revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our venues including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our live music venue operations are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

we cannot predict the extent to which any future laws or regulations will impact our operations the regulations relating to our food service in our venues are many and complex although we generally contract with a thirdparty vendor for these services at our owned andor operated venues we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty vendors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we or our thirdparty vendors will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or that we will not be held liable for violations by thirdparty vendors furthermore additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance 

we also serve alcoholic beverages at many of our venues during live music events and must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us we cannot assure you that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance we must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the states in which we serve alcoholic beverages 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues additionally certain laws and regulations could hold us strictly jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of hazardous substance contamination at our facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites and could hold us responsible for any personal or property damage related to any contamination 

we face intense competition in the live music ticketing and artist services industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business segments are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue we compete in the live music industry and within this industry we compete with other venues to book performers and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 

we compete in the ticketing industry and the intense competition that we face in the ticketing industry could cause the volume of our ticketing services business to decline there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future with existing or potential competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition we may face direct competition in the live music industry with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients who primarily include live event content providers such as owners or operators of live event venues this direct competition with our prospective or current primary ticketing clients could result in a decline in the number of clients we may obtain and a decline in the volume of our ticketing services business which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the number of sponsors event attendance ticket prices or profit margins include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 we believe that barriers to entry into the live music promotion business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that a potential work stoppage will have on our expenses 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties or equity or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we plan to continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

  

  

 additionally the market potential of live music venue sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

  

our revenues depend in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns for our live music events and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related souvenir merchandise and apparel during 2009 live nation spent approximately 43 of its revenue and ticketmaster spent approximately 44 of its revenue on marketing including advertising and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and merchandise among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as food beverage and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods if we are unable to reschedule events due to poor weather we are forced to refund the ticket revenue for those events 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following past terrorism actions some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our music business the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

risks relating to our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

our stock price has fluctuated between 247 and 2563 over the past three years the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and investors could lose all or part of the value of their common stock 

in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent in addition our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and clear channel we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel clear channel will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock and in the case of liberty media and certain of its affiliates 35 or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control and the redeemable preferred stock requires one of our subsidiaries to offer to repurchase the redeemable preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—redeemable preferred stock 

  

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition our redeemable preferred stock and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility include restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline as of december 31 2009 there were 844 million shares of live nation common stock outstanding including 07 million shares of unvested restricted stock awards and excluding treasury shares 21 million shares of common stock issuable from currently exercisable live nation options at a weighted average exercise price of 1721 per share and a warrant to purchase 05 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1373 as of december 31 2009 there were 574 million shares of ticketmaster common stock outstanding excluding treasury shares and 22 million shares of common stock issuable from currently exercisable ticketmaster options at a weighted average exercise price of 2907 per share these ticketmaster outstanding shares were exchanged for live nation common stock and ticketmaster options were assumed by live nation in connection with the merger 

we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of the notes 

conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by our board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

risks relating to our separation from clear channel 

the separation could result in significant tax liability to our initial public stockholders 

clear channel received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualifies as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code although a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service generally is binding on the internal revenue service if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect we will not be able to rely on the ruling 

furthermore the internal revenue service will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the ruling is based upon representations by clear channel that these conditions have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the 

  

ruling therefore in addition to obtaining the ruling from the internal revenue service clear channel made it a condition to the separation that clear channel obtain a legal opinion that the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on the ruling as to matters covered by the ruling in addition the opinion is based on among other things certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by clear channel and us which if incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and the internal revenue service or the courts may not agree with the opinion 

notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position our initial public stockholders could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general our initial public stockholders could be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 

the separation could result in significant taxrelated liabilities to us 

as discussed above notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position clear channel could be subject to a significant united states federal income tax liability in general clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the distribution otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the distribution were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 

although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel for a more detailed discussion of the tax matters agreement between clear channel and us 

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 

each member of the clear channel consolidated group which includes clear channel our company and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel has recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel is unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12—relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel 

risks relating to our merger with ticketmaster 

the merger resulted in changes to our board and management that may affect our strategy 

upon completion of the merger the composition of our board of directors and management team changed in accordance with the merger agreement as seven new members from ticketmaster were appointed to our board in addition we have a new executive chairman this new board and management may affect the business strategy and operating decisions of the combined company 

  

although we expect that the merger will result in benefits to live nation we may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges 

the merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently with principal offices in two locations due to legal restrictions we have conducted only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two companies the success of the combination of live nation and ticketmaster will be dependent in large part on the success of our management in integrating the operations technologies and personnel of the two companies our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully completing the integration of the operations of live nation and ticketmaster or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger including additional revenue opportunities could impair our results of operations 

challenges involved in this integration include without limitation 

 

  

  

 we may not successfully complete the integration of the operations in a timely manner and we may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger to the extent or in the timeframe anticipated the anticipated benefits and synergies include cost savings associated with anticipated restructurings and other operational efficiencies and revenue enhancement opportunities however these anticipated benefits and synergies assume a successful integration and are based on projections which are inherently uncertain and other assumptions even if integration is successful anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved 

in connection with the merger we became subject to a proposed final judgment imposing certain obligations on us and in addition the us department of justice or the us district court may seek to modify the terms of the proposed final judgment before it is entered as final and any such changes could negatively impact the company’s business 

on january 25 2010 the us department of justice or the doj and several state attorneys general jointly filed with the us district court for the district of columbia a complaint against the proposed merger between live nation and ticketmaster and a proposed final judgment or the proposed final judgment that imposes certain obligations on us in order to address the issues the doj raised in its complaint among other things the proposed final judgment requires us to offer a license to the ticketmaster host ticketing technology to anschutz entertainment group to divest ticketmaster’s paciolan ticketing business to a dojapproved purchaser within 60 days to agree to abide by certain behavioral remedies that prevent us from engaging in retaliatory business tactics or improper trying arrangements and to provide periodic reports to the doj about our compliance with the proposed final judgment the proposed final judgment is subject to a 60day public comment period after which time the court may enter the final judgment as written or it may modify the order the final judgment will be in effect and will bind us for ten years from the date that the court enters it we stipulated to an interim hold separate order on january 25 2010 that commits us to complying with the terms of the proposed final judgment until a final judgment is entered by the court 

during the duration of the final judgment we will be restricted from engaging in certain business activities that absent the final judgment would be lawful for us to undertake our inability to undertake these business strategies could disadvantage us when we compete against firms that are not restricted by any such order our compliance with the final judgment therefore creates certain unquantifiable business risks for us 

also on january 25 2010 we entered into a consent agreement or the canadian consent agreement with the canadian competition commission which had the effect of imposing essentially the same terms as the proposed final judgment on our business in canada the canadian consent agreement will remain in effect for ten years following the date of the agreement the canadian consent agreement creates similar risks for us both in terms of creating potential enforcement actions and in limiting us from pursuing certain business practices 

the terms of live nation worldwide’s agreement with cts will cause live nation worldwide to incur ongoing costs and could reduce operational efficiencies that the combined company might otherwise obtain through the merger 

live nation worldwide inc which is referred to as live nation worldwide and cts eventim ag which is referred to as cts are parties to an agreement which is referred to as the cts agreement pursuant to which cts licenses intellectual property to live nation worldwide that is core to live nation’s inhouse ticketing platform under the terms of the cts agreement live nation worldwide will be required to take actions and incur expenses and may be limited in actions it can take which could limit the ability of live nation and ticketmaster to fully integrate their ticketing platforms successfully and realize the full operational efficiencies that the combined company might otherwise obtain through the merger for events in north america cts will be generally entitled to receive during the 10year term of the agreement a per ticket license fee upon the sale of certain tickets that live nation worldwide or any of substantially all of its subsidiaries which are collectively referred to as the live nation worldwide entities have the right to distribute this per ticket fee for events in north america will be payable to cts regardless of whether the combined company chooses to use the cts ticketing platform ticketmaster’s ticketing platform or another ticketing platform for the sale of tickets that the live nation worldwide entities have the right to distribute in addition for events in certain european countries outside of the united kingdom live nation worldwide generally will be required during a 10year term to exclusively book on the cts ticketing platform all tickets that the live nation worldwide entities have the right to distribute or to the extent other ticketing platforms are used live nation worldwide will generally be required to pay to cts the same fee that would have been payable had the cts platform been used for events in the united kingdom live nation worldwide will be required provided that cts first satisfies a significant threshold commitment to offer for sale on the cts uk website and pay a corresponding fee for a portion of the tickets that the live nation worldwide entities have the right to distribute for events promoted by the live nation worldwide entities for a 10year term commencing on january 1 2010 finally the live nation worldwide entities may be precluded from offering ticketing services to third parties in certain european countries during the term of the cts agreement in addition upon completion of the merger for a period of two years thereafter cts will have the right to terminate the cts agreement upon six months advance notice

executive overview 

in february 2009 we announced our planned merger with ticketmaster which we believe will allow the combined company to capitalize on strategic advantages and other opportunities created by combining a global concert business global ticketing operations and an artist management company including lowering costs and developing new distribution platforms and new revenue streams through sponsorships and increased sales and distribution opportunities based on our belief that the merger would produce a vertically integrated combined company that would be positioned to address the challenges of serving artists and fans better through improved ticketing options dynamic promotion arrangements and greater transparency with respect to ticket pricing this merger was completed in january 2010 

in 2009 prior to the completion of the merger our mission was to maximize the revenue generated by the live concert experience driven by serving three clients—artists fans and sponsors during the year we continued to execute on our strategy to improve and build our core business the highlights for each of our segments for 2009 were

segment overview 

our reportable segments are north american music international music and ticketing prior to 2009 we reported an artist nation segment which is now allocated between the north american music and international music segments this change has been made to be consistent with the way we are now managing the business our business formerly reported as artist nation includes the promotion andor production of global tours and also provides other services to artists these artist relationships tend to be longterm and typically involve multiple revenue streams for an artist we enter into these relationships in order to fill the distribution platform of our businesses with recurring events both domestically and internationally this is not a separate part of these businesses but rather is just one more facet of our north american music and international music segments therefore we are now allocating these activities based on where the profits for services to these artists are being generated 

north american music 

our north american music segment principally involves the promotion of live music events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues and the operation and management of music venues primarily in the united states and canada as well as providing various services to artists while our north american music segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters which primarily occur may through september 

to judge the health of our north american music segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events in our network of owned andor operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance total revenue per fan and advance ticket sales in addition at our owned andor operated venues we monitor attendance ancillary revenue per fan premium seat sales and corporate sponsorship sales 

international music 

our international music segment principally involves the promotion of live music events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues the operation and management of music venues and the production of music festivals outside of north america while our international music segment operates yearround we experience higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of our international festivals which primarily occur june through august 

  

to judge the health of our international music segment we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events in our network of owned andor operated and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance and advance ticket sales in addition at our owned andor operated venues we monitor attendance and ancillary revenue per fan because this business is conducted in foreign markets we look at the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 

ticketing 

our ticketing segment manages our digital platform and live nation’s ticketing activities this segment is involved in managing our internal ticketing operations and online distribution activities including the ongoing enhancement of our primary website wwwlivenationcom and our information technology operations 

to judge the health of our ticketing segment we primarily review the number of tickets sold through our ticketing operations the percentage of visitors to our website that buy tickets the number of unique visitors to our websites and the overall number of customers in our database

more detailed explanations of the changes for the years ended 2009 and 2008 are included in the applicable segment discussions contained herein 

goodwill impairment 

we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process the first step used to screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the second step employed for any reporting unit that fails the first step is used to measure the amount of any potential impairment and compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

in september 2008 in connection with the sale of our noncore events business which has been classified as discontinued operations we reviewed the carrying value of our noncore events assets based on an indicator that future operating cash flows may not support their carrying value based on expected sales proceeds it was determined that those assets were impaired since the estimated undiscounted cash flows based on expected sales proceeds associated with those assets were less than their carrying value as a result we recorded a 130 million goodwill impairment charge related to the goodwill for this noncore events business as a component of operating expenses in discontinued operations we are not continuing to operate in the noncore events business 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 while we were performing our annual impairment test as of october 1 we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization since a favorable result from an october 1 test would not have prevented a second impairment test at december 31 2008 a single impairment test was completed as of december 31 2008 based upon the results of this impairment test that was performed we recorded an impairment charge of 2699 million related to reporting units within our north american music operating segment which represented all of the remaining goodwill previously recorded for these reporting units 

during the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded deferred tax liabilities of 91 million with an offset to goodwill primarily in connection with our 2006 acquisition of hob since the goodwill for the reporting units within our north american music operating segment was fully impaired during 2008 we immediately recorded an impairment charge of 91 million

reconciliation of segment operating income loss 

 

 liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is currently managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements and capital expenditures while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily acquisition related our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 2370 million and current and longterm debt of 7401 million at december 31 2009 and cash and cash equivalents of 1997 million and current and longterm debt of 8241 million at december 31 2008 these debt balances do not include our outstanding redeemable preferred stock 

our available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash cash held in operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits the invested cash is invested in interestbearing funds managed by thirdparty financial institutions while we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents and market conditions 

the lenders under our revolving credit facility and counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements discussed below consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate swap agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default 

we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue at our owned andor operated venues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and for cash collected on behalf of others for ticket sales plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions repurchase stock and finance revenuegenerating capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses an example of seasonal effects includes our north american music and international music segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of 

  

the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case and capital could be less accessible andor more costly given current economic conditions we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year

capital expenditures 

venue operations is a capital intensive business requiring continual investment in our existing venues in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays between maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and to a lesser extent capital expenditures related to information systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to add revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation 

our accrued capital expenditures consisted of the following 

 

 revenue generating capital expenditures for 2009 decreased from the prior year primarily due to the 2008 development and renovation of various venues including o 2 dublin house of blues clubs in houston and boston amg venue expansion in sheffield and the ticketing rollout 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2008 increased significantly from the prior year primarily due to the development and renovation of various venues including o 2 dublin in ireland house of blues clubs in houston and boston the hollywood palladium amg venue expansions in sheffield and leeds as well as for our ticketing rollout the decrease in maintenance capital expenditures in 2008 as compared to the prior year is due to various projects in 2007 including the rollout of a new financial software system office building moves for a few locations and information technology costs for hardware and software including the buildout of a new data center 

contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and some of the venues used in our music operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into construction related commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

  

the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditure commitments as of december 31 2009 are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 278 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2010 through 2014 are 16 million each year the venues under the lease agreement were included in the sale of our north american theatrical business we entered into an assumption agreement with the buyer in connection with the sale under which the buyer is assuming our obligations under the guaranty however we remain contingently liable to the lessor we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2009 

minimum rentals of 1009 million to be received in years 2010 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

cash flows 

 

   

operating activities 

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

cash provided by operations was 573 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash used in operations of 626 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 1199 million increase in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing size and number of events for upcoming periods partially offset by a decrease in net income after adjustments for noncash charges and nonoperating activities during 2009 we had lower longterm artistrelated payments paid less accrued eventrelated expenses and collected more accounts receivable as compared to the same period of 2008 resulting in an increase in cash provided by operations conversely we paid more prepaid eventrelated expenses and had less deferred revenue as compared to the same period of 2008 resulting in a partial decrease in cash provided by operations 

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

cash used in operations was 626 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to cash provided by operations of 364 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 990 million increase in cash used in operations resulted primarily from advances related to entering into certain artist rights agreements and changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing size and number of events for upcoming periods the accounts primarily affected by this event timing were accrued eventrelated expenses which decreased as compared to an increase last year and resulted in a decrease in cash used in operating activities partially offset by prepaid eventrelated expenses which increased less than last year and resulted in a decrease in cash used in operating activities 

investing activities 

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

cash provided by investing activities was 701 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash used in investing activities of 669 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 1370 million increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2009 and less cash used in the current year for acquisitions of certain artist rights partially offset by slightly higher proceeds received in 2008 from the disposal of operating assets as compared to proceeds received in 2009 

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

cash used in investing activities was 669 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 1296 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 627 million decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher proceeds received in 2008 from the sale of our motor sports events and north american theatrical businesses as compared to proceeds received in 2007 from the sales of an arenarace track in leicestershire england an amphitheater in nashville an office building in san francisco two music theaters and seven clubs in london and our production of phantom–vegas additionally we used more cash in the prior year related to our acquisitions of signatures amg and hob canada as compared to the amounts used for our 2008 acquisitions partially offsetting these decreases in cash used in investing activities were higher capital expenditures and acquisitions of certain artist rights in 2008 

financing activities 

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

cash used in financing activities was 1170 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 340 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the 1510 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily a result of a net paydown on our revolving credit facility in 2009 as compared to net borrowings in 2008 additionally in 2009 we paid down 706 million on our term loan from asset sale proceeds compared to 293 million in 2008 

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

cash provided by financing activities was 340 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 1102 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 762 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of reduced net borrowings in 2008 as compared to the same period in the prior year included in 2007 was the issuance of our 2875 convertible senior notes while 2008 included higher net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and lower term loan repayments than in 2007 additionally in 2008 we purchased stock in connection with a put option related to an artist rights agreement which used cash and therefore reduced cash provided by financing activities 

  

seasonality 

our north american music and international music segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and international festivals are primarily used or occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted 

cash flows from our north american music and international music segments typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we generally begin to receive payments from ticket sales in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a—risk factors our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 847 million for the year ended december 31 2009 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2009 by 85 million as of december 31 2009 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

we use forward currency contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with shortterm artist fee commitments at december 31 2009 we had forward currency contracts outstanding with notional amounts totalling 79 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 7401 million total debt net of debt discount outstanding as of december 31 2009 of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we have 4129 million of fixedrate debt and 3272 million of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2009 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 08 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2009 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

at december 31 2009 we have one interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes the plain vanilla interest rate swap had a notional amount of 1500 million at december 31 2009 to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis this agreement expires on september 30 2010 the fair value of this agreement at december 31 2009 was a liability of 33 million this agreement was put in place to eliminate or reduce the variability of a portion of the cash flows from the interest payments related to our senior secured credit facility the terms of our senior secured credit facility required that an interest rate swap be put in place for at least 50 of the original 325 million senior term loan and for at least three years 

as part of the acquisition of amg we have an interest rate swap agreement with a 174 million aggregate notional amount that effectively converts a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis this agreement expires in january 2015 also in connection with the financing of the redevelopment of the o 2 dublin we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 195 million that expires in december 2013 effectively converting a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

  

in july 2007 we issued 2200 million of 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 beginning with the period commencing on july 20 2014 and ending on january 14 2015 and for each of the interest periods commencing thereafter we will pay contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120 of the principal amount of the notes the contingent interest payable per note will equal 025 per year of the average trading price of such note during the applicable five tradingday reference period payable in arrears

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment contractual advances and definitelived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable longlived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights the company uses assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill for impairment at least annually to determine the fair value of our reporting units the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 

the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units we use both market multiples and discounted cash flow projections in developing fair values inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the performance occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned andor operated venues this revenue is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue for these ticket fees collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs these fees will be shared between our ticketing segment and the north american music segment for tickets sold for events for thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

for multiple element contracts we allocate consideration to the multiple elements based on the relative fair values of each separate element which are determined based on prices charged for such items when sold on a stand alone basis in cases where there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of certain elements in an arrangement we account for the transaction as a single unit of accounting per the requirements of asc subtopic 60525 multipleelement arrangements  

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction to revenue 

  

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

stockbased compensation 

we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic 718 compensation—stock compensation or asc 718 in accordance with asc 718 we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates noncash compensation expense could be materially impacted 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with asc topic 740 income taxes  or asc 740 under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our continuing foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on those foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal and state income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

asc 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

  

 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues prior period calculations have been revised to conform to the current period presentation

 our history

our industry 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production according to pollstar  north american gross concert revenue increased from 36 billion in 2006 to 42 billion in 2008 a compound annual growth rate of approximately 8 excluding the impact of acquisitions in the 2006 to 2008 period our north american music international music and artist nation revenue comprised primarily of gross concertrelated revenue increased from 31 billion to 37 billion a compound annual growth rate of 10 we believe this growth was primarily due to increasing ticket prices for topgrossing acts and the desire of these acts such as madonna and u2 to tour 

typically to initiate live music events or tours booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or 

  

index to financial statements directly with performers to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets performers are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and including the right to offset lower performing shows with higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for music tours one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances promoters in conjunction with performers managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise sponsorships parking and premium seats for the events they host venue operators typically receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as well as percentages of total concession sales from the concessionaire and percentages of total merchandise sales from the merchandisers

 competition 

competition in the live music industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality music products and enhanced fan and artist experiences we believe that our primary strengths include 

 

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

 although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition financial marketing service support technical and other resources 

in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from promoters and venue operators we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

our main competitors in the live music industry include anschutz entertainment group jam productions and palace sports  entertainment in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe anschutz entertainment group operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets and have access to other sports and entertainment venues as well as greater financial resources which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own andor operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region consequently touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg and anschutz entertainment group in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets as well as greater financial resources in those markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorships consist of local sports teams which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages additionally our competitors locally can include festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

in the online environment we compete with other website online event sites and ticketing companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites our main competitors for online event sites include ticketmaster and ticketscom as well as secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

 we believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food including in some cases requirements relating to the temperature of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the united kingdom’s disability discrimination act 1995 or the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to customers and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect our trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” “house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered our most significant trademarks in many foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 4700 fulltime employees including 3300 domestic and 1400 international employees of which approximately 4600 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 130 were employed in our corporate area 

  

index to financial statements our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also from time to time employ parttime andor seasonal employees as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 4800 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we have employed as many as 12000 seasonal employees the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our produced andor promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses 

executive officers

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our leverage our convertible notes our business our common stock and our separation from clear channel the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks associated with our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

as of december 31 2008 our total indebtedness for borrowed money including our redeemable preferred stock was approximately 9257 million our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately 1207 million with sublimits up to 2350 million available for letters of credit at december 31 2008 outstanding letters of credit were approximately 423 million we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to service our debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist advances and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 486 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2009 734 million is due in the aggregate for 2010 and 2011 5498 million is due in the aggregate for 2012 and 2013 and 2539 million is due thereafter see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our redeemable preferred stock bears an annual dividend rate of 13 or 52 million annually and is subject to financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants applicable to our senior secured credit facility if we exceed certain of these covenants we will have to pay additional dividends in addition as 

  

index to financial statements of december 31 2008 we had approximately 11 billion in operating lease agreements of which approximately 779 million is due in 2009 and 724 million is due in 2010 

our ability to service our debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist advances and capital expenditures for venue construction expansion or renovation will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we cannot predict the impact to our ability to access additional capital in light of the current uncertainty in the credit market if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity we may be subject to limitations on the assets we can sell under the terms of the tax matters agreement with clear channel in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility other future debt and our redeemable preferred stock may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt redeemable preferred stock or lease service obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all as a result the inability to meet our debt redeemable preferred stock or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility our redeemable preferred stock designations and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility our redeemable preferred stock designations and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our senior secured credit facility and redeemable preferred stock designations include other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would 

  

index to financial statements entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable if we default under any of the covenants applicable to our redeemable preferred stock the holders of our redeemable preferred stock may be entitled to elect a director of one of our subsidiaries and we will have to pay additional dividends 

these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs furthermore they may restrict our ability to expand to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations thereunder accelerated our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 

we will depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we will rely on distributions and advances from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans advances or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and may have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us may be subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and the outstanding redeemable preferred stock of our subsidiary and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring business could result in the loss of key tours 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to post a letter of credit or advance cash to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our revolving credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted 

risks relating to our 2875 convertible senior notes 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments which may increase note holders’ credit risk 

in july 2007 we issued 220 million of 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended on july 15 2014 july 15 2017 and july 15 2022 or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts to the repurchase date in addition at any time on or prior to june 15 2027 we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to 1000 for each 1000 in principal amount of notes converted however it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes in addition some of our existing financing agreements contain and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our 

  

index to financial statements indebtedness could contain provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt if we do not obtain such a consent or refinance the debt we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 

the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 

if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july 15 2014 we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction furthermore holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july 15 2014 or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price there will be no increase in the conversion rate in addition in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and if we so elect holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 

prior to july 15 2027 the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock as applicable for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 

if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock including by making a net share settlement election the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined subject to certain exceptions by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the 20 trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion or if tendered within the 20 days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases after holder of notes tender their notes for conversion the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 

  

index to financial statements the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events including but not limited to the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock or for a thirdparty tender offer for example the conversion rate will not be adjusted as a result of our pending merger with ticketmaster 

risks relating to our business 

our live music business is highly sensitive to public tastes and dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live music events and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our ability to generate revenue from our music operations is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform live music content any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those key artists do not continue to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected 

in addition we typically book our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agree to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any operating income therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or a performer cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as foregone revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses if a performer cancels a tour furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our operating results and profitability 

we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results from continuing operations have been adversely affected by among other things event profitability and overhead costs we incurred net losses of approximately 3202 million 558 million and 549 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively we may face reduced demand for our live music events and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours tour cancellations capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance 

  

index to financial statements in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 

 

 we may be adversely affected by the current or any future general deterioration in economic conditions which could affect consumer and corporate spending and therefore significantly adversely impact our operating results 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live music events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during past economic slowdowns and recessions many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live music events 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seats sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and souvenir sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by current economic conditions or by any further or future deterioration in economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

loss of our key promoters management and other personnel could result in the loss of key tours and negatively impact our business 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within the live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations although we have entered into longterm agreements 

  

index to financial statements with many of those individuals to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts 

doing business in foreign countries creates risks not found in doing business in the united states 

our international operations accounted for approximately 36 of our revenue in 2008 the risks involved in foreign operations that could result in losses against which we are not insured include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we may incur substantial tax liabilities if we repatriate any of the cash generated by our international operations back to the united states due to our current inability to recognize any foreign tax credits that would be associated with such repatriation we could repatriate some of the cash generated by our international operations and to use certain of our substantial net operating losses to offset associated tax liabilities we are not currently in a position to recognize any tax assets in the united states that are the result of payments of income or withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2008 our international operations accounted for approximately 36 of our revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound and the euro in 2008 2007 and 2006 we experienced foreign exchange rate net gains of 23 million 45 million and 32 million respectively for those periods which had a positive effect on our operating income see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and longterm artist rights arrangements and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our growth strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities such as our pending merger with ticketmaster discussed under “—risks relating to the pending merger with ticketmaster” 

  

index to financial statements we also may enter into additional longterm arrangements with certain artists under which we would acquire the rights to certain musicrelated activities including touring merchandising recording online fan clubs filmdvd and other rights in the event of future acquisitions or artist rights arrangements we could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions including among others our acquisitions of hob entertainment inc or hob concert productions international or cpi and an equity interest in academy music holdings limited or amg we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals acquisitions involve risks including those associated with 

 

  

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in other jurisdictions also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition 

  

index to financial statements of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

in addition restrictions contained in the tax matters agreement between us and clear channel the credit agreement for the senior secured credit facility and the terms of our subsidiary’s redeemable preferred stock restrict our ability to make acquisitions 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live music events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live music events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live music events at any of our venues or venues that we rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events causing a decrease in our revenue we are currently subject to wrongful death claims as well as other litigation while we maintain insurance polices that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in these systems and infrastructures may have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the success of our ticketing operations depends in part on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructures including websites information and related systems call centers and distribution and fulfillment facilities system interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in the information systems and infrastructures of our ticketing operations may adversely affect our ability to operate websites process and fulfill transactions respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain costefficient operations we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent us from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders we also rely on affiliate and thirdparty computer systems broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally as well as to facilitate process and fulfill transactions any interruptions outages or delays in the systems and infrastructures of our business our affiliates andor third parties or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures could impair the ability of our business to provide services fulfill orders andor process transactions fire flood power loss telecommunications failure hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from providing services fulfilling orders andor processing transactions while we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption if any of these adverse events were to occur it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the processing storage use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights 

in the processing of consumer transactions we receive transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are 

  

index to financial statements governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our business moreover there are federal state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing sharing use disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data specifically personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by our business the failure of us andor the various thirdparty vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage the reputation of our business discourage potential users from trying the products and services that we offer andor result in fines andor proceedings by governmental agencies andor consumers one or all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from terrorist and related security incidents as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs including coverage for acts of terrorism we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans at december 31 2008 we had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 8877 million 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at reasonable costs to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our venues to meet longterm 

  

index to financial statements increasing demand to increase entertainment value and to increase revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our venues including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our live music venue operations are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we cannot predict the extent to which any future laws or regulations will impact our operations the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex although we generally contract with a thirdparty vendor for these services at our owned andor operated venues we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty vendors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we or our thirdparty vendors will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or that we will not be held liable for violations by thirdparty vendors furthermore additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance 

we also serve alcoholic beverages at many of our venues during live music events and must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram 

  

index to financial statements shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the customer although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor customers will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us we cannot assure you that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance we must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the states in which we serve alcoholic beverages 

from time to time governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live music events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues additionally certain laws and regulations could hold us strictly jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of hazardous substance contamination at our facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites and could hold us responsible for any personal or property damage related to any contamination 

we face intense competition in the live music industry and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business segments are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current live music revenue we compete in the live music industry and within this industry we compete with other venues to book performers and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters and venue operators our competitors also compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the numbers of advertising customers event attendance ticket prices or profit margins include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements  we believe that barriers to entry into the live music promotion business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

the stagehands at some of our venues and other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements in addition our business operations at one or more of our facilities may also be interrupted as a result of labor disputes by outside unions attempting to unionize a venue even though we do not have unionized labor at that venue currently a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our produced andor promoted events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live music venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we require access to venues to generate revenue from live music events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live music venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties or equity or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live music business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we plan to continue to expand our operations through the development of live music venues and the expansion of existing live music venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

  

  

 additionally the market potential of live music venues sites cannot be precisely determined and our live music venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live music venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live music venue locations 

  

index to financial statements and for opportunities to acquire existing live music venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live music venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our revenues depend in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns for our live music events and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related souvenir merchandise and apparel during 2008 we spent approximately 45 of our revenue on marketing including advertising and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live music events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote many live music events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and souvenirs among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as food beverage and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods if we are unable to reschedule events due to poor weather we are forced to refund the tickets for those events 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live music events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents in the past military actions in iraq and other locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following past terrorism actions some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our music business the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

risks relating to our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

our stock price has fluctuated between 273 and 2563 since the spinoff in december 2005 the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and investors could lose all or part of the value of their common stock 

in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our stockholders by written consent two of our ten directors are also directors of clear channel in addition our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in 

  

index to financial statements the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and clear channel we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel clear channel will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

our obligation to indemnify under certain circumstances clear channel and its affiliates pursuant to the tax matters agreement against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the spinoff to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code could deter a change of control of us 

we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors under specified circumstances our other stockholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control and the redeemable preferred stock requires one of our subsidiaries to offer to repurchase the redeemable preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—redeemable preferred stock 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition our redeemable preferred stock and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility include restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline as of december 31 2008 there were 780 million shares of our common stock outstanding excluding treasury shares 907000 shares of common stock issuable from currently exercisable options at a weighted average exercise price of 1781 per share and a warrant to purchase 500000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of 1373 

  

index to financial statements we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of the notes 

conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by our board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

risks relating to our separation from clear channel 

the separation could result in significant tax liability to our initial public stockholders 

clear channel received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its stockholders qualifies as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code although a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service generally is binding on the internal revenue service if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect we will not be able to rely on the ruling 

furthermore the internal revenue service will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the ruling is based upon representations by clear channel that these conditions have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling therefore in addition to obtaining the ruling from the internal revenue service clear channel made it a condition to the separation that clear channel obtain a legal opinion that the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on the ruling as to matters covered by the ruling in addition the opinion is based on among other things certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by clear channel and us which if incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and the internal revenue service or the courts may not agree with the opinion 

notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position our initial public 

  

index to financial statements stockholders could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general our initial public stockholders could be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 

the separation could result in significant taxrelated liabilities to us 

as discussed above notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position clear channel could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the distribution otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the distribution were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 

although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12 relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel for a more detailed discussion of the tax matters agreement between clear channel and us 

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 

each member of the clear channel consolidated group which includes clear channel our company and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel has recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel is unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 12 relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel 

  

index to financial statements risks relating to the pending merger with ticketmaster 

failure to complete the merger with ticketmaster may negatively impact our stock price and financial results 

the merger is subject to a number of closing conditions and there is no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the merger will be satisfied the pendency of the merger may cause a disruption to our business and a distraction of our management and employees from daytoday operations as matters related to the merger may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to us if the merger is not completed we will be subject to several risks including 1 the current market price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that the merger will occur and a failure to complete the merger could result in a negative perception of us by the stock market and a resulting decline in the market price of our common stock 2 we may be required to pay ticketmaster a termination fee of 15 million in addition to the reimbursement of certain ticketmaster transaction expenses if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances and 3 we would not realize any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the merger if the merger is not completed these risks may materialize and materially adversely affect our business financial results financial condition and stock price 

the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or realized at all or may take longer to realize than expected 

the merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently with principal offices in two distinct locations due to legal restrictions we have conducted only limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the two companies delays in this process could adversely affect the combined company’s business financial results financial condition and stock price even if we are able to integrate our business operations successfully there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time 

the trading price of shares of our common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of shares of our common stock before the merger 

if we complete the merger holders of ticketmaster common stock will become holders of a majority of our common stock in addition our business and results of operations will increase and change as a result of the combination of the two companies the results of our operations as well as the trading price of our common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock including the risks faced by ticketmaster’s business additional disclosure regarding our pending merger with ticketmaster the pro forma financial impact of the merger and other related matters will be set forth in a proxy statement to be filed with the sec in connection with the merger 

the merger will result in changes to our board and management that may affect our strategy

 our separation from clear channel 

we were formed through acquisitions of various entertainment businesses and assets by our predecessors in august 2000 clear channel acquired our entertainment business in august 2005 we were incorporated in our current form as a delaware corporation to own substantially all of the entertainment business of clear channel in december 2005 the separation of the business previously conducted by clear channel’s live entertainment segment and sports representation business and the distribution by clear channel of all of our common stock to its stockholders was completed in a tax free spinoff following our separation from clear channel we became a separate publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” 

basis of presentation 

as a result of the separation we recognized the par value and additional paidin capital in connection with the issuance of our common stock in exchange for the net assets contributed at that time and we began accumulating retained deficits and currency translation adjustments upon completion of the separation beginning on december 21 2005 our consolidated financial statements include all accounts of live nation and our majorityowned subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary

goodwill impairment 

in accordance with financial accounting standards board or fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  or statement 142 we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october 1 using a twostep process the first step used to screen for potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the second step used to measure the amount of any potential impairment compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill we also test goodwill for impairment in other periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

in september 2008 in connection with the sale of our noncore events business which has been classified as discontinued operations we reviewed the carrying value of our noncore events assets based on an indicator that future operating cash flows may not support their carrying value based on expected sales proceeds it was determined that those assets were impaired since the estimated undiscounted cash flows based on expected sales proceeds associated with those assets were less than their carrying value as a result we recorded a 130 million goodwill impairment charge related to the goodwill for this noncore events business as a component of operating expenses in discontinued operations we are not continuing to operate in the noncore events business 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 while we were performing our annual impairment test as of october 1 we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization since a favorable result from an october 1 test would not have prevented a second impairment test at december 31 2008 a single impairment test was completed as of december 31 2008 based upon the results of this impairment test that was performed we 

  

index to financial statements recorded impairment charges of 1892 million and 807 million related to our north american music and artist nation reporting units respectively which represented all of the remaining goodwill previously recorded for these reporting units 

the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates in performing the first step of our impairment analysis we developed a consolidated fair value using a market multiple methodology which was then allocated to the individual reporting units based upon the discounted cash flows developed for each reporting unit in performing the second step of our impairment analysis for the reporting units that failed the step one test we developed fair values using the discounted cash flows methodology 

loss gain on sale of operating assets

ticketing depreciation and amortization expense increased 28 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to higher depreciation expense related to our website development 

the increase in the operating loss for ticketing was primarily a result of higher salary consultant and maintenance expenses partially offset by increased ticketrelated revenue and sponsorships from our internal ticketing operations 

  

index to financial statements other results of operations 

our other operating results were as follows 

 

  

 year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

other revenue decreased 541 million or 38 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily as a result of a decline in revenue from our united kingdom theater operations as a result of reduced participation in theatrical productions and touring theatrical shows and the sale of our interest in the production of phantom the las vegas spectacular in the first quarter of 2007 

other direct operating expenses decreased 461 million or 64 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to lower direct operating expenses from our united kingdom theater operations due to reduced productions and the sale of our interest in the production of phantom the las vegas spectacular  

other selling general and administrative expenses decreased 132 million or 24 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to higher overhead costs in 2007 related to businesses that we have sold or are no longer operating 

loss on sale of operating assets was 01 million during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 50 million during the same period of the prior year in 2007 we recorded a loss on the sale of our interest in the production of phantom the las vegas spectacular  which was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an arenarace track in leicestershire england 

the improvement in operating income in our other operations was primarily due to the elimination of less profitable noncore assets and a reduced loss on sale of operating assets related to assets sold in 2007 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

other revenue decreased 367 million or 21 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the sale of portions of our sports representation business assets in 2006 and the sale of donington park in the united kingdom these decreases were partially offset by increases in our united kingdom theater operations driven by strong results from our production of chicago and increased rental merchandise and concession revenue due to an increase in the number of events and related attendance driven by shows such as wicked  the producers and mamma mia  

other direct operating expenses decreased 212 million or 23 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the sale of portions of our sports representation 

  

index to financial statements business assets the sale of donington park and a decline in writeoffs and costs related to certain dvdcd production and distribution projects these decreases were partially offset by the strong results from our united kingdom theater operations noted above 

other selling general and administrative expenses decreased 150 million or 22 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the sale of portions of our sports representation business assets and the sale of donington park 

other depreciation and amortization expense decreased 82 million or 44 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to an impairment of 91 million recorded during 2006 primarily related to a theater development project and also due to the sale of donington park 

other loss on sale of operating assets increased 159 million during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the gain in the same period of the prior year due to the loss recorded in 2007 on the sale of our interest in the production of phantom the las vegas spectacular  partially offset by the gain on the sale of an arenarace track in leicestershire england as compared to the gain on the sale of a portion of our sports representation business assets recorded in 2006 

overall the reduction in operating income to a slight operating loss in our other operations in 2007 was primarily due to the elimination of the gain on sale of operating assets related to assets sold in 2006 and the recording of the net loss on sale of assets sold in 2007

 liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is currently managed on a worldwide basis our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements and capital expenditures while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily acquisition related our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 1997 million and current and longterm debt of 8857 million at december 31 2008 and cash and cash equivalents of 3390 million and current and longterm debt of 8226 million at december 31 2007 these debt balances do not include our outstanding redeemable preferred stock 

  

index to financial statements our available cash and cash equivalents is held in accounts managed by thirdparty financial institutions and consists of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash the invested cash is invested in interestbearing funds managed by thirdparty financial institutions these funds generally invest in direct obligations of the government of the united states cash held in operating accounts in many cases exceeds the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic insurance limits while we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents however we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our ability to issue additional equity may be constrained because the issuance of additional stock may cause the distribution to be taxable under section 355e of the internal revenue code and under our tax matters agreement with clear channel we would be required to indemnify clear channel against the tax if any we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents market conditions and the tax matters agreement 

the lenders under our revolving credit facility and counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements discussed below consist of banks and other thirdparty financial institutions while we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders and counterparties will be unable to fund their commitments as required we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets should an individual lender default on its obligations the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments should any counterparty to our interest rate swap agreements default on its obligations we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default 

we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue in advance of the event in our owned andor operated venues which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses along with the remainder of the artist fees at or after the event we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and for cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions repurchase stock and finance revenuegenerating capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses an example of seasonal effects includes our north american music and international music segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year

capital expenditures 

venue operations is a capital intensive business requiring continual investment in our existing venues in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

  

index to financial statements we categorize capital outlays into maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and to a lesser extent capital expenditures related to information systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures generally relate to the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to add revenue andor improve operating income capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation 

our capital expenditures consisted of the following 

 

 revenue generating capital expenditures for 2008 increased significantly from the prior year primarily due to the development and renovation of various venues including o 2 dublin in ireland house of blues clubs in houston and boston the hollywood palladium amg venue expansions in sheffield and leeds as well as for our ticketing rollout the decrease in maintenance capital expenditures in 2008 as compared to the prior year is due to various projects in 2007 including the rollout of a new financial software system office building moves for a few locations and information technology costs for hardware and software including the buildout of a new data center 

revenue generating capital expenditures for 2007 increased significantly from the prior year due to the development and renovation of various venues including o 2 dublin in ireland the house of blues club in dallas and the acquisition of an additional portion of the land on which we annually stage our reading festival in the united kingdom in addition we invested additional capital in transforming our venues into wired studios to expand on the distribution opportunities of the live concert experience

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and some of the venues used in our music and other operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into construction related commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

  

index to financial statements the scheduled maturities of our outstanding longterm debt future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditures commitments as of december 31 2008 are as follows

minimum rentals of 1092 million to be received in years 2009 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table

 operating activities 

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

cash used in operations was 528 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to cash provided by operations of 498 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 1026 million increase in cash used in operations resulted primarily from advances related to entering into certain artist rights agreements and changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the timing size and number of events for upcoming periods the accounts primarily affected by this event timing were accrued eventrelated expenses which decreased as compared to an increase last year and resulted in a decrease in cash used in operating activities partially offset by prepaid eventrelated expenses which increased less than last year and resulted in a decrease in cash used in operating activities 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

cash provided by operations was 498 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 176 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 322 million increase in cash provided by operations primarily resulted from changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the number and size of events for upcoming periods accounts receivable decreased rather than increased due to the timing and number of events during 2007 as compared to 2006 and the timing of cash collections resulting in an increase to cash provided by operations in addition we received more deferred revenue and paid less accrued eventrelated expenses during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting in an increase to cash provided by operations conversely the other assets increase was higher primarily due to advances under longterm artist rights agreements resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operating activities finally we paid more prepaid eventrelated expenses during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operating activities these changes in eventrelated operating accounts are impacted by the timing size and number of events related to music activity in the period 

investing activities 

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

cash used in investing activities was 676 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 1411 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 735 million decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher proceeds received in 2008 from the sale of our motor sports events and north american theatrical businesses as compared to proceeds received in 2007 from the sales of an arenarace track in leicestershire england an amphitheater in nashville an office building in san francisco two music theaters and seven clubs in london and our production of phantom the las vegas spectacular  additionally we used more cash in the prior year related to our acquisitions of signatures amg and hob canada as compared to the amounts used for our 2008 acquisitions partially offsetting these decreases in cash used in investing activities were higher capital expenditures and acquisitions of certain artist rights in 2008 

  

index to financial statements year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

cash used in investing activities was 1411 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 3761 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 2350 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our acquisition of hob during 2006 in addition we received higher proceeds from the divestiture of the oriental theater in chicago and our 50 interest in bic the apollo hammersmith and forum music theaters in london donington park in leicestershire england seven clubs in london an office building in san francisco the starwood amphitheater in nashville our remaining 501 interest in the production of phantom the las vegas spectacular and a club in cleveland ohio these decreases were partially offset by increases in our capital expenditures during 2007 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the development of the house of blues club in dallas the renovation of o 2 dublin in ireland the acquisition of an additional portion of the land on which we annually stage our reading festival in the united kingdom and the wiring of our venues into live studios also offsetting the decreases was an increase in cash used for investing activities primarily related to intangible assets acquired for longterm artist rights agreements 

financing activities 

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

cash provided by financing activities was 340 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 1102 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 762 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of reduced net borrowings in 2008 as compared to the same period in the prior year included in 2007 was the issuance of our 2875 convertible senior notes while 2008 included higher net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and lower term loan repayments than in 2007 additionally in 2008 we purchased stock in connection with a put option related to an artist rights agreement which used cash and therefore reduced cash provided by financing activities 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

cash provided by financing activities was 1102 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2683 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 1581 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of net payments made on our term loans and revolving credit facility partially offset by increased proceeds received from the issuance of our 2875 convertible notes during 2007 which were less than the proceeds received from the additional term loan during 2006 which was partially used to fund our acquisition of hob in 2006 

seasonality 

our north american music and international music segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and international festivals are primarily used or occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of topgrossing acts in our artist nation segment can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted 

cash flows from our north american music and international music segments typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we begin to receive payments from ticket sales still in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a risk factors—our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 804 million for the year ended december 31 2008 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2008 by 80 million as of december 31 2008 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound swedish kroner and canadian dollar this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

occasionally we will use forward currency contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with artist fee commitments at december 31 2008 we had forward currency contracts outstanding with a notional amount of 101 million 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 8857 million total debt outstanding as of december 31 2008 of the total amount taking into consideration existing interest rate hedges we have 6149 million of fixedrate debt and 2708 million of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2008 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 07 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2008 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

at december 31 2008 we have four interest rate swap agreements that are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes which include swaps and combinations of interest rate caps and floors with a total notional amount of 3125 million to effectively convert a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis two of these agreements expire in march 2009 and one in september 2010 one of these swap agreements has a forward swap with a notional amount of 1625 million effective march 31 2009 which expires march 31 2011 the fair value of these agreements at december 31 2008 was a liability of 109 million these agreements were put in place to eliminate or reduce the variability of a portion of the cash flows from the interest payments related to our senior secured credit facility the terms of our senior secured credit facility required that an interest rate swap be put in place for at least 50 of the original 325 million senior term loan and for at least three years 

as part of the acquisition of amg we have an interest rate swap agreement with an 184 million aggregate notional amount that effectively converts a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis this agreement expires in january 2015 additionally in connection with the financing of the redevelopment of o 2 dublin in ireland we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 226 million that expires in december 2013 these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

in july 2007 we issued 2200 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 beginning with the period commencing on july 20 2014 and ending on january 14 2015 and for each of the interest periods commencing 

  

index to financial statements thereafter we will pay contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes during the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120 of the principal amount of the notes the contingent interest payable per note will equal 025 per year of the average trading price of such note during the applicable five tradingday reference period payable in arrears

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or statement 159 statement 159 allows entities to voluntarily choose at specified election dates to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities as well as certain nonfinancial instruments that are similar to financial instruments at fair value or the fair value option the election is made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis and is irrevocable if the fair value option is elected for an instrument statement 159 specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument will be reported in earnings we adopted statement 159 on january 1 2008 and determined that we would not elect to measure any of our eligible financial instruments at fair value under the provisions of this standard

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 

  

index to financial statements the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable longlived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures for intangibles related to artist rights the company uses assumptions about future revenue and operating income for the rights acquired these projections are based on information about the artists’ past results and expectations about future results our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill for impairment at least annually to determine the fair value of our reporting units the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 

the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units we use both market multiples and discounted cash flow projections in developing fair values inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates actual results could differ from such estimates 

  

index to financial statements revenue recognition 

revenue from the promotion and production of an event is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the performance occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

revenue from our ticketing operations primarily consists of convenience and order processing fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold and is recorded on a net basis net of the face value of the ticket for tickets sold for events at our owned andor operated venues this revenue is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue for these ticket fees collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs these fees will be shared between our ticketing segment and the north american music segment for tickets sold for events for thirdparty venues this revenue is recognized at the time of the sale and is recorded by our ticketing segment 

for multiple element contracts we allocate consideration to the multiple elements based on the relative fair values of each separate element which are determined based on prices charged for such items when sold on a stand alone basis in cases where there is no objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of certain elements in an arrangement we account for the transaction as a single unit of accounting per the requirements of eitf 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction to revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

stockbased compensation 

we follow the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or statement 123r in accordance with statement 123r we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates noncash compensation expense could be materially impacted 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by 

  

index to financial statements valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  or fin 48 on january 1 2007 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

  

 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues prior period calculations have been revised to conform to the current period presentation

live music industry 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production according to pollstar  north american gross concert revenue increased from 31 billion in 2005 to 39 billion in 2007 a compound annual growth rate of approximately 12 excluding the impact of acquisitions in the 2005 to 2007 period our north american music international music and global artists revenue comprised primarily of gross concert related revenue increased from 24 billion to 31 billion a compound annual growth rate of 16 we believe this growth was primarily due to increasing ticket prices for topgrossing acts and the desire of these acts such as madonna the rolling stones and u2 to tour 

typically to initiate live entertainment events or tours booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with performers to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services promoters earn revenue primarily from the sale of tickets performers are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and including the right to offset lower performing shows with higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

  

index to financial statements for music tours one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances promoters in conjunction with performers managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues if not provided by booking agents and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenue from concessions merchandise sponsorships parking and premium seats for the events they host venue operators typically receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as well as percentages of total concession sales from the vendors and percentages of total merchandise sales from the merchandisers

live theater consists mainly of productions of existing musicals and dramatic works and the development of new works while musicals require greater investments of time and capital than dramatic productions they are more likely to become touring theatrical shows producers of touring theatrical shows first acquire the rights to works from their owners who typically receive royalty payments in return producers then assemble casts hire directors and arrange for the design and construction of sets and costumes producers also arrange transportation and schedule shows with local presenters local presenters who generally operate or have relationships with venues provide all local services such as selling tickets hiring local personnel buying advertising and paying fixed guarantees to producers presenters then have the right to recover the guarantees plus their local costs from ticket revenue presenters and producers typically share any remaining show profit in order to secure exclusive touring rights investors may take equity positions in broadway new york or west end london shows touring rights are generally granted to investors for three to four years

specialized motor sports events make up a growing segment of the live entertainment industry this growth has resulted from additional demand in existing markets and new demand in markets including europe where arenas and stadiums have been built the increasing popularity of specialized motor sports over the last several years has coincided with the increased popularity of other professional motor sports events such as professional auto racing including the national association for stock car auto racing or nascar and the indy racing league or irl a number of events are also broadcast domestically and internationally

 competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality entertainment products and enhanced fan experiences from music concerts touring theatrical performances and specialized motor sports events we believe that our primary strengths include 

 

  

  

  

 although we believe that our entertainment products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition financial marketing service support technical and other resources 

north american music international music and global artists in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from promoters as well as from certain artists that promote their own concerts we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

our main competitors in the live music industry include anschutz entertainment group jam productions and palace sports  entertainment in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe anschutz entertainment group operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets and have access to other sports and entertainment assets as well as greater financial resources and brand recognition which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in markets where we own andor operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region in markets where we do not own or operate venues we compete with other 

  

index to financial statements venues and promoters for popular tours consequently touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours our main competitors in venue management include smg and anschutz entertainment group in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe some of our competitors in venue management have a greater number of venues in certain markets as well as greater financial resources and brand recognition in those markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorship consists of local sports teams which often offer state of the art venues and strong local media packages additionally our competitors locally can include festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

global digital in the online environment we compete with other website companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites our main competitors for online event sites include ticketmaster and secondary ticketing companies such as stubhub 

global theater  in the markets in which we present theatrical performances we compete with other presenters to obtain presentation arrangements with venues and performing arts organizations including markets with more than one venue suitable for presenting a touring or other theatrical show we compete with other new york and londonbased production companies for the rights to produce particular shows as a producer of broadway and west end shows we compete with producers of other theatrical performances for box office sales talent and theater space as the producer of a touring show we compete with producers of other touring or other theatrical performances to book the production in desirable presentation markets 

our main competitors in the global theatrical industry include nederlander producing company of america mirvish productions the shubert organization the walt disney company and jujamcyn theaters in north america in europe our competitors include cameron mackintosh really useful theater group and ambassadors theatre group as well as smaller regional players some of our competitors in the theatrical industry have more broadway show interests than we do in new york city from which most north american theatrical touring productions originate in addition these competitors may have significantly greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources which could enable them to strengthen their competitive positions against us 

other our main competitors in the specialized motor sports industry are primarily smaller regional promoters on a broader level in the united states we compete against other outdoor motor sports such as nascar some of our competitors in the specialized motor sports industry enjoy stronger brand recognition and larger revenue in the motor sports industry than we do and may have greater financial and other resources enabling them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

 we believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food including in some cases requirements relating to the temperature of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the united kingdom’s disability discrimination act 1995 or the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to patrons and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time state and federal governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live entertainment events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

intellectual property 

we create own and distribute intellectual property worldwide it is our practice to protect out trademarks brands copyrights patents and other original and acquired works ancillary goods and services our trademarks include among others the word marks “live nation” house of blues” and “the fillmore” as well as the live nation house of blues and the fillmore logos we have registered our most significant trademarks in many foreign countries we believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brandbuilding efforts and the marketing of our services we cannot predict however whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we had approximately 4700 fulltime employees including 3500 domestic and 1200 international employees of which approximately 4600 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 100 were employed in our corporate area 

  

index to financial statements our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also from time to time employ parttime andor seasonal employees at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 7500 seasonal andor parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we have employed as many as 17600 seasonal employees the stagehands at some of our venues and the actors musicians and others involved in some of our business operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our produced andor presented events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our leverage our convertible notes our business our common stock and our separation from clear channel the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks associated with our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

as of december 31 2007 our total indebtedness for borrowed money including our redeemable preferred stock was approximately 8626 million our available borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility at that date was approximately 1843 million with sublimits up to 2350 million available for letters of credit at december 31 2007 outstanding letters of credit were approximately 457 million we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to service our debt preferred stock and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist rights payments and capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control 

as of december 31 2007 approximately 363 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2008 222 million is due in the aggregate for 2009 and 2010 1255 million is due in the aggregate for 2011 and 2012 and 6786 million is due thereafter see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—contractual obligations and commitments—firm commitments 

our redeemable preferred stock bears an annual dividend rate of 13 or 52 million annually and is subject to financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants applicable to our senior secured credit facility if we default under any of these covenants we will have to pay additional dividends in addition 

  

index to financial statements as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 11 billion in operating lease agreements of which approximately 743 million is due in 2008 and 691 million is due in 2009 

our ability to service our debt preferred stock and lease obligations and to fund potential acquisitions artist rights payments and capital expenditures for venue construction expansion or renovation will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs we cannot predict the impact to our ability to access additional capital in light of the current uncertainty in the credit market if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity we may be subject to limitations on the assets we can sell under the terms of the tax matters agreement with clear channel in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility other future debt and our preferred stock may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives 

these measures might also be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt redeemable preferred stock or lease service obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all as a result the inability to meet our debt redeemable preferred stock or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations any such defaults could materially harm our financial condition and liquidity 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility our preferred stock designations and certain of our other indebtedness impose restrictions on us that limit the discretion of management in operating our business and that in turn could impair our ability to meet our obligations under our debt 

the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility our preferred stock designations and certain of our other indebtedness include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition our senior secured credit facility and preferred stock designations include other restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of the governing documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable if we default under any of 

  

index to financial statements the covenants applicable to our preferred stock the holder of our preferred stock may be entitled to elect a director of one of our subsidiaries and we will have to pay additional dividends 

these covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs furthermore they may restrict our ability to expand to pursue our business strategies and otherwise to conduct our business our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply a breach of these covenants could result in a default under our debt if there were an event of default under our outstanding indebtedness and the obligations thereunder accelerated our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy 

we will depend on the cash flows of our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our obligations 

we will rely on distributions and advances from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment requirements under our obligations if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or otherwise make payments to us we may not be able to make debt service payments on our obligations we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries our operating cash flows and consequently our ability to service our debt is therefore principally dependent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings and their distributions of those earnings to us and may also be dependent upon loans advances or other payments of funds to us by those subsidiaries our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay any amount due pursuant to our obligations or to make any funds available for that purpose in addition the ability of our subsidiaries to provide funds to us is subject to restrictions under our senior secured credit facility and the outstanding preferred stock of our subsidiary and may be subject to the terms of such subsidiaries’ future indebtedness as well as the availability of sufficient surplus funds under applicable law 

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring business could result in the loss of key tours 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to post a letter of credit or advance cash to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our revolving credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted 

risks relating to our 2875 convertible senior notes 

we may not have the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of the notes or to pay the cash payable upon a conversion if we make the net share settlement election or we may otherwise be restricted from making such payments which may increase note holders’ credit risk 

in july 2007 we issued 220 million of 2875 convertible senior notes due 2027 in a private placement in the united states to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 as amended on july 15 2014 july 15 2017 and july 15 2022 or in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes holders may require us to repurchase their notes at a price of 100 of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and additional amounts to the repurchase date in addition at any time on or prior to june 15 2027 we may irrevocably elect net share settlement of the notes and thereafter we will be required to make a cash payment of up to 1000 for each 1000 in principal amount of notes converted however it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds available at such time to make the required repurchase or settlement of converted notes in addition some of our existing financing agreements contain and any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our 

  

index to financial statements indebtedness could contain provisions prohibiting the repurchase of the notes under certain circumstances or could provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under that agreement restrict our ability to make cash payments upon conversion of the notes or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make funds available to us for that purpose if any agreement governing our indebtedness prohibits or otherwise restricts us from repurchasing the notes or making the cash payment upon conversion when we become obligated to do so we could seek the consent of the lenders to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion or attempt to refinance the other debt if we do not obtain such a consent or refinance the debt we would not be permitted to repurchase the notes or settle the conversion without potentially causing a default under the other debt our failure to repurchase tendered notes or to pay any cash payable on a conversion would constitute an event of default under the indenture which might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness  

the additional shares of common stock payable on any notes converted in connection with specified corporate transactions may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transactions 

if certain specified corporate transactions occur on or prior to july 15 2014 we will under certain circumstances increase the conversion rate on notes converted in connection with the specified corporate transaction by a number of additional shares of common stock the number of additional shares of common stock will be determined based on the date on which the specified corporate transaction becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction the additional shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes in connection with a specified corporate transaction may not adequately compensate holders of notes for any loss they may experience as a result of such specified corporate transaction furthermore holders of notes will not receive the additional consideration payable as a result of the increase in the conversion rate until the effective date of the specified corporate transaction or later which could be a significant period of time after holders of notes have tendered their notes for conversion if the specified corporate transaction occurs after july 15 2014 or if the price paid per share of our common stock in the specified corporate transaction is less than the common stock price at the date of issuance of the notes or above a specified price there will be no increase in the conversion rate in addition in certain circumstances upon a change of control arising from our acquisition by a public company we may elect to adjust the conversion rate and if we so elect holders of notes will not be entitled to the increase in the conversion rate determined as described above 

the conditional conversion feature of the notes could result in holders of notes receiving less than the value of the common stock for which a note would otherwise be convertible 

prior to july 15 2027 the notes are convertible for shares of our common stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met if the specific conditions for conversion are not met holders of notes will not be able to convert their notes and they may not be able to receive the value of the common stock or cash and common stock as applicable for which the notes would otherwise be convertible 

upon conversion of the notes holders of notes may receive less proceeds than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after the exercise of the conversion right 

if we elect to settle conversions other than solely in shares of common stock including by making a net share settlement election the conversion value that holders of notes will receive upon conversion of their notes are in part determined subject to certain exceptions by the average of the last reported sale prices of our common stock for the 20 trading days beginning on the second trading day immediately following the day the notes are tendered for conversion or if tendered within the 20 days leading up to the maturity date or a specified redemption date beginning on the fifth day following the maturity date or the redemption date accordingly if the price of our common stock decreases after holder of notes tender their notes for conversion the conversion value they will receive may be adversely affected 

  

index to financial statements the conversion rate of the notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events 

the conversion rate of the notes is subject to adjustment only for certain specified events including but not limited to the issuance of stock dividends on our common stock the issuance of certain rights or warrants subdivisions combinations distributions of capital stock indebtedness or assets cash dividends and certain issuer tender or exchange offers however the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events such as an issuance of common stock for cash or acquisition that may adversely affect the trading price of the notes or the common stock or for a thirdparty tender offer 

risks relating to our business 

our live entertainment business is highly sensitive to public tastes and dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live entertainment events and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our ability to generate revenue from our entertainment operations is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform live entertainment content any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists touring theatrical performances specialized motor sports talent and other performers could limit our ability to generate revenue in particular there are a limited number of artists that can headline a major north american or global tour or who can sell out larger venues including many of our amphitheaters if those key artists do not continue to tour or if we are unable to secure the rights to their future tours then our business would be adversely affected 

in addition we typically book our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agree to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any operating income therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or a performer cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned as well as foregone revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover our losses if a performer cancels a tour furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our operating results and profitability 

we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results have been adversely affected by among other things increased cost of artists and a decline in ticket sales we incurred net losses of approximately 119 million 314 million and 1306 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively we may face reduced demand for our live entertainment events and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours and theatrical productions tour cancellations capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial 

  

index to financial statements performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals primarily occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters 

 

 we may be adversely affected by a general deterioration in economic conditions which could affect consumer and corporate spending and therefore significantly adversely impact our operating results 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income in addition during the most recent economic slowdown in the united states many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue the risks associated with our businesses become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment events 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seats sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and souvenir sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over additional terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

loss of our key promoters management and other personnel could result in the loss of key tours and negatively impact our business 

the live music business is uniquely dependent upon personal relationships as promoters and executives within the live music companies such as ours leverage their existing network of relationships with artists agents and managers in order to secure the rights to the live music tours and events which are critical to our success due to the importance of those industry contacts to our business the loss of any of our promoters officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations although we have entered into longterm agreements with many of those individuals to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts 

  

index to financial statements doing business in foreign countries creates risks not found in doing business in the united states 

our international operations accounted for approximately 33 of our revenue in 2007 the risks involved in foreign operations that could result in losses against which we are not insured include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we may incur substantial tax liabilities if we repatriate any of the cash generated by our international operations back to the united states due to our current inability to recognize any foreign tax credits that would be associated with such repatriation we currently expect to repatriate some of the cash generated by our international operations and to use certain of our substantial net operating losses to offset associated tax liabilities we are not currently in a position to recognize any tax assets in the united states that are the result of payments of income or withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenue from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the year ended december 31 2007 our international operations accounted for approximately 33 of our revenue although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound and the euro in 2007 and 2006 we experienced foreign exchange rate net gains of 45 million and 32 million respectively for those periods which had a positive effect on our operating income while in 2005 we experienced a foreign exchange rate net loss of 13 million which had a negative effect on our operating income see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk—foreign currency risk 

we may enter into future acquisitions and longterm artist rights arrangements and take certain actions in connection with such transactions that could affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our growth strategy we expect to review acquisition prospects that would offer growth opportunities we also anticipate entering into longterm arrangements with certain artists under which we would acquire the rights to certain musicrelated activities including touring merchandising recording online fan clubs filmdvd and other rights in the event of future acquisitions or artist rights arrangements we could 

 

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

 such actions by us could harm our results from operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses a significant portion of our recent growth has been attributable to acquisitions including among others our acquisitions of hob entertainment inc or hob musictoday cpi and of an equity interest in amg we may be unable to identify other suitable targets for further acquisition or make further acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals acquisitions involve risks including those associated with 

 

  

  

  

  

 we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union and the united kingdom competition commission with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in other jurisdictions also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

  

index to financial statements in addition restrictions contained in the tax matters agreement between us and clear channel the credit agreement for the senior secured credit facility and the terms of our subsidiary’s preferred stock restrict our ability to make acquisitions 

certain of our new or expanded business lines including ticketing and artist rights arrangements may not develop as currently anticipated causing an adverse impact on our financial performance 

we are currently in the process of expanding our operations to encompass musicrelated businesses beyond the live music event these include launching a fullscale inhouse ticketing operation which is anticipated to be operational by the beginning of 2009 as well as continuing to invest in longterm rights arrangements with key artists in each of these and other new or expanding business lines we currently anticipate incurring costs to build infrastructure making advances to artists and otherwise investing in these new businesses if these businesses do not develop as currently anticipated either due to our inability to execute on our strategic plans or as a result of other factors our profitability could be negatively impacted 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live entertainment events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live entertainment events causing a decrease in our revenue 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live entertainment events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live entertainment events at any of our venues or venues that we rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events causing a decrease in our revenue we are currently subject to wrongful death claims as well as other litigation while we maintain insurance polices that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from the terrorist and related security incidents on and after september 11 2001 in the united states as well as the more recent terrorist attacks in madrid and london as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs including coverage for acts of terrorism we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near major cities and which hold events typically attended by a large number of fans at december 31 2007 we had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 9150 million 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others may result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

in addition under our live nation artists platform we enter into various agreements with artists from time to time including longterm artist rights arrangements the profitability of those arrangements depends upon those artists’ willingness and ability to continue performing and we may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at reasonable costs to adequately protect us against the death disability or other failure of such artists to continue engaging in revenuegenerating activities under those agreements 

  

index to financial statements we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability artists and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenue depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our venues to meet longterm increasing demand to increase entertainment value and to increase revenue we frequently have a number of significant capital projects underway numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our venues including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our live entertainment venue operations are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements we cannot predict the extent to which any future laws or regulations will impact our operations the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex although we generally contract with a thirdparty vendor for these services at our operated venues we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty vendors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we or our thirdparty vendors will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or that we will not be held liable for violations by thirdparty vendors furthermore additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance 

we also serve alcoholic beverages at many of our venues during live entertainment events and must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us we cannot assure you that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance we must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the states in which we serve alcoholic beverages 

from time to time state and federal governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live entertainment events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues additionally certain laws and regulations could hold us strictly jointly and severally responsible for the remediation of hazardous substance contamination at our facilities or at thirdparty waste disposal sites and could hold us responsible for any personal or property damage related to any contamination 

we face intense competition in the live entertainment industry and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business segments are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current live entertainment revenue we compete in the live entertainment industries and within such industries we compete with other venues to book performers and in the markets in which we promote music concerts we face competition from other promoters as well as from certain performers who promote their own concerts our competitors also compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or entertainment venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenue the numbers of advertising customers event attendance ticket prices or profit margins include 

 

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

  

 we believe that barriers to entry into the live entertainment promotion business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

the stagehands at some of our venues and the actors musicians and others involved in some of our business operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our produced andor presented events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live entertainment venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we require access to venues to generate revenue from live entertainment events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live entertainment venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties or equity or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live entertainment business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

index to financial statements we plan to continue to expand our operations through the development of live entertainment venues and the expansion of existing live entertainment venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

  

  

 additionally the market potential of live entertainment venues sites cannot be precisely determined and our live entertainment venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live entertainment venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live entertainment venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live entertainment venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to or maintain the number of our live entertainment venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our revenues depend in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns for our live entertainment events and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related souvenir merchandise and apparel during 2007 we spent approximately 58 of our revenue on marketing including advertising and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenue or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live entertainment events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote many live entertainment events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and souvenirs among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to the next available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as food beverage and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods if we are unable to reschedule events due to poor weather we are forced to refund the tickets for those events 

increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly affect our results of operations 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended require compliance with corporate governance and securities disclosure requirements and require an ongoing review of our internal control procedures these requirements could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers in addition director and officer liability insurance for public companies like us has become more difficult and more expensive to obtain and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur higher costs to obtain coverage that is satisfactory to us and our officers or directors we continue to evaluate and monitor regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude or additional costs we may incur as a result 

if in any year we are unable to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer 

  

index to financial statements section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the united states securities laws to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting to comply with this statute we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules during the course of annual testing our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remediated in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanesoxley act if our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal control investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and our stock price may suffer our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live entertainment events which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents of september 11 2001 military actions in iraq and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following september 11 2001 some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our music business and many people did not travel to new york city which caused us to experience lower attendance levels at our theatrical performances playing on broadway in new york city and adversely affected our theatrical business the occurrence of the 2005 terrorist attacks in london england also caused us to experience lower attendance levels at our theatrical performances playing on the west end in london the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business 

risks relating to our common stock 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

our stock price has fluctuated between 926 and 2563 since the spinoff in december 2005 the market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

index to financial statements   

  

  

  

 in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and investors could lose all or part of the value of their common stock 

in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that shareholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of our common stock 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our shareholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for shareholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our shareholders by written consent two of our eleven directors are also directors of clear channel in addition our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or 

  

index to financial statements vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and clear channel we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel clear channel will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as our shareholder by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

our obligation to indemnify under certain circumstances clear channel and its affiliates pursuant to the tax matters agreement against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the spinoff to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code could deter a change of control of us 

we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors under specified circumstances our other shareholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control and the preferred stock requires one of our subsidiaries to offer to repurchase the preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—redeemable preferred stock 

we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock which could affect its market price 

we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth development and expansion of our business accordingly we do not intend to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future the declaration payment and amount of future dividends if any will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors including our financial condition results of operations cash flow from operations current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law in addition our preferred stock and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facility include restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends without meeting certain financial ratios and obtaining the consent of the lenders accordingly holders of common stock will not receive cash payments on their investment and the market price may be adversely affected 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

we have a large number of shares of common stock outstanding and available for resale beginning at various points in time in the future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the possibility that these sales may occur could cause the market price for our common stock to decline as of december 31 2007 there were 74893005 shares of our common stock outstanding as of december 31 2007 there were 62000 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of 1135 per share 

  

index to financial statements we continually explore acquisition opportunities consistent with our strategy these acquisitions may involve the payment of cash the incurrence of debt or the issuance of common stock or other securities any such issuance could be at a valuation lower than the trading price of our common stock at the time the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our common stock the hedging or arbitrage could in turn affect the trading prices of the notes 

conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may affect our per share results and the trading price of our common stock 

the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders issuances of stock on conversion may also affect our per share results of operations any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

we can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval which could materially adversely affect the rights of common stockholders 

our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue “blank check” preferred stock the designation number voting powers preferences and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by our board of directors our subsidiaries may also issue additional shares of preferred stock accordingly the board of directors has the authority without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the common stockholders or the market value of the common stock 

risks relating to our separation from clear channel 

we have a short operating history as a separate publiclytraded company and our historical combined and consolidated financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

in december 2005 we were spunoff from clear channel and therefore we have minimal operating history as a separate publiclytraded company the historical consolidated and combined financial information included in this form 10k for years prior to 2006 does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily a result of the following factors 

 

  

   

index to financial statements  the separation could result in significant tax liability to our initial public shareholders 

clear channel received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its shareholders qualifies as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code although a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service generally is binding on the internal revenue service if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect we will not be able to rely on the ruling 

furthermore the internal revenue service will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the ruling is based upon representations by clear channel that these conditions have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling therefore in addition to obtaining the ruling from the internal revenue service clear channel made it a condition to the separation that clear channel obtain an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp that the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on the ruling as to matters covered by the ruling in addition the opinion is based on among other things certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by clear channel and us which if incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and the internal revenue service or the courts may not agree with the opinion 

notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position our initial public shareholders could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general our initial public shareholders could be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 

the separation could result in significant taxrelated liabilities to us 

as discussed above notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position clear channel could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the distribution otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the distribution were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 

  

index to financial statements although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 10 relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel for a more detailed discussion of the tax matters agreement between clear channel and us 

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 

each member of the clear channel consolidated group which includes clear channel our company and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel has recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel is unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data—note 10 relatedparty transactions—relationship with clear channel

our effective tax rate is 645 for 2006 compared to an effective tax rate of 89 in 2005 our effective tax rate for 2006 was impacted by valuation allowances recorded against increases in deferred tax assets related to impairments recorded during the year effects of tax reserves 

the negative effective tax rate in 2005 was due primarily to a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2005 and other nondeductible expenses incurred this effective tax rate represents net tax expense of 372 million and 615 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the net decrease in tax expense is primarily attributable to increases in taxable income and a reduction in deferred tax expense due to a smaller valuation allowance adjustment in 2006 our effective tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate of 35 due primarily to nondeductible expenses state income taxes tax reserves and tax rate differences since a significant portion of our full year earnings are subject to tax in countries other than the united states

 liquidity and capital resources 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is currently managed on a worldwide basis 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 3390 million and current and longterm debt of 8226 million at december 31 2007 and cash and cash equivalents of 3139 million and current and longterm debt of 6391 million at december 31 2006 these debt balances do not include our outstanding redeemable preferred stock 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all our ability to issue additional equity may be constrained because the issuance of additional stock may cause the distribution to be taxable under section 355e of the internal revenue code and under our tax matters agreement with clear channel we would be required to indemnify clear channel against the tax if any we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents market conditions and the tax matters agreement 

we generally receive cash related to ticket revenue in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of eventrelated expenses at or after the event we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and for cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions repurchase stock and finance revenuegenerating capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our north american music and international music segments which report the majority of their revenue in the second and third quarters while our global theater segment reports the majority of its revenue in the first second and fourth quarters of the year cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “—seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with other financing alternatives to satisfy working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year

the interest rate we pay on borrowings on our senior term loans is 275 above libor the interest rate we pay on our 285 million multicurrency revolving credit facility depends on our total leverage ratio based on our current total leverage ratio our interest rate on revolving credit borrowings is 175 above libor in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the credit facility we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments as of december 31 2007 the commitment fee rate was 0375 we also are required to pay customary letter of credit fees as necessary

redeemable preferred stock 

as part of the separation one of our subsidiaries sold 200000 shares of series a voting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to thirdparty investors and issued 200000 shares of series b nonvoting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to clear channel which then sold this series b redeemable preferred stock to thirdparty investors we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the series b redeemable preferred stock sold by clear channel as of december 31 2007 we had 200000 shares of series a redeemable preferred stock and 200000 shares of series b redeemable preferred stock outstanding collectively the preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of 40 million the preferred stock accrues dividends at 13 per annum and is mandatorily redeemable on december 21 2011 although we are obligated to make an offer to repurchase the preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference in the event of a change of control 

in june 2007 we entered into an amended and restated certificate of incorporation governing the redeemable preferred stock the amended preferred stock agreement which amended and restated the certificate of incorporation to modify certain covenants and other provisions and facilitate potential future acquisitions the amended preferred stock agreement contains a covenant that requires us to pay additional dividends in the event the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to a maximum of 150 million all as defined by the amended preferred stock agreement to consolidated

at december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all redeemable preferred stock covenants we expect to remain in compliance with all of our redeemable preferred stock covenants throughout 2008 

guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 28 million and 19 million for each of the respective periods primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tour related credit cards and guarantees of bank lines of credit of a nonconsolidated affiliate and a thirdparty promoter in addition in connection with the sale of a portion of our sports representation business assets we guaranteed the performance of a third party related to an employment contract in the amount of approximately 04 and 09 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 309 million through the end of 2035 

disposal of assets 

during the year ended december 31 2007 we received 1321 million of proceeds primarily related to the sales of the oriental theater in chicago and our interest in bic the apollo hammersmith and forum midsized music venues in london donington park an arenarace track in leicestershire england seven smallsized music venues in london an office building in san francisco the starwood amphitheater in nashville our remaining 501 interest in the production of phantom the las vegas spectacular and a smallsized music venue in cleveland these proceeds are presented net of any cash included in the assets sold 

debt covenants 

the significant covenants on our multicurrency senior secured credit facility relate to total leverage senior leverage interest coverage and capital expenditures contained and defined in the credit agreement the adjusted leverage ratio covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to a maximum of 150 million all as defined by the credit agreement to consolidated earningsbeforeinteresttaxesdepreciationandamortization as defined by the credit agreement “adjusted consolidated ebitda” of less than 45 times through june 30 2008 and less than 40 times thereafter provided that aggregated subordinated indebtedness and permitted holding company indebtedness as defined by the credit agreement is less than 25 million or 60 times if greater than 25 million the senior leverage covenant which is only applicable provided aggregate subordinated indebtedness and permitted holding company indebtedness is greater than 25 million requires us to maintain a ratio of adjusted consolidated senior indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to adjusted consolidated ebitda of less than 45 times through march 31 2008 and 40 times thereafter the interest coverage covenant requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of adjusted consolidated ebitda to cash interest expense as defined by the credit agreement of 25 times the capital expenditure covenant limits annual capital expenditures as defined by the credit agreement to 110 million or less in the event that we do not meet these covenants we are considered to be in default on the credit facilities at which time the credit facilities may become immediately due this credit facility 

  

index to financial statements contains a cross default provision that would be triggered if we were to default on any other indebtedness greater than 10 million 

some of our other indebtedness includes restrictions on acquisitions and prohibit payment of ordinary dividends they also have financial covenants including minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated net interest payable minimum consolidated cash flow to consolidated debt service and maximum consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda all as defined in the applicable debt agreements 

our other indebtedness does not contain provisions that would make it a default if we were to default on our credit facilities 

other than the convertible notes we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event of default upon a change in longterm debt ratings that would have a material impact on our financial statements 

at december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all debt covenants we expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants throughout 2008 

uses of cash 

acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions especially of entities where we buy a controlling interest only the acquired entity may have cash on its balance sheet at the time of acquisition all amounts discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during 2007 we used 1243 million in cash for acquisitions in our various segments our north american music segment acquired the remaining interest in hob canada a live music company located in canada which operates or has booking rights for one amphitheater and three smallsized music venues in toronto and vancouver and acquired an interest in bamboozle llc a festival promotion company located in the united states our international music segment acquired an interest in jackie lombard a concert promotion company in france an interest in amg a live music company located in the united kingdom which owns andor operates 12 music venues along with payment of an additional working capital adjustment related to our acquisition of gamerco sa in december 2006 our global artists segment acquired the remaining 49 interest in trunk a specialty merchandise company located in the united states that acquires licenses primarily from music artists to design manufacture and sell merchandise through various distribution channels the remaining 49 interest in musictoday which provides services to artists for online fan clubs artist ecommerce and fulfillment vip packaging and artist fan club ticketing the remaining interests in the cpi entities which engage in full service global tours vip ticketing artist fan clubs merchandising and dvds anthill a merchandising company located in new york and signatures a merchandising company located in san francisco

index to financial statements capital expenditures 

venue operations is a capital intensive business requiring consistent investment in our existing venues in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal state andor local regulations 

we categorize capital outlays into maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and to a lesser extent capital expenditures related to information systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures relate to either the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings or buildings that are being added to our venue network capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation 

our capital expenditures consisted of the following 

 

 revenue generating capital expenditures for 2007 increased significantly from the prior year due to the development and renovation of various venues including the point in ireland the house of blues club in dallas and the acquisition of an additional portion of the land on which we annually stage our reading festival in the united kingdom in addition we invested additional capital in transforming our venues into wired studios to expand on the distribution opportunities of the live concert experience 

revenue generating capital expenditures declined during 2006 primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures associated with the development and renovation of five venues three of which were completed in 2005 in addition in may 2006 we sold one of these venue projects which would have required us to incur capital expenditures to buildout this venue this sale relieved us of these future capital expenditure commitments and reimbursed us for capital expenditures already incurred on this venue although management has determined not to pursue the development of this remaining venue project we expect our revenue generating capital expenditures in 2007 to increase related to the renovation or construction of other venues 

share repurchase program 

our board of directors authorized a 150 million share repurchase program in december 2005 that program expired on december 31 2006 and no new program was approved for 2007 a total of 34 million shares were repurchased under this share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of 427 million including commissions and fees with an average purchase price of 1265 per share 

summary 

our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements and capital expenditures while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily acquisition related our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

  

index to financial statements contractual obligations and commitments 

firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and the venues used in our entertainment operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and theatrical production payments as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into construction related commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our longterm debt outstanding future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditures commitments as of december 31 2007 are as follows 

 

  

    during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 309 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the 

  

index to financial statements table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2008 through 2012 are 16 million each year we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2007 

minimum rentals of 1125 million to be received in years 2008 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

cash flows 

 

 operating activities 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

cash provided by operations was 498 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 176 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 322 million increase in cash provided by operations primarily resulted from changes in the eventrelated operating accounts which are dependent on the number and size of events for upcoming periods accounts receivable decreased rather than increased due to the timing and number of events during 2007 as compared to 2006 and the timing of cash collections resulting in an increase to cash provided by operations in addition we received more deferred revenue and paid less accrued event related expenses during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting in an increase to cash provided by operations conversely the other assets increase was higher primarily due to advances under longterm artist rights agreements resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operating activities finally we paid more prepaid event related expenses during 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operating activities these changes in eventrelated operating accounts are impacted by the timing size and number of events related to music activity in the period 

year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

cash provided by operations was 176 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to cash used in operations of 39 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the 215 million increase in cash provided by operations primarily resulted from an increase in net income adjusted for noncash charges and nonoperating activities and changes in the event related operating accounts which are dependent on the number and size of events ongoing at period end we paid less prepaid event related expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in an increase to cash provided by operations conversely we paid more accrued event related expenses and received less deferred revenue in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operations in addition the accounts receivable increase was higher due to the timing and number of events in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operations finally the other assets increase was higher due primarily to prepaid rent for new lease agreements in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operations 

investing activities 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

cash used in investing activities was 1411 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 3761 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 2350 million decrease in cash used in investing 

  

index to financial statements activities was primarily due to our acquisition of hob during 2006 in addition we received higher proceeds from the divestiture of the oriental theater in chicago and our 50 interest in bic the apollo hammersmith and forum midsized venues in london donington park in leicestershire england seven smallsized music venues in london an office building in san francisco the starwood amphitheater in nashville our remaining 501 interest in the production of phantom the las vegas spectacular and a smallsized music venue in cleveland ohio these decreases were partially offset by increases in our capital expenditures during 2007 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the development of the house of blues club in dallas the renovation of the point in ireland the acquisition of an additional portion of the land on which we annually stage our reading festival in the united kingdom and the wiring of our venues into live studios also offsetting the decreases was an increase in cash used for investing activities primarily related to intangible assets acquired for longterm artist rights agreements 

year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

cash used in investing activities was 3761 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 1060 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the 2701 million increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to 3519 million of cash used primarily for our acquisitions of hob and gamerco sa during 2006 this increase is offset by 363 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain theatrical assets and portions of our sports representation business assets in addition our capital expenditures declined during 2006 as compared to the prior year due to the timing of five venue development and renovation projects three of which were completed in 2005 finally we received more distributions from our nonconsolidated affiliates in 2006 as compared to 2005 

financing activities 

prior to the separation from clear channel we had funded our cash needs through an intercompany promissory note with clear channel the intercompany promissory note functioned as part of a sweep account that allowed excess operating cash generated by our domestic operations to be transferred to clear channel generally on a daily basis as we had cash needs they were funded from clear channel through this account 

since our separation from clear channel we have funded our cash needs through cash from operations borrowings under longterm debt and our revolving credit facility and available cash and cash equivalents 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

cash provided by financing activities was 1102 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2683 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the 1581 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of net payments made on our term loans and revolving credit facility partially offset by increased proceeds received from the issuance of our 2875 convertible notes during 2007 as compared to the proceeds received from the additional term loan during 2006 which was partially used to fund our acquisition of hob last year 

year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

cash provided by financing activities was 2683 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 3633 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the 950 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of repayments on our senior secured credit facility during 2006 repurchases of our common stock during 2006 proceeds received from the issuance of redeemable preferred stock during 2005 and a slight decline in proceeds received from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in contributions from minority interest partners primarily related to a contribution received in advance of certain capital expenditures during 2006 compared to a contribution received from the minority interest partner for the mean fiddler acquisition during 2005 

  

index to financial statements seasonality 

our north american music and international music segments typically experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and international festivals are primarily used or occur during may through september our global theater segment typically experiences its higher operating income during the first second and fourth quarters of the calendar year as the theatrical touring season typically runs from september through april in addition the timing of tours of topgrossing acts in our global artists segment can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted 

cash flows from our north american music international music and global theater segments typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we begin to receive payments from ticket sales still in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a risk factors—our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter so our financial performance in certain financial quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 924 million for the year ended december 31 2007 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2007 by 92 million as of december 31 2007 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound swedish kroner and canadian dollar 

this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

occasionally we will use forward currency contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with artist fee commitments at december 31 2007 we had no outstanding foreign currency contracts 

interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 8226 million total debt outstanding as of december 31 2007 of the total amount we have interest rate hedges with an aggregate notional amount of 1625 million an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of 285 million 2731 million of fixed rate debt and 3585 million of floatingrate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2007 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by 

  

index to financial statements approximately 09 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2007 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

we currently use interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates we do not intend to hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments we must designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions we formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge we discontinue hedge accounting we account for our derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings during the period of change 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge ie hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the same line item associated with the hedged item in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values for example in interest expense when the hedged item is fixedrate debt for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings for example in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with floatingrate debt the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item if any is recognized in other expense income—net in current earnings during the period of change for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign currency the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income loss as part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the extent it is effective any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are recognized in other expense income—net in current earnings during the period of change 

in march 2006 we entered into two separate interest rate swaps for which we purchased a series of interest rate caps and sold a series of interest rate floors with a 1625 million aggregate notional amount that effectively converts a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis these agreements expire in march 2009 the fair value of these agreements at december 31 2007 was a liability of 18 million these agreements were put in place to eliminate or reduce the variability of a portion of the cash flows from the interest payments related to the senior secured credit facility the terms of the senior secured credit facility required that an interest rate swap be put in place for at least 50 of the original 325 million senior term loan and for at least three years 

as part of the acquisition of amg we have interest rate swap agreements with a 285 million aggregate notional amount that effectively converts a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis these agreements expire in january 2015 these interest rate swap agreements have not been designated as hedging instruments therefore any change in fair value is recorded in earnings during the period of the change 

in july 2007 we issued 2200 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 beginning with the period commencing on july 20 2014 and ending on january 14 2015 and for each of the interest periods commencing thereafter we will pay contingent interest on the notes if the average trading price of the notes during the five 

  

index to financial statements consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest period equals or exceeds 120 of the principal amount of the notes the contingent interest payable per note will equal 025 per year of the average trading price of such note during the applicable five tradingday reference period payable in arrears 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements  or statement 157 statement 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings statement 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value statement 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances statement 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that year including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year the provisions of statement 157 are applied prospectively with retrospective application to certain financial instruments we adopted statement 157 on january 1 2008 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or statement 159 statement 159 allows entities to voluntarily choose at specified election dates to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities as well as certain nonfinancial instruments that are similar to financial instruments at fair value or the fair value option the election is made on an instrumentbyinstrument basis and is irrevocable if the fair value option is elected for an instrument statement 159 specifies that all subsequent changes in fair value for that instrument will be reported in earnings statement 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 upon initial adoption statement 159 provides entities with a onetime chance to elect the fair value option for existing eligible items the effect of the first measurement to fair value should be reported as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption we adopted statement 159 on january 1 2008 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1572 effective date of fasb statement no 157 which delays the effective date for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually the effective date for these items was delayed to years beginning after november 15 2008 

in august 2007 the fasb issued for comment an exposure draft of a proposed fasb staff position apb 14a or proposed fsp that would change the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments including our 2875 convertible senior notes under the proposed new rules for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s economic interest cost the effect of the proposed new rules for our 2875 convertible senior notes is that the equity component would be included in the additional paidin capital section of shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2875 convertible senior notes higher interest expense would result by recognizing the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the 2875 convertible senior notes to their face amount as interest expense over the expected term of the 2875 convertible senior notes using an effective interest rate method of amortization this proposed fsp if issued in its current state would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2007 would not permit early application and would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented we are 

  

index to financial statements currently evaluating the proposed new rules and its impact on our current accounting for the 2875 convertible senior notes however if the proposed fsp is adopted in its current form we expect to recognize additional interest expense in future periods due to the interest expense accretion associated with the 2875 convertible senior notes and to report greater than previously reported interest expense due to retrospective application 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141r business combinations  or statement 141r statement 141r establishes revised principles and requirements for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities in a business combination statement 141r requires i recognition of 100 of the fair values of acquired assets including goodwill and assumed liabilities upon obtaining control ii contingent consideration to be fair valued at acquisition date iii transaction costs to be expensed as incurred iv preacquisition contingencies to be accounted for at acquisition date at fair value and v costs of a plan to exit an activity or terminate or relocate employees to be accounted for as post combination costs statement 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we will adopt statement 141r on january 1 2009 and apply the requirements of statement 141r for business combinations that occur after the date of adoption 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51  or statement 160 statement 160 clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests statement 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the provisions of statement 160 are applied prospectively with the exception of reclassifying noncontrolling interests to equity and recasting consolidated net income loss to include net income loss attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests which are required to be adopted retrospectively we will adopt statement 160 on january 1 2009 and are currently assessing the impact its adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 

stock option accounting 

we adopted statement 123r which is a revision of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  or statement 123 effective january 1 2006 statement 123r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb 25 and amends fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 95 statement of cash flows  generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values in accordance with statement 123r we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative we chose the modifiedprospective application of statement 123r and recorded 21 million of noncash compensation expense during the year ended december 31 2006 the total amount of compensation costs not yet recognized related to nonvested stock options at december 31 2007 was 171 million with a weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized of five years 

prior to our adoption of statement 123r we accounted for our stockbased award plans in accordance with apb 25 and related interpretations under which compensation expense was recorded only to the extent that the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price in addition we disclosed the pro forma net income loss as if the stockbased awards had been accounted for using the provisions of statement 123 pro forma earnings loss per share amounts are not disclosed as we had no common stock prior to the separation there have been no modifications made to or changes in the terms related to any outstanding stock options prior to our adoption of statement 123r 

  

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable longlived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill for any potential impairment at least annually using the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 

the income approach we use for valuing goodwill involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets discounted to their present value using a riskadjusted discount rate terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value 

  

index to financial statements if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the presentation and production of an event is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the performance occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction to revenue 

litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

stockbased compensation 

we adopted fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or statement 123r which is a revision of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation  or statement 123 effective january 1 2006 generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values in accordance with statement 123r we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant judgment is required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates noncash compensation expense could be materially impacted 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

we adopted the provisions of fin 48 on january 1 2007 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected 

  

index to financial statements to be taken in a tax return for those benefits to be recognized a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

 the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total company basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues prior period calculations have been revised to conform to the current period presentation

our strategy 

our strategy is to streamline our business assets to focus on live music we believe that this focus will enable us to increase shareholder value by developing new ancillary revenue streams around the live music event we have begun and will continue to execute on this strategy through pursuing the objectives listed below 

 

 

in order to achieve our objectives and successfully implement our strategies we have made and expect to continue to pursue investments acquisitions and divestitures that contribute to the above goals where the valuations returns and growth potential are consistent with our longterm goal of increasing shareholder value we believe that significant opportunities exist both in north american and international markets to expand our distribution network however our ability to make acquisitions and divestitures in 

the near term may be constrained by the limitations imposed by our senior secured credit facility market conditions and our tax matters agreement with clear channel communications see below our relationship with clear channel — tax matters agreement 

our assets 

we believe we have a portfolio of assets that is unmatched in the live music industry 

 

our history

live events industry 

  live music industry 

the live music industry includes concert promotion andor production according to pollstar  north american gross concert revenues increased from 28 billion in 2004 to 36 billion in 2006 a compound annual growth rate of approximately 13 in the 2004 to 2006 period our global live music revenues comprised of gross concert revenues increased from 19 billion to 27 billion a compound annual growth rate of 19 we believe this growth was primarily due to increasing ticket prices for topgrossing acts and the continued desire of these acts such as madonna the rolling stones and u2 to continue touring 

typically to initiate live entertainment events or tours booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with performers to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services promoters earn revenues primarily from the sale of tickets performers are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees andor a percentage of ticket sales or event profits in addition promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and including the right to offset lower ticket revenue shows with higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

for musical tours one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances promoters in conjunction with performers managers and booking agents set ticket prices and advertise events to cover expenses promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues if not provided by booking agents and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

  theatrical industry 

the theatrical industry includes groups engaged in promoting which is generally referred to in the theatrical industry as “presenting” and producing live theatrical presentations according to data from members of the league of american theatres and producers inc gross ticket sales for the north american theatrical industry of touring broadway theatrical performances has increased from 714 million during the 200304 season to 915 million during the 200506 season a compounded annual growth rate of 13 in the 2004 to 2006 period our global theatrical revenues increased from 2300 million to 2775 million a compounded annual growth rate of 10 

live theater consists mainly of productions of existing musicals and dramatic works and the development of new works while musicals require greater investments of time and capital than dramatic productions they are more likely to become touring theatrical shows producers of touring theatrical shows first acquire the rights to works from their owners who typically receive royalty payments in return producers then assemble casts hire directors and arrange for the design and construction of sets and costumes producers also arrange transportation and schedule shows with local presenters local presenters who generally operate or have relationships with venues provide all local services such as selling tickets hiring local personnel buying advertising and paying fixed guarantees to producers presenters then have the right to recover the guarantees plus their local costs from ticket revenues presenters and producers typically share any remaining ticket revenues in order to secure exclusive touring rights investors may take equity positions in broadway new york or west end london shows touring rights are generally granted to investors for three to four years

specialized motor sports events make up a growing segment of the live entertainment industry this growth has resulted from additional demand in existing markets and new demand in markets including europe where arenas and stadiums have been built the increasing popularity of specialized motor sports over the last several years has coincided with the increased popularity of other professional motor sports events such as professional auto racing including the national association for stock car auto racing or nascar and the indy racing league or irl a number of events are also broadcast domestically and internationally

generally related to the volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs such as artist and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenues as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income in the case of our amphitheaters our events segment typically experiences losses related to the promotion of the event these losses are generally offset by the ancillary and sponsorship profits generated by our venues and sponsorship segment and the ticket rebates recorded in our digital distribution segment 

as a producer we generally develop event content hire directors and artistic talent develop sets and costumes and coordinate the actual performances of the events we produce tours on a global national and regional basis we generate revenues from fixed production fees and by sharing in a percentage of event or tour profits primarily related to the sale of tickets merchandise and event and tour sponsorships these production revenues are generally related to the size and profitability of the production production costs included in direct operating expenses are typically substantial in relation to the revenues as a result significant increases or decreases in production revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

we presell tickets for our touring and other theatrical performances through one of the largest subscription series broadway across america  in the united states and canada with 265000 subscribers in the 20062007 season we present these subscription series in approximately 44 touring markets in north america 

we invest in the production of touring and other theatrical performances touring theatrical performances consist primarily of revivals of previous commercial successes or new productions of theatrical performances currently playing on broadway in new york city or the west end in london frequently we invest in shows or productions to obtain touring rights and favorable scheduling to distribute them across our presentation network in 2006 productions in which we had investments included the producers guys and dolls the sound of music and spamalot

  venues and sponsorship 

within our venues and sponsorship segment we are engaged in the management and operation of our owned andor operated venues and the sale of various types of sponsorships and advertising 

we actively pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships and placement of advertising including signage promotional programs and naming of subscription series many of our venues also have venue naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for advertisers our national sponsorship programs have included companies such as american express anheuser busch and verizon our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories revenues generated from sponsorships and advertising typically have a higher margin than promotion or production revenues and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

as a venue operator we contract with promoters to rent our venues for events and provide related services such as concessions merchandising parking security ushering and tickettaking we generate revenues primarily from rental income premium seating and venue sponsorships as well as sharing in percentages of concessions merchandise and parking revenues generated from venue management typically have a higher margin than promotion or production revenues and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income

within our digital distribution segment we are engaged in managing our thirdparty ticketing relationships inhouse ticketing operations and online and wireless distribution activities including the development of our website this segment derives the majority of its revenues from ticket rebates earned on tickets sold through phone outlet and internet for events promoted andor presented by our events segment the sale of the majority of these tickets is outsourced with our share of ticket rebates recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it 

  other 

our sports representation business specializes in the negotiation of professional sports contracts and endorsement contracts for clients our clients have endorsed numerous products both domestically and internationally for many highprofile companies the amount of endorsement and other revenues that our clients generate is a function of among other things the clients’ professional performances and public appeal

as of december 31 2006 we had sold the majority of our sports representation business assets 

competition 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality entertainment products and enhanced fan experiences from music concerts touring theatrical performances and specialized motor sports events including 

 

although we believe that our entertainment products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition financial marketing service support technical and other resources 

  events in the markets in which we promote musical concerts we face competition from promoters as well as from certain artists that promote their own concerts we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

our main competitors in the north american live music industry include anschutz entertainment group jam productions and palace sports  entertainment in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe anschutz entertainment group operates under a number of different names including aeg live concerts west and the messina group some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets and have access to other sports and entertainment assets as well as greater financial resources and brand recognition which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

in the markets in which we present theatrical performances we compete with other presenters to obtain presentation arrangements with venues and performing arts organizations including markets with more than one venue suitable for presenting a touring or other theatrical show we compete with other new york and londonbased production companies for the rights to produce particular shows as a producer of broadway and west end shows we compete with producers of other theatrical performances for box office sales talent and theater space as the producer of a touring show we compete with producers of other touring or other theatrical performances to book the production in desirable presentation markets 

our main competitors in the global theatrical industry include nederlander producing company of america mirvish productions the shubert organization the walt disney company and jujamcyn theaters in north america in europe our competitors include cameron mackintosh really useful theater group and ambassadors theatre group as well as smaller regional players some of our competitors in the theatrical industry have more broadway show interests than we do in new york city from which most north american theatrical touring productions originate in addition these competitors may have significantly greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources which could enable them to strengthen their competitive positions against us 

our main competitors in the specialized motor sports industry are primarily smaller regional promoters on a broader level we compete against other outdoor motor sports such as nascar and irl in the united states some of our competitors in the specialized motor sports industry such as nascar enjoy stronger brand recognition and larger revenues in the motor sports industry than we do and may have greater financial and other resources enabling them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

  venues and sponsorship in markets where we own andor operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region in markets where we do not own or operate venues we compete with other venues and promoters for popular tours consequently touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours our main competitors in the venue management industry include smg and anschutz entertainment group in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in north america and europe some of our competitors in the venue management industry have a greater number of venues in certain markets as well as greater financial resources and brand recognition in those markets 

our main competitors at the local market level for sponsorship consists of local sports teams with their new state of the art venues and strong local media packages additionally our competitors locally can include festivals theme parks and other local events on the national level our competitors include the major sports leagues that all sell sponsorships combined with significant national media packages 

  digital distribution in the online environment we compete with other website companies to provide event information sell tickets and provide other online services such as fan clubs and artist websites our main competitors for online event sites include ticketmaster ticketscom and other secondary ticketing companies 

our relationship with clear channel 

in connection with our separation from clear channel we entered into certain agreements with clear channel the key terms of the principal agreements that continue to be operative are discussed in note j to the consolidated and combined financial statements under item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and are summarized below 

  transition services agreement in december 2005 we entered into a transition services agreement with an affiliate of clear channel pursuant to which that affiliate has provided services to us including but not limited to treasury human resources legal and information systems the charges for the transition services are intended to allow clear channel to fully recover the allocated direct costs of providing the services plus all outofpocket costs and expenses generally without profit the allocation of costs is based on various measures depending on the service provided including relative revenue employee headcount or number of users of a service as of december 31 2006 the only significant services that clear channel continues to provide are information systems related services 

  tax matters agreement in december 2005 we entered into a tax matters agreement with clear channel to govern the respective rights responsibilities and obligations of clear channel and us with respect to tax liabilities and benefits tax attributes tax contests and other matters regarding income taxes nonincome taxes and preparing and filing tax returns as well as with respect to any additional taxes incurred by us attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business following the spinoff including taxes imposed if the spinoff fails to qualify for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” or if clear channel is not able to recognize certain losses 

government regulations 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

we believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food including in some cases requirements relating to the temperature of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our larger operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

we are also required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the united kingdom’s disability discrimination act 1995 or the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to patrons and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

from time to time state and federal governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live entertainment events for entertainment taxes and for other incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

employees 

at december 31 2006 we had approximately 4400 fulltime employees including 3200 domestic and 1200 international employees of which approximately 4300 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 100 were employed in our corporate area 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also from time to time employ parttime or seasonal employees at december 31 2006 we employed approximately 5400 seasonal parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we have employed as many as 15300 seasonal parttime employees the stagehands at some of our venues and the actors musicians and others involved in some of our business operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in 

the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our produced andor presented events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses

 item 1a risk factors 

  you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our leverage our business our common stock and our separation from clear channel the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

risks associated with our leverage 

we have a large amount of debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

our total indebtedness for borrowed money including our redeemable preferred stock was approximately 6791 million at december 31 2006 our available borrowing capacity as of december 31 2006 under our senior secured credit facility is approximately 8350 million consisting of our 5500 million term loan facility 5468 million of which is outstanding and our 2850 million revolving credit facility 480 million of which is outstanding with sublimits up to 2350 million available for letters of credit at december 31 2006 outstanding letters of credit were approximately 440 million leaving total available credit of 1930 million for future borrowings we may also incur additional substantial indebtedness in the future 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

in addition our 40 million of redeemable preferred stock bears an annual dividend rate of 13 or 52 million annually and is subject to financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants applicable to our senior secured credit facility if we default under any of these covenants we will have to pay additional dividends 

as of december 31 2006 we also had approximately 11 billion in operating lease agreement obligations of which approximately 717 million is due in 2007 and 689 million is due in 2008 

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt redeemable preferred stock or lease obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt however these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt redeemable preferred stock or lease service obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all as a result the inability to meet our debt redeemable preferred stock or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations if we fail to meet any minimum financial requirements contained in instruments governing our debt we would be in default under such instruments which in turn could result in defaults under other debt instruments in addition if we default under any of the covenants applicable to our preferred stock we will have to pay additional dividends any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our obligations 

to service our debt lease and preferred stock obligations and to fund potential capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash to meet our needs which depends on many factors beyond our control 

our ability to service our debt lease and preferred stock obligations and to fund potential capital expenditures for venue construction expansion or renovation will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt including our senior secured credit facility will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs as of december 31 2006 approximately 317 million of our total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2007 138 million is due in the aggregate for 2008 and 2009 541 million is due in the aggregate for 2010 and 2011 and 5795 million is due thereafter see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — contractual obligations and commitments — firm commitments if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity we may be limited on assets we can sell under the terms of the tax matters agreement with clear channel we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms if at all our ability to issue additional equity may be constrained because the issuance of additional stock may cause the distribution to be taxable under section 355e of the internal revenue code and under our tax matters agreement with clear channel we would be required to indemnify clear channel against the tax if any in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility other future debt and our preferred stock may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources 

our senior secured credit facility and preferred stock designations may restrict our ability to finance operations and capital needs and our operating flexibility 

our senior secured credit facility and preferred stock designations include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

in addition our senior secured credit facility and preferred stock designations include additional restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of those documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable if we default under any of the covenants applicable to our preferred stock the holder of our preferred stock may be entitled to elect a director of one of our subsidiaries and we will have to pay additional dividends 

any inability to fund the significant upfront cash requirements associated with our touring business could result in the loss of key tours 

in order to secure a tour including global tours by major artists we are often required to post a letter of credit or advance cash to the artist prior to the sale of any tickets for that tour if we do not have sufficient cash on hand or capacity under our revolving credit facility to advance the necessary cash or post the required letter of credit for any given tour we would not be able to promote that tour and our touring business would be negatively impacted 

risk factors relating to our business 

our live entertainment business is highly sensitive to public tastes and dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live entertainment events and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

our ability to generate revenues from our entertainment operations is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform live entertainment content any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists touring theatrical performances specialized motor sports talent and other performers could limit our ability to generate revenues in addition we typically book our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agree to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any operating income therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or a performer cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenues earned as well as foregone revenue we could have earned at booked venues we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover our losses if an performer cancels a tour furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our operating results and profitability 

we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

our operating results have been adversely affected by among other things increased cost of entertainers and a decline in the number of live entertainment events we incurred net losses of approximately 314 million and 1306 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively while we generated net income of approximately 163 million for the year ended december 31 2004 we may face reduced demand for our live entertainment events and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter and year over year so our financial performance in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters or years 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on among other things the timing of tours and theatrical productions tour cancellations capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years typically we experience our lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used and our festivals occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year and potentially annual results 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters in thousands 

 

we may be adversely affected by a general deterioration in economic conditions which could affect consumer and corporate spending and therefore significantly adversely impact our operating results 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment events may have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating income in addition during the most recent economic slowdown in the united states many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenues the risks associated with our businesses become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment events 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seats sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and souvenir sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over additional terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

loss of our key management and other personnel could impact our business 

our business is dependent upon our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business the loss of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations due to their associations and contacts with performers and other key industry agents venue managers and sponsors although we have entered into longterm agreements with some of our key executive officers and other personnel to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts 

doing business in foreign countries creates certain risks not found in doing business in the united states 

doing business in foreign countries involves certain risks that may not exist when doing business in the united states for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 our international operations accounted for approximately 28 and 31 respectively of our revenues during those periods the risks involved in foreign operations that could result in losses against which we are not insured include 

 

in addition we may incur substantial tax liabilities if we repatriate any of the cash generated by our international operations back to the united states due to our current inability to recognize any foreign tax credits that would be associated with such repatriation we are not currently in a position to recognize any tax assets in the united states that are the result of payments of income or withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenues from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 our international operations accounted for approximately 28 and 31 respectively of our revenues during those periods although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound and the euro for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2004 we experienced foreign exchange rate net gains of 32 million and 63 million respectively for those periods which had a positive effect on our operating income while for the year ended december 31 2005 we experienced a foreign exchange rate net loss of 13 million which had a negative effect on our operating 

income see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk — foreign currency risk 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses we may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or make acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals 

acquisitions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations financial reporting technologies and personnel of acquired companies managing geographically dispersed operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in foreign countries also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

in addition restrictions contained in the tax matters agreement between us and clear channel and the credit agreement for our senior secured credit facility restrict our ability to make acquisitions 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live entertainment events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live entertainment events causing a decrease in our revenues 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live entertainment events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live entertainment events at any of our venues or venues that we rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events causing a decrease in our revenues we are currently subject to wrongful death claims as well as other litigation while we maintain insurance polices that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from the terrorist and related security incidents on and after september 11 2001 in the united states as well as the more recent terrorist attacks in madrid and london as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs including coverage for acts of terrorism we have a material investment in property and equipment at 

each of our venues which are generally located near highly populated cities and which hold events typically attended by large numbers of fans at december 31 2006 we had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 8762 million 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others have resulted in and may continue to result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenues depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our venues to meet longterm increasing demand to increase entertainment value and to increase revenues we frequently have a number of significant capital projects under way numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our venues including 

 

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our live entertainment venue operations are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

 

while we believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws we cannot predict the extent to which any future laws or regulations will impact our operations the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex although we often contract with a thirdparty vendor for these services at our operated venues in other cases we provide these services ourselves we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty vendors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we or our thirdparty vendors will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or that we will not be held liable for violations by thirdparty vendors furthermore additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance 

we also serve alcoholic beverages at many of our venues during live entertainment events and must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us there can be no assurance that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance we must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the states in which we serve alcoholic beverages 

from time to time state and federal governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live entertainment events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

we face intense competition in the live entertainment industry and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenues which could adversely affect our financial performance 

our business segments are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current live entertainment revenues we compete in the live entertainment industries and within such industries we compete with other venues to book performers and in the markets in which we promote musical concerts we face competition from other promoters as well as from certain performers who promote their own concerts our competitors also compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or entertainment venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenues the numbers of advertising customers event attendance ticket prices or profit margins include 

 

we believe that barriers to entry into the live entertainment promotion business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

the stagehands at some of our venues and the actors musicians and others involved in some of our business operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage at one or more of our owned andor operated venues or at our produced andor presented events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live entertainment venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we require access to venues to generate revenues from live entertainment events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live entertainment venues under various agreements which include leases with third parties or equity or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live entertainment business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we plan to continue to expand our operations through the development of live entertainment venues and the expansion of existing live entertainment venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

additionally the market potential of live entertainment venues sites cannot be precisely determined and our live entertainment venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live entertainment venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live entertainment venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live entertainment venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to the number of our live entertainment venues on terms we consider acceptable 

our revenues depend in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenues or profits 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns for our live entertainment events and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related souvenir merchandise and apparel in the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we spent approximately 57 and 61 respectively of our revenues on marketing including advertising and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenues or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live entertainment events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

we promote many live entertainment events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and souvenirs among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to the next available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as food beverage and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods if we are unable to reschedule events due to poor weather we are forced to refund the tickets for those events 

our revenues may be impacted by our ability to successfully renegotiate or replace certain key operating contracts 

we currently have key operating contracts with certain third parties that from timetotime expire the future expiration of these contracts will require us to either successfully renegotiate and renew the existing contracts or replace them with suitable alternatives there can be no assurance that such efforts to retain or replace key contracts will be successful and we are unable to estimate the impact on future results of operations 

increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly affect our results of operations 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended require compliance with corporate governance and securities disclosure requirements and require an ongoing review of our internal control procedures these requirements could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers in addition director and officer liability insurance for public companies like us has become more difficult and more expensive to obtain and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur higher costs to obtain coverage that is satisfactory to us and our officers or directors we continue to evaluate and monitor regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude or additional costs we may incur as a result 

if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the united states securities laws to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting to comply with this statute we are required to document and test our internal control procedures our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors are required to issue an 

opinion on management’s assessment of those matters the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules during the course of its testing our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remediated in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanesoxley act if our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal control investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and our stock price may suffer our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue resulting in increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live entertainment events which may decrease our revenues or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents of september 11 2001 military actions in iraq and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following september 11 2001 some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our music business and many people did not travel to new york city which caused us to experience lower attendance levels at our theatrical performances playing on broadway in new york city and adversely affected our theatrical business the occurrence of the 2005 terrorist attacks in london england also caused us to experience lower attendance levels at our theatrical performances playing on the west end in london the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business generally specifically the market for live entertainment 

risks relating to our common stock 

  we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

 

in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of the value of your common stock 

in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that shareholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of your shares 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our shareholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for shareholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our shareholders by written consent three of our twelve directors are also directors of clear channel in addition our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if clear channel acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and clear channel we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel clear channel will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as our shareholder by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a third party 

our obligation to indemnify under certain circumstances clear channel and its affiliates pursuant to the tax matters agreement against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the spinoff to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code could deter a change of control of us 

we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors under specified circumstances our other shareholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control and the preferred stock requires one of our subsidiaries to offer to repurchase the preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources — redeemable preferred stock 

risks relating to our separation from clear channel 

the cost of certain corporate functions necessary to operate as an independent company previously provided by clear channel may increase 

prior to the separation our business was operated by clear channel as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company our historical consolidated and combined financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from clear channel those allocations may be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publiclytraded company clear channel performed various corporate functions for us including but not limited to selected human resources related functions tax administration selected legal functions including compliance with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as external reporting treasury administration investor relations internal audit and insurance functions and selected information technology and telecommunications services 

we have now implemented or are in the process of implementing these functions as we continue to implement these functions the costs may be higher than previous years’ allocations or current estimates and our losses may increase 

we have a short operating history as a separate publiclytraded company and our historical combined and consolidated financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

in december 2005 we were spunoff from clear channel and therefore we have minimal operating history as a separate publiclytraded company the historical consolidated and combined financial information included in this form 10k for years prior to 2006 does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily a result of the following factors 

 

the separation could result in significant tax liability to our initial public shareholders 

clear channel received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its shareholders qualifies as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code although a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service generally is binding on the internal revenue service if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect we will not be able to rely on the ruling 

furthermore the internal revenue service will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the ruling is based upon representations by clear channel that these conditions have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling therefore in addition to obtaining the ruling from the internal revenue service clear channel made it a condition to the separation that clear channel obtain an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp that the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on the ruling as to matters covered by the ruling in addition the opinion is based on among other things certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by clear channel and us which if incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and the internal revenue service or the courts may not agree with the opinion 

notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position our initial public shareholders could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general our initial public shareholders could be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 

the separation could result in significant taxrelated liabilities to us 

as discussed above notwithstanding receipt by clear channel of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position clear channel could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general clear channel would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the distribution otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the distribution were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel may be able to rebut that presumption 

although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel is responsible we and clear channel have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note j relatedparty transactions — relationship with clear channel for a more detailed discussion of the tax matters agreement between clear channel and us 

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel 

each member of the clear channel consolidated group which includes clear channel our company and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel has recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel is unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel for the lost tax benefits that clear channel would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — note j relatedparty transactions — relationship with clear channel 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2006 we own operate or lease 94 venues and 49 facilities including office leases throughout north america and 37 venues and 31 facilities internationally we believe our venues and facilities are generally wellmaintained and in good operating condition and have adequate capacity to meet our current business needs we have a fiveyear lease ending june 30 2010 for our corporate headquarters in beverly hills california used primarily by our executive events and venues and sponsorship domestic operations management staff we also have a fiveyear lease ending september 30 2008 for office space in london england used primarily by our events international operations management staff 

our leases are for varying terms ranging from monthly to multiyear these leases can typically be for terms of three to ten years for our office leases and 15 to 25 years for our venue leases and many provide for renewal options there is no significant concentration of venues under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord we believe that an important part of our management activity is to negotiate suitable lease renewals and extensions 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we were a defendant in a lawsuit filed by melinda heerwagen on june 13 2002 in the us district court for the southern district of new york the plaintiff on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain concert ticket purchasers alleged that anticompetitive practices for concert promotion services by us nationwide caused artificially high ticket prices on august 11 2003 the court ruled in our favor denying the plaintiff’s class certification motion the plaintiff appealed this decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit on january 10 2006 the us court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the ruling in our favor by the district court on january 17 2006 the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of her action in the southern district of new york 

we are a defendant in twentytwo putative class actions filed by different named plaintiffs in various us district courts throughout the country the claims made in these actions are substantially similar to the claims made in the heerwagen action described above except that the geographic markets alleged are regional statewide or more local in nature and the members of the putative classes are limited to individuals who purchased tickets to concerts in the relevant geographic markets alleged the plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory punitive and treble damages declaratory and injunctive relief and costs of suit including attorneys’ fees we have filed our answers in some of these actions and we have denied liability on december 5 2005 we filed a motion before the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to transfer these actions and any similar ones commenced in the future to a single federal district court for coordinated pretrial proceedings on april 17 2006 the panel granted our motion and ordered the consolidation and transfer of the actions to the us district court for the central district of california the court has set a hearing on motions for class certification for april 23 2007 and trial is set for december 11 2007 we intend to vigorously defend all claims in all of the actions 

from time to time we are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business including proceedings and claims based upon violations of antitrust laws and tortious interference which could cause us to incur significant expenses we also have been the subject of personal injury and wrongful death claims relating to accidents at our venues in connection with our operations as required we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or other losses for the resolution of any outstanding claims these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings in addition under our agreements with clear channel we have assumed and will indemnify clear channel for liabilities related to our business for which they are a party in the defense

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report this discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties the forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations estimates assumptions and projections about our industry business and future financial results our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of factors including those discussed under item 1a risk factors and other sections in this annual report 

executive overview 

beginning in 2006 we adjusted our reportable segments due to a reorganization of our business and a change in the way in which management views and manages our business our new segments are events venues and sponsorship and digital distribution in addition we have operations in the sports representation and other businesses which are included under “other” 

this has been the first year of our transformation of live nation from a broadbased live entertainment company to a company focused on bringing live events and related products to music fans worldwide this transformation has involved exiting some of our nonmusic businesses and acquiring other businesses involved in live music promotion and production and complementary services 

the highlights for each of our segments for 2006 are 

  events 

 

  venues and sponsorship 

 

 

  digital distribution 

 

  other operations 

 

  recent developments 

 

our separation from clear channel 

we were formed through acquisitions of various entertainment businesses and assets by our predecessors on august 1 2000 clear channel acquired our entertainment business on august 2 2005 we were incorporated in our current form as a delaware corporation to own substantially all of the entertainment business of clear channel on december 21 2005 the separation of the business previously conducted by clear channel’s live entertainment segment and sports representation business now comprising our business and the distribution by clear channel of all of our common stock to its shareholders was completed in a tax free spinoff following 

our separation from clear channel we became a separate publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange trading under the symbol “lyv” 

basis of presentation 

prior to the separation our combined financial statements include amounts that are comprised of businesses included in the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of clear channel using the historical bases of assets and liabilities of the entertainment business management believes the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable however the combined financial statements included herein may not reflect what our results of operations financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented as a result of the separation we recognized the par value and additional paidin capital in connection with the issuance of our common stock in exchange for the net assets of clear channel’s entertainment business contributed at that time and we began accumulating retained earnings and currency translation adjustments upon completion of the separation beginning on december 21 2005 our consolidated financial statements include all accounts of live nation and our majority owned subsidiaries and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 

segment overview 

following the separation and the reorganization of our business we changed our reportable segments starting in 2006 to events venues and sponsorship and digital distribution in addition we have operations in the sports representation and other businesses which are included under “other” previously we operated in two reportable business segments global music and global theater in addition previously included under “other” were our operations in the specialized motor sports sports representation and other businesses we have reclassified all periods presented to conform to the current period presentation 

  events 

our events segment principally involves the promotion andor production of live music shows theatrical performances and specialized motor sports events in our owned andor operated venues and in rented thirdparty venues while our events segment operates yearround we experience higher revenues during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at our outdoor amphitheaters and international festivals which primarily occur may through september 

as a promoter or presenter we typically book performers arrange performances and tours secure venues provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract audiences we earn revenues primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales or show profits for each event we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue revenues are generally related to the number of events volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs included in direct operating expenses such as artist and production service expenses are typically substantial in relation to the revenues as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income in the case of our amphitheaters our events segment typically experiences losses related to the promotion of the event these losses are generally offset by the ancillary and sponsorship profits generated by our venues and sponsorship segment and the ticket rebates recorded in our digital distribution segment 

as a producer we generally hire artistic talent develop sets and coordinate the actual performances of the events we produce tours on a global national and regional basis we generate revenues by sharing in a percentage of event or tour profits primarily related to the sale of tickets merchandise and event and tour sponsorships these production revenues are generally related to the size and profitability of the production artist and production costs included in direct operating expenses are typically substantial in relation to the revenues as a result significant increases or decreases in revenue related to these productions do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

in addition to the above we provide various services to artists including marketing advertising production services merchandise distribution and dvdcd production and distribution 

to judge the health of our events segment management primarily monitors the number of confirmed events in our network of owned and thirdparty venues talent fees average paid attendance and advance ticket sales in addition because a significant portion of our events business is conducted in foreign markets management looks at the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 

  venues and sponsorship 

our venues and sponsorship segment primarily involves the management and operation of our owned andor operated venues and the sale of various types of sponsorships and advertising 

as a venue operator we contract primarily with our events segment to fill our venues and we provide operational services such as concessions merchandising parking security ushering and tickettaking we generate revenues primarily from the sale of food and beverages parking premium seating and venue sponsorships in our amphitheaters the sale of food and beverages is outsourced and we receive a share of the net revenues from the concessionaire which is recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it our primary food and beverage vendor is aramark corporation which provides services to 38 of our venues consisting of substantially all amphitheaters including seven former hob amphitheaters 

we actively pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships and placement of advertising including signage and promotional programs and naming of subscription series many of our venues also have venue naming rights sponsorship programs we believe national sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for advertisers our national sponsorship programs have included companies such as american express anheuser busch and verizon our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories 

to judge the health of our venues and sponsorship segment management primarily reviews the number of events at our owned andor operated venues attendance food and beverage sales per attendee premium seat sales and corporate sponsorship sales in addition because a significant portion of our venues and sponsorship business is conducted in foreign markets management looks at the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 

digital distribution 

our digital distribution segment is creating the new internet and digital platform for live nation this segment is involved in managing our thirdparty ticketing relationships inhouse ticketing operations and online and wireless distribution activities including the development of our website this segment derives the majority of its revenues from ticket rebates earned on tickets sold through phone outlet and internet for events promoted or presented by our events segment the sale of the majority of these tickets is outsourced with our share of ticket rebates recorded in revenue with no significant direct operating expenses associated with it 

the largest component of our ticket rebate revenue is derived from tickets sold at our north american owned andor operated venues a smaller component of our ticket rebate revenue is derived from our international promotion operations where rebates per ticket are generally lower and we sell fewer tickets overall we also derive ticket rebate revenue from tickets sold in thirdparty venues in connection with a live nation event where we either utilize our ticketmaster contract or participate in the ticket rebate revenues generated by the venue’s ticketing deal the economics of these deals vary by venue in some cases where we receive ticket rebate revenue from ticketmaster for events promoted in thirdparty venues a substantial portion of that revenue is passed through to those third parties and that cost is recorded as a component of direct operating expenses in our events segment 

to judge the health of our digital distribution segment management primarily reviews the rebates earned per ticket sold and the number of unique visitors to our websites

  income taxes 

our effective tax rate is 645 for 2006 compared to an effective tax rate of 89 in 2005 our effective tax rate for 2006 would be 134 excluding the impact of valuation allowances recorded against increases in deferred tax assets related to impairments recorded during the year or 71 excluding combined effects of tax reserves and these valuation allowances 

the negative effective tax rate in 2005 was due primarily to a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of 2005 and other nondeductible expenses incurred this effective tax rate represents net tax expense of 372 million and 615 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the net decrease in tax expense is primarily attributable to increases in taxable income and a reduction in deferred tax expense due to a smaller valuation allowance adjustment in 2006 our effective tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate of 35 due primarily to nondeductible expenses state income taxes tax reserves and tax rate differences since a significant portion of our full year earnings are subject to tax in countries other than the united states 

current tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2005 decreased 29 million as compared to the same period of the prior year deferred tax expense increased 601 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the same period of the prior year the increase in deferred tax expense is primarily due to the 773 million valuation reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 and subsequent to our separation from clear channel related to our deferred tax asset as a subsidiary of clear channel taxable losses of our subsidiaries were able to be utilized under a consolidated income tax return with clear channel after the separation our 

deferred tax asset had to be evaluated on a standalone basis based on prior historical taxable income since we have had a history of taxable losses we recorded a valuation allowance against this asset

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is currently managed on a worldwide basis repatriation of some of these funds could be subject to delay and could have potential tax consequences principally with respect to withholding taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions which do not give rise to a tax benefit in the united states due to our current inability to realize foreign tax credits 

our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 3139 million and current and longterm debt of 6391 million at december 31 2006 and cash and cash equivalents of 4037 million and current and longterm debt of 3668 million at december 31 2005 these debt balances do not include our outstanding redeemable preferred stock 

on november 3 2006 we completed our previously announced acquisition of hob for 354 million in cash approximately 360 million including transaction and financing fees and expenses the sources of funds to finance the acquisition included 831 million of cash on hand 73 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the addition of a new 200 million term loan 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all our ability to issue additional equity may be constrained because the issuance of additional stock may cause the distribution to be taxable under section 355e of the internal revenue code and under our tax matters agreement with clear channel we would be required to indemnify clear channel against the tax if any we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents market conditions and the tax matters agreement 

we generally receive cash related to ticket revenues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of event related expenses at or after the event we view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents less eventrelated deferred revenue less accrued expenses due to artists and for cash collected on behalf of others plus eventrelated prepaids this is essentially our cash available to among other things repay debt balances make acquisitions repurchase stock and finance capital expenditures 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our events segment which reports the majority of its revenues in the second and third quarters while our venues and sponsorship segment reports the majority of its revenues in the second third and fourth quarters of the year cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event see “— seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility along with potential additional financing alternatives to satisfy working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

sources of cash 

  senior secured credit facility 

we have a senior secured credit facility consisting of a term loan in the original amount of 325 million and a 285 million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility with sublimits of up to 235 million to be available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to 100 million to be available for borrowings in foreign currencies the term loan and revolving credit portions of the credit facility mature in june 2013 and june 2012 respectively we are required to make minimum quarterly principal repayments under the original term loan of approximately 32 million per year through march 2013 with the remaining balance due at maturity we are required to prepay the outstanding term loan subject to certain exceptions and conditions from certain asset sale proceeds and casualty and condemnation proceeds that we do not reinvest within a 365day period or from certain additional debt issuance proceeds 

in connection with the hob acquisition in november 2006 we entered into an incremental assumption agreement and amendment no 1 to our senior secured credit facility this amendment increases the amount available under the senior secured credit facility by providing for a new 200 million term loan which matures in december 2013 we are required to make minimum quarterly principal repayments under this additional term loan of approximately 20 million per year through september 2013 with the remaining balance due at maturity 

in december 2006 we entered into amendment no 2 to our senior secured credit facility this amendment provides that all term loans under the credit facility bear interest at per annum floating rates equal at our option to either a the base rate which is the greater of the prime rate offered by jpmorgan chase bank na or the federal funds rate plus 5 plus 175 or b adjusted libor plus 275 

in december 2006 we entered into an incremental assumption agreement and amendment no 3 to our senior secured credit facility this amendment increases the amount available under the senior secured credit facility by providing for an additional 25 million term loan which matures in december 2013 we are required to make minimum quarterly principal repayments under this additional term loan of approximately 03 million per year through september 2013 with the remaining balance due at maturity 

during the year ended december 31 2006 we made principal payments totaling 33 million and 690 million on the term loans and revolving credit facility respectively the payments on the revolving credit facility were due to shortterm borrowings to fund working capital requirements during the year at december 31 2006 the outstanding balances on the term loans and revolving credit facility were 5468 million and 480 respectively taking into account letters of credit of 440 million 1930 million was available for future borrowings 

as of february 23 2007 the outstanding balances on the term loans and revolving credit facility were 5468 million and 580 million respectively taking into account letters of credit of 504 million 1766 million was available for future borrowings 

borrowings under the term loan portion of the credit facility bear interest at per annum floating rates equal at our option to either a the base rate which is the greater of the prime rate offered by jpmorgan chase bank na or the federal funds rate plus 5 plus 175 or b adjusted libor plus 275 borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility bear interest at per annum floating rates equal at our option to either a the base rate which is the prime rate offered by jpmorgan chase bank na  plus an applicable margin or b adjusted libor plus an applicable margin sterling and eurodenominated borrowings under the revolving portion of the credit facility currently bear interest at per annum floating rates equal to either adjusted libor or adjusted euribor respectively plus an applicable margin the revolving credit facility margins are subject to change based upon the amount of leverage for the previous calendar quarter at december 31 2006 the applicable margins for base rate adjusted libor and euribor borrowings were 75 175 and 175 respectively under the terms of the original term loan we are required to enter into an interest rate swap for a minimum of 50 of the outstanding debt for a minimum of three years 

the interest rate we pay on borrowings on our senior term loans is 275 above libor the interest rate we pay on our 285 million multicurrency revolving credit facility depends on our total leverage ratio based on our current total leverage ratio our interest rate on revolving credit borrowings is 175 above libor in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the credit facility we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments as of december 31 2006 the commitment fee rate was 25 we also are required to pay customary letter of credit fees as necessary in the event our leverage ratio improves the interest rate on revolving credit borrowings declines gradually to 75 at a total leverage ratio of less than or equal to 125 times 

the senior secured credit facility contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional debt pay dividends and make distributions make certain investments and acquisitions repurchase our stock and prepay certain 

indebtedness create liens enter into agreements with affiliates modify the nature of our business enter into saleleaseback transactions transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate 

  redeemable preferred stock 

as part of the separation one of our subsidiaries sold 200000 shares of series a voting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to thirdparty investors and issued 200000 shares of series b nonvoting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to clear channel which then sold this series b redeemable preferred stock to thirdparty investors we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the series b redeemable preferred stock sold by clear channel as of december 31 2006 we had 200000 shares of series a redeemable preferred stock and 200000 shares of series b redeemable preferred stock outstanding collectively the “preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of 40 million the preferred stock accrues dividends at 13 per annum and is mandatorily redeemable on december 21 2011 although we are obligated to make an offer to repurchase the preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference in the event of a change of control 

the certificate of incorporation governing the redeemable preferred stock contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional debt issue certain equity securities create liens merge or consolidate modify the nature of our business make certain investments and acquisitions transfer and sell material assets enter into saleleaseback transactions enter into swap agreements pay dividends and make distributions and enter into agreements with affiliates if we default under any of these covenants we will have to pay additional dividends 

at december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all redeemable preferred stock covenants we expect to remain in compliance with all of our preferred stock covenants throughout 2007 

  guarantees of thirdparty obligations 

as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 19 million for each of the respective periods primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee and tour related credit cards and in 2006 this included guarantees of bank lines of credit of a nonconsolidated affiliate and a thirdparty promoter 

as of december 31 2006 in connection with the sale of a portion of our sports representation business assets we guaranteed the performance of a thirdparty related to an employment contract in the amount of approximately 09 million 

  disposal of assets 

during the year ended december 31 2006 we received 363 million of proceeds primarily related to the sale of certain theatrical assets and portions of our sports representation business assets 

  debt covenants 

the significant covenants on our multicurrency senior secured credit facility relate to total leverage senior leverage interest coverage and capital expenditures contained and defined in the credit agreement the leverage ratio covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents up to a maximum of 150 million all as defined by the credit agreement to consolidated earningsbeforeinteresttaxesdepreciationandamortization as defined by the credit agreement “consolidated ebitda” of less than 45x through december 31 2008 and less than 40x thereafter provided that aggregated subordinated indebtedness is less than 25 million the senior leverage covenant which is only applicable provided aggregate subordinated indebtedness is greater than 25 million requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated senior indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of less than 30x the interest coverage covenant requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to cash interest expense as defined by the credit agreement of 25x the capital expenditure covenant limits annual capital expenditures as defined by the credit agreement to 125 million or less through december 31 2006 and 110 million or less thereafter in the event that we do not meet these covenants we are considered to be in default on the credit facilities at which time the credit facilities may become immediately due this credit facility contains a cross default provision that would be triggered if we were to default on any other indebtedness greater than 10 million 

our other indebtedness does not contain provisions that would make it a default if we were to default on our credit facilities 

we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event of default upon a change in longterm debt ratings that would have a material impact on our financial statements 

at december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all debt covenants we expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants throughout 2007 

uses of cash 

  acquisitions 

when we make acquisitions especially of entities where we buy a controlling interest only the acquired entity may have cash on its balance sheet at the time of acquisition all amounts discussed in this section are presented net of any cash acquired during the year ended december 31 2006 our venues and sponsorship segment used 3369 million in cash primarily for our acquisition of hob and an interest in historic theatre group hob owns andor operates ten branded clubs in los angeles anaheim san diego las vegas new orleans chicago cleveland orlando myrtle beach and atlantic city the commodore ballroom a smallsized music venue in vancouver and eight amphitheaters in seattle los angeles san diego denver dallas atlanta cleveland and toronto historic theatre group operates three theaters in the minneapolis area that primarily host theatrical performances in addition our events segment used 190 million in cash primarily for our acquisitions of an interest in angel festivals limited a dance festival promotion company an interest in trunk ltd a specialty merchandise company interests in several concert productions international entities which engage in full service global tours provide certain artist services and invest in theatrical productions and gamerco sa a concert promotion company in spain finally our digital distribution segment received 40 million in cash primarily related to our acquisition of an interest in musictoday which provides services to artists for online fan clubs artist ecommerce and fulfillment vip packaging and artist fan club and secondary market ticketing 

  capital expenditures 

venue operations is a capital intensive business requiring consistent investment in our existing venues in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal and state regulations 

we categorize capital outlays into maintenance capital expenditures and revenue generating capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and to a lesser extent capital expenditures related to information systems web development and administrative offices revenue generating capital expenditures relate to either the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings that are being added to our venue network capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation 

our capital expenditures consisted of the following 

 

maintenance capital expenditures for 2005 include higher expenditures relating to capital spent to improve the audience experience at our owned andor operated amphitheaters we expect maintenance capital expenditures for 2007 to be consistent with 2006 

revenue generating capital expenditures declined during 2006 primarily due to the timing of capital expenditures associated with the development and renovation of five venues three of which were completed in 2005 in addition in may 2006 we sold one of these venue projects which would have required us to incur capital expenditures to buildout this venue this sale relieved us of these future capital expenditure commitments and reimbursed us for capital expenditures already incurred on this venue although management has determined not to pursue the development of this remaining venue project we expect our revenue generating capital expenditures in 2007 to increase related to the renovation or construction of other venues 

  share repurchase program 

our board of directors authorized a 150 million share repurchase program in december 2005 that program expired on december 31 2006 a total of 34 million shares were repurchased under this share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of 427 million including commissions and fees with an average purchase price of 1265 per share from january 1 2006 to december 31 2006 we repurchased 19 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 247 million including commissions and fees 

summary 

our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements and capital expenditures while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily acquisition related our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

contractual obligations and commitments 

  firm commitments 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and the venues used in our entertainment operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and theatrical production payments as part of our ongoing capital projects we will enter into construction related commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

the scheduled maturities of our longterm debt outstanding future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditures commitments as of december 31 2006 are as follows 

 

 

 57 

 during 2006 in connection with our acquisition of the historic theatre group we guaranteed obligations related to a lease agreement in the event of default we could be liable for obligations which have future lease payments undiscounted of approximately 453 million through the end of 2035 which are not reflected in the table above the scheduled future minimum rentals for this lease for the years 2007 through 2011 are 16 million each year we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under this lease is remote and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations as of december 31 2006

minimum rentals of 1165 million to be received in years 2007 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

cash flows 

 

  operating activities 

  year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

cash provided by operations was 167 million for the year ended december 31 2006 compared to cash used in operations of 39 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the 206 million increase in cash provided by operations primarily resulted from an increase in net income adjusted for noncash charges and nonoperating activities and changes in the event related operating accounts which are dependent on the number and size of events ongoing at period end we paid less prepaid event related expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in an increase to cash provided by operations conversely we paid more accrued event related expenses and received less deferred revenue in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operations in addition the accounts receivable increase was higher due to the timing and number of events in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operations finally the other assets increase was higher due primarily to prepaid rent for new lease agreements in 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting in a decrease to cash provided by operations 

  year ended 2005 compared to year ended 2004 

cash used in operations was 39 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to cash provided by operations of 1225 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 1264 million decrease in cash provided by operations resulted from a decrease in net income adjusted for noncash charges related to deferred income tax expense and changes in the event related operating accounts which are dependent on the number and size of events ongoing at year end we had prepaid more expenses in 2005 including artist deposits and accrued more expenses based on the size and timing of the upcoming tours 

  investing activities 

  year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

cash used in investing activities was 3752 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 1060 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the 2692 million increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to 3519 million of cash used primarily for our acquisition of hob and gamerco sa during 2006 this increase is offset by 363 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain theatrical assets and portions of our sports representation business assets in addition our capital expenditures declined during 2006 as compared to the prior year due to the timing of five venue development and renovation projects three of which were completed in 2005 finally we received more distributions from our nonconsolidated affiliates in 2006 as compared to 2005 

  year ended 2005 compared to year ended 2004 

cash used in investing activities was 1060 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to cash used in investing activities of 841 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 219 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of 191 million and an increase in advances to nonconsolidated affiliates of 43 million these increases were partially offset by less acquisition related payments in 2005 

  financing activities 

historically we had funded our cash needs through an intercompany promissory note with clear channel the intercompany promissory note functioned as part of a sweep account that allowed excess operating cash generated by our domestic operations to be transferred to clear channel generally on a daily basis as we had cash needs they were funded from clear channel through this account 

since our separation from clear channel we have funded our cash needs through cash from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash and cash equivalents 

  year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

cash provided by financing activities was 2683 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 3633 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the 950 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of repayments on our senior secured credit facility during 2006 repurchases of our common stock during 2006 proceeds received from the issuance of redeemable preferred stock during 2005 and a slight decline in proceeds received from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in contributions from minority interest partners primarily related to a contribution received in advance of certain capital expenditures during 2006 compared to a contribution received from the minority interest partner for the mean fiddler acquisition during 2005 

  year ended 2005 compared to year ended 2004 

cash provided by financing activities was 3633 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 207 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 3426 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from our term loan the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and a contribution received from the minority interest partner for the mean fiddler acquisition during 2005 offset by repurchases of our common stock 

seasonality 

our events segment typically experiences operating losses in the second and third quarters due to the timing of the live music events especially domestically where artist performance fees and other costs typically exceed ticket revenues these losses are generally offset by higher operating income in the second and third quarters in our venues and sponsorship segment as our outdoor venues are primarily used in and our sponsorship fulfillment is higher during may through september we also experience higher operating income in the second and third quarters in our digital distribution segment based on ticket rebates earned on the activity in our events segment in addition the timing of tours of topgrossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted 

cash flows from our events segment typically have a slightly different seasonality as payments are often made for artist performance fees and production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we begin to receive payments from ticket sales still in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a risk factors — our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter so our financial performance in certain financial quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters 

market risk 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

  foreign currency risk 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries our foreign operations reported operating income of 536 million for the year ended december 31 2006 we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2006 by 54 million as of december 31 2006 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound swedish kroner and canadian dollar 

this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the united states or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities 

occasionally we will use forward currency contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with artist fee commitments at december 31 2006 we had 09 million outstanding in forward currency contracts 

  interest rate risk 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 6391 million total debt outstanding as of december 31 2006 of the total amount we have an interest rate hedge with a notional amount of 1625 million 439 million of fixed rate debt and 4327 million of variable rate debt 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2006 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 11 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2006 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

we currently use interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates we do not intend to hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments we must designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged as a fair value hedge cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions we formally assess both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge we discontinue hedge accounting we account for our derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings during the period of change 

for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge ie hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the same line item associated with the hedged item in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values for example in interest expense when the hedged item is fixedrate debt for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge ie hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings for example in interest expense when the hedged transactions are interest cash flows associated with floatingrate debt the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item if any is recognized in other expense income — net in current earnings during the period of change for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign currency the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income loss as part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the extent it is effective any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are recognized in other expense income — net in current earnings during the period of change 

in march 2006 we entered into two separate interest rate swaps for which we purchased a series of interest rate caps and sold a series of interest rate floors with a 1625 million aggregate notional amount that effectively converts a portion of our floatingrate debt to a fixedrate basis these agreements expire in march 2009 the fair value of these agreements at december 31 2006 was an asset of 01 million these agreements were put in place to eliminate or reduce the variability of a portion of the cash flows from the interest payments related to the senior secured credit facility the terms of our senior secured credit facility required that an interest rate swap be put in place for at least 50 of the 325 million senior term loan and for at least three years 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in february 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position no fas 123r4 contingent cash settlement “fsp fas 123r4” fsp fas 123r4 requires companies to classify employee stock options and similar instruments with contingent cash settlement features as equity awards under fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “statement 123r” provided that i the contingent event that permits or requires cash settlement is not considered probable of occurring and is not within the control of the employee and ii the award includes no other features that would require liability classification we considered fsp fas 123r4 with our implementation of statement 123r and determined it had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in april 2006 the fasb issued fasb staff position fin 46r6 determining the variability to be considered when applying fasb interpretation no 46r “fsp fin 46r6” fsp fin 46r6 addresses the approach to determine the variability to consider when applying fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 consolidation of variable interest entities “fin 46r” the variability that is considered in applying fin 46r may affect i the determination as to whether the entity is a variable interest entity ii the determination of which interests are variable interests in the entity iii if necessary the calculation of expected losses and residual returns of the entity and iv the determination of which party is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity we adopted fsp fin 46r6 on july 1 2006 and its adoption did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” fin 48 creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition measurement classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we adopted fin 48 on january 1 2007 as required the cumulative effect of adopting fin 48 if any will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable while we continue to assess the effects of adoption of fin 48 we expect that our adoption of fin 48 will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations we also expect that application of fin 48 may result in a greater degree of volatility in the effective tax rate and balance sheet classification of tax liabilities 

in june 2006 the emerging issues task force “eitf” ratified the consensus reached in issue 063 — how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation “eitf 063” eitf 063 is applicable to all taxes that are externally imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer eitf 063 concludes that a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net if taxes subject to eitf 063 are significant a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis eitf 063 is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december 15 2006 with early application of this guidance permitted we early adopted eitf 063 on june 30 2006 and have added the required disclosures to reflect our policy on presenting taxes on a net basis 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements “statement 157” statement 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings statement 157 applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value statement 157 does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances statement 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that year including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year the provisions of statement 157 are applied prospectively with retrospective application to certain financial instruments we will adopt statement 157 on january 1 2008 and are currently assessing the impact its adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements “sab 108” sab 108 sab topic 1n addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements specifically how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements sab 108 does not change the sec staff’s previous positions in staff accounting bulletin no 99 materiality sab topic 1m regarding qualitative considerations in assessing the materiality of misstatements sab 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 sab 108 offers special transition provisions only for circumstances where its application would have altered previous materiality conclusions the sec staff encourages early application of the guidance in sab 108 in financial statements filed after the publication of sab 108 for any interim period of the first fiscal year ending after november 15 2006 we adopted sab 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006 and its adoption did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations

we adopted statement 123r which is a revision of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “statement 123” effective january 1 2006 statement 123r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees “apb 25” and amends fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 95 statement of cash flows  generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values in accordance with statement 123r we continue to use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative we chose the modifiedprospective application of statement 123rand recorded 21 million of noncash compensation expense during the year ended december 31 2006 we expect that future periods of 2007 will be impacted by similar amounts until additional stock option grants are approved the total amount of compensation costs not yet recognized related to nonvested stock options at december 31 2006 was 62 million with a weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized of five years 

prior to our adoption of statement 123r we accounted for our stockbased award plans in accordance with apb 25 and related interpretations under which compensation expense was recorded only to the extent that the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price in addition we disclosed the pro forma net income loss as if the stockbased awards had been accounted for using the provisions of statement 123 pro forma earnings loss per share amounts are not disclosed as we had no common stock prior to the separation there have been no modifications made to or changes in the terms related to any outstanding stock options prior to our adoption of statement 123r 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

  allowance for doubtful accounts 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to a lesser extent we recognize reserves based on historical experience of bad debts as a percentage of revenues for applicable businesses adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

  longlived assets 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable longlived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair value 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values and other fair value measures our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

  goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill for any potential impairment at least annually using the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 

the income approach we use for valuing goodwill involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets discounted to their present value using a riskadjusted discount rate terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value based on our analysis for 2006 no impairment was required 

  revenue recognition 

revenue from the presentation and production of an event is recognized after the performance occurs upon settlement of the event revenue related to larger global tours is recognized after the performance occurs however any profits related to these tours primarily related to music tour production and tour management services is recognized after minimum revenue thresholds if any have been achieved revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs revenue collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred revenue and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

we account for taxes that are externally imposed on revenue producing transactions on a net basis as a reduction to revenue 

  barter transactions 

barter transactions represent the exchange of display space or tickets for advertising merchandise or services these transactions are generally recorded at the lower of the fair value of the display space or tickets relinquished or the fair value of the advertising merchandise or services received revenue is recognized on barter transactions when the advertisements are displayed or the event occurs for which the tickets are exchanged expenses are recorded when the advertising merchandise or service is received or when the event occurs 

  litigation accruals 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

  income taxes 

we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

our provision for income taxes has been computed on the basis that we file consolidated income tax returns with our subsidiaries prior to the separation our operations were included in a consolidated federal income tax return filed by clear channel certain tax liabilities owed by us were remitted to the appropriate taxing authority by clear channel and were accounted for as noncash capital contributions by clear channel to us tax benefits recognized on employee stock option exercises were retained by clear channel subsequent to the separation we file separate consolidated income tax returns 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges rental charges exclude variable rent expense for events in thirdparty venues prior period calculations have been revised to conform to the current period presentation

the board of directors and shareholders of live nation inc 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that live nation inc maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria live nation inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

our company 

 

we believe we are one of the world’s largest diversified venue operators for and promoters and producers of live entertainment events for the year ended december 31 2005 we promoted produced or hosted over 29500 events including music concerts theatrical performances specialized motor sports and other events with total attendance nearing 60 million in addition we believe we operate one of the largest networks of venues used principally for music concerts and theatrical performances in the united states and europe as of december 31 2005 we owned or operated 119 venues consisting of 77 domestic and 42 international venues these venues include 37 amphitheaters 61 theaters 15 clubs four arenas and two festival sites in addition through equity booking or similar arrangements we have the right to book events at 34 additional venues for the year ended december 31 2005 we generated revenues of approximately 29 billion approximately 90 of our total revenues for 2005 resulted from revenues related to our owned or operated venues and from our promotion or production of music concerts and theatrical performances 

 

in addition we believe we are a leading integrated sports marketing and management company specializing in the representation of sports athletes 

 

our principal executive offices are located at 9348 civic center drive beverly hills california 90210 telephone 3108677000 

our history 

 

we were formed through acquisitions of various entertainment businesses and assets by our predecessors on august 1 2000 clear channel communications inc “clear channel” or “clear channel communications” acquired our live entertainment business which was initially formed in 1997 on august 2 2005 we were incorporated in our current form as a delaware corporation to own substantially all of the entertainment business of clear channel communications on december 21 2005 the separation of the business previously conducted by clear channel’s live entertainment segment and sports representation business now comprising our business and the distribution by clear channel of all of our common stock to its shareholders was completed in a tax free spin off the “distribution” the “separation” or the “spinoff” following our separation from clear channel we became a separate publicly traded company on the new york stock exchange nyse lyv on december 21 2005 in connection with the separation we issued through one of our subsidiaries 400 million of redeemable preferred stock and borrowed 3250 million under a new credit agreement we used the proceeds to repay 2200 million of debt owed to clear channel communications and clear channel communications contributed to our capital the remaining balance owed them see “— recent developments” 

 

live music industry 

 

the live music industry includes concert promotion and production set design venue and concession operation our main competitors in the north american live music industry include anschutz entertainment group which operates under a number of different names house of blues entertainment inc and smg entertainment inc we also compete with numerous smaller national and regional companies in the united states and europe 

 

according to pollstar a leading publisher of concert industry data from 2003 to 2005 north american gross concert revenues increased from 25 billion to 31 billion a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11 in the 2003 to 2005 period our global music revenues comprised of gross concert revenues increased from 21 billion to 23 billion a compounded annual growth rate of 6 we believe this growth was primarily due to increasing ticket prices for topgrossing acts and the continued willingness of these acts such as madonna the rolling stones and u2 to continue touring according to pollstar while industry revenues increased from 2004 to 2005 ticket sales for the top 100 tours representing approximately 67 of total domestic concert ticket revenues declined by 35 although total attendance at our owned and operated amphitheaters declined in 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of fewer events the average per show attendance at these venues actually increased 7 we believe that this increase in average attendance was driven by a decrease in the average ticket price by 6 during 2005 

 

typically to initiate live entertainment events or tours booking agents directly contract with performers to represent them for defined periods booking agents then contact promoters who will contract with them or directly with performers to arrange events booking agents generally receive fixed or percentage fees from performers for their services promoters earn revenues primarily from the sale of tickets as well as percentages of revenues from concessions performers are paid by the promoter under one of several different formulas which may include fixed guarantees percentages of ticket sales or the greater of guaranteed amounts or profit sharing payments based on gross ticket revenues in addition promoters may also reimburse performers for certain costs of production such as sound and lights under guaranteed payment formulas promoters assume the risks of unprofitable events promoters may renegotiate lower guarantees or cancel events because of insufficient ticket sales in order to reduce their losses promoters can also reduce the risk of losses by entering into global or national touring agreements with performers and including the right to offset lower ticket revenue shows with higher performing shows on the tour in the determination of overall artist fees 

 

for musical tours one to four months typically elapse between booking performers and the first performances promoters in conjunction with performers managers and agents set ticket prices and advertise events to cover expenses promoters market events sell tickets rent or otherwise provide venues if not provided by booking agents and arrange for local production services such as stages and sets 

venue operators typically contract with promoters to rent their venues for specific events on specific dates venue operators provide services such as concessions parking security ushering and tickettaking and receive some or all of the revenues from concessions merchandise sponsorships parking and premium seats for the events they host venue operators typically receive fixed fees or percentages of ticket sales as well as percentages of total concession sales from the vendors and percentages of total merchandise sales from the merchandisers 

 

industry participants including ourselves often perform one or more of the booking promotion and venue operation functions 

 

theatrical industry 

 

the theatrical industry includes groups engaged in promoting which is generally referred to in the theater industry as “presenting” and producing live theatrical presentations as well as operating venues our main north american competitors in the theatrical industry include nederlander producing company of america mirvish productions the shubert organization the walt disney company and jujamcyn theaters as well as smaller regional players in europe our competitors include cameron mackintosh really useful theater group and ambassadors theatre group as well as smaller regional players 

 

according to data from members of the league of american theatres and producers inc or the league gross ticket sales for the north american theatrical industry of touring broadway theatrical performances has increased from 642 million during the 20022003 season to 934 million during the 20042005 season a compounded annual growth rate of 21 in the 2003 to 2005 period our global theater revenues slightly decreased from 3182 million to 3170 million based on fewer profitable shows that we had the rights to present 

 

live theater consists mainly of productions of existing musicals and dramatic works and the development of new works while musicals require greater investments of time and capital than dramatic productions they are more likely to become touring theatrical shows for existing musicals 12 to 24 months typically elapse between producers’ acquisitions of theatrical stage rights and the first performances during this time the producers assemble touring companies and ready the shows for tours in comparison dramatic productions typically have smaller production budgets shorter preproduction periods lower operating costs and tend to occupy smaller theaters for shorter runs as compared to musicals 

 

producers of touring theatrical shows first acquire the rights to works from their owners who typically receive royalty payments in return producers then assemble casts hire directors and arrange for the design and construction of sets and costumes producers also arrange transportation and schedule shows with local presenters local presenters who generally operate or have relationships with venues provide all local services such as selling tickets hiring local personnel buying advertising and paying fixed guarantees to producers presenters then have the right to recover the guarantees plus their local costs from ticket revenues presenters and producers share any remaining ticket revenues north american venues often sell tickets for touring theatrical performances through “subscription series” which are presold season tickets for a defined number of shows in given venues 

 

in order to secure exclusive touring rights investors may take equity positions in broadway new york or west end london shows touring rights are generally granted to investors for three to four years after investors have received complete return of their investments net profits are generally split between the limited partners and producers 

 

other 

 

specialized motor sports industry 

 

the specialized motor sports industry includes promoters and producers of specialized motor sports events as well as venue operators typical events include motorcycle road racing supercross racing monster truck shows freestyle motocross events and other similar events our main competitors in the specialized motor sports industry are primarily smaller regional promoters on a broader level we compete against other 

outdoor motor sports such as the national association for stock car auto racing or nascar and the indy racing league or irl in the united states 

 

in general most suitable markets where we operate host one to four motor sports events each year with larger markets hosting more performances venue operators of stadiums and arenas typically work with producers and promoters to schedule individual events or full seasons of events corporate sponsorships and television exposure are important financial components that contribute to the success of a single event or a season of events 

 

specialized motor sports events make up a growing segment of the live entertainment industry this growth has resulted from additional demand in existing markets and new demand in markets where arenas and stadiums have been built the increasing popularity of specialized motor sports over the last several years has coincided with the increased popularity of other professional motor sports events such as professional auto racing including nascar and irl a number of events are also broadcast domestically and internationally 

 

sports representation industry 

 

the sports representation industry generally encompasses the negotiation of player contracts and the creation and evaluation of endorsement promotional and other business opportunities for clients sports agents may also provide ancillary services such as financial advisory or management services to their clients our primary competition in the sports representation industry are other sports representation agencies such as international management group or img octagon worldwide and gaylord sports management as well as regional agencies and individual agents

sports representation our sports representation business specializes in the negotiation of professional sports contracts and endorsement contracts for clients our clients have endorsed numerous products both domestically and internationally for many high profile companies the amount of endorsement and other revenues that our clients generate is a function of among other things the clients’ professional performances and public appeal

our goal is to increase shareholder value by maximizing our cash flow from operations to accomplish this goal our strategy is to acquire and distribute content through our global network and pursue all revenue lines that transpire from the live event this is to be achieved through 

 

  

competition 

 

competition in the live entertainment industry is intense we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to deliver quality entertainment products and enhanced fan experiences from music concerts touring theatrical performances and specialized motor sports events including 

 

  

although we believe that our entertainment products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors we cannot provide any assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors especially those with significantly greater brand recognition financial marketing service support technical and other resources 

 

global music in the markets in which we promote musical concerts we face competition from promoters as well as from certain artists that promote their own concerts we believe that barriers to entry into the promotion services business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations in markets where we own or operate a venue we compete with other venues to serve artists likely to perform in that general region in markets where we do not own or operate venues we compete with other venues and promoters for popular tours consequently touring artists have significant alternatives to our venues in scheduling tours 

our main competitors in the north american live music industry include aeg live and house of blues entertainment in addition to numerous smaller regional companies and various casinos in the united states and europe some of our competitors in the live music industry have a stronger presence in certain markets and have access to other sports and entertainment assets as well as greater financial resources and brand recognition which may enable them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

 

global theater we compete with other presenters to obtain presentation arrangements with venues and performing arts organizations in various markets including markets with more than one venue suitable for presenting a touring or other theatrical show we compete with other new york and londonbased production companies for the rights to produce particular shows as a producer of broadway and west end shows we compete with producers of other theatrical performances for box office sales talent and theater space as the producer of a touring show we compete with producers of other touring or other theatrical performances to book the production in desirable presentation markets 

 

our main competitors in the global theatrical industry include nederlander producing company of america mirvish productions the shubert organization the walt disney company and jujamcyn theaters some of our competitors in the theatrical industry operate more theaters and have more broadway show interests than we do in new york city from which most north american theatrical touring productions originate in addition these competitors may have significantly greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources which could enable them to strengthen their competitive positions against us 

 

other our main competitors in the specialized motor sports industry are primarily smaller regional promoters on a broader level we compete against other outdoor motor sports such as nascar and irl in the united states some of our competitors in the specialized motor sports industry such as nascar enjoy stronger brand recognition and larger revenues in the motor sports industry than we do and may have greater financial and other resources enabling them to gain a greater competitive advantage in relation to us 

 

our primary competition in sports representation includes numerous agencies such as img octagon and gaylord as well as regional agencies and individual agents some of our competitors in the sports representation industry have a stronger international presence than we do in the sports representation business as well as larger television sports programming and distribution capabilities

government regulations 

 

we are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

we believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling preparation and serving of food including in some cases requirements relating to the temperature of food the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of foodhandling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 

 

we also must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 

 

we are also required to comply with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 or the ada the united kingdom’s disability discrimination act 1995 or the dda and certain state statutes and local ordinances that among other things require that places of public accommodation including both existing and newly constructed venues be accessible to customers with disabilities the ada and dda require that venues be constructed to permit persons with disabilities full use of a live entertainment venue the ada and dda may also require that certain modifications be made to existing venues in order to make them accessible to patrons and employees who are disabled in order to comply with the ada dda and other similar ordinances we may face substantial capital expenditures in the future 

 

from time to time state and federal governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an affect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live entertainment events for entertainment taxes and for other incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

employees 

 

at december 31 2005 we had approximately 3000 fulltime employees including 1700 domestic and 1300 international employees of which approximately 2900 were employed in our operations departments and approximately 100 were employed in our corporate area we expect to hire additional employees in our corporate area as we transition to providing services that were and still are being provided to us by clear channel communications under a transitional services agreement as discussed above 

 

our staffing needs vary significantly throughout the year therefore we also from time to time employ parttime or seasonal employees at december 31 2005 we employed approximately 3700 seasonal parttime employees and during peak seasonal periods particularly in the summer months we have employed as many as 15900 parttime employees the stagehands at some of our venues and the actors musicians and others involved in some of our business operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business we believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees and other unionized labor involved in our events and there have been no significant work stoppages in the past three years upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations at one or more of our facilities may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our produced or presented events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses or that caps on agents’ fees will have on the revenues and operating income of our sports representation business

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report the following risks relate principally to our leverage our business our common stock and our separation from clear channel communications the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business if any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline 

 

risks associated with our leverage 

 

we have a large amount of debt redeemable preferred stock and lease obligations that could restrict our operations and impair our financial condition 

 

our total indebtedness for borrowed money including our redeemable preferred stock was approximately 4068 million at december 31 2005 our current available borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facility is approximately 6100 million consisting of our 3250 million term loan facility all of which 

is outstanding and our 2850 million revolving credit facility none of which is outstanding with sublimits up to 2350 million available for letters of credit at december 31 2005 outstanding letters of credit were approximately 464 million leaving total available credit of 2386 million for future borrowings we may also incur additional substantial indebtedness in the future 

 

our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences including 

 

  

in addition our redeemable preferred stock bears an annual dividend rate of 13 or 52 million annually and is subject to financial and other covenants substantially similar to the covenants applicable to our senior secured credit facility if we default under any of these covenants we will have to pay additional dividends 

 

in addition as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 10 billion in operating lease agreements of which approximately 643 million is due in 2006 and 607 million is due in 2007 

 

if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt redeemable preferred stock or lease obligations we may be forced to sell assets seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt however these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt redeemable preferred stock or lease service obligations we may be unable to restructure or refinance our obligations and obtain additional equity financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms or at all as a result the inability to meet our debt redeemable preferred stock or lease obligations could cause us to default on those obligations if we fail to meet any minimum financial requirements contained in instruments governing our debt we would be in default under such instruments which in turn could result in defaults under other debt instruments in addition if we default under any of the covenants applicable to our preferred stock we will have to pay additional dividends any such defaults could materially impair our financial condition and liquidity see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our obligations 

 

to service our debt lease and preferred stock obligations and to fund potential capital expenditures we will require a significant amount of cash to meet our needs which depends on many factors beyond our control 

 

our ability to service our debt lease and preferred stock obligations and to fund potential capital expenditures for venue construction expansion or renovation will require a significant amount of cash which depends on many factors beyond our control our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt including our senior secured credit facility will also depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to an extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs as of december 31 2005 approximately 257 million of total indebtedness excluding interest is due in 2006 91 million is due in the aggregate for 2007 and 2008 94 million is due in the aggregate for 2009 and 2010 and 3626 million is due thereafter see the table in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — contractual obligations and commitments — firm commitments if our future cash flow from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs we may be forced to reduce or delay our business 

activities and capital expenditures sell assets obtain additional equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity we may be limited on assets we can sell under the terms of the tax matters agreement with clear channel communications we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms if at all in addition the terms of our existing debt including our senior secured credit facility other future debt and our preferred stock may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources 

 

our senior secured credit facility and preferred stock designations may restrict our ability to finance operations and capital needs and our operating flexibility 

 

our senior secured credit facility and preferred stock designations include restrictive covenants that among other things restrict our ability to 

 

  

in addition our senior secured credit facility and preferred stock designations include additional restrictions including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios our failure to comply with the terms and covenants in our indebtedness could lead to a default under the terms of those documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate the indebtedness and declare all amounts owed due and payable if we default under any of the covenants applicable to our preferred stock the holder of our preferred stock may be entitled to elect a director of one of our subsidiaries and we will have to pay additional dividends 

 

risk factors relating to our business 

 

our live entertainment business is highly sensitive to public tastes and dependent on our ability to secure popular artists and other live entertainment events and we may be unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences which may result in decreased demand for our services 

 

our ability to generate revenues from our entertainment operations is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes and dependent on the availability of popular artists and events our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them since we rely on unrelated parties to create and perform live entertainment content any unwillingness to tour or lack of availability of popular artists touring theatrical performances specialized motor sports talent and other performers could limit our ability to generate revenues in addition we typically book our live music tours one to four months in advance of the beginning of the tour and often agree to pay an artist a fixed guaranteed amount prior to our receiving any operating income therefore if the public is not receptive to the tour or we or a performer cancel the tour we may incur a loss for the tour depending on the amount of the fixed guarantee or incurred costs relative to any revenues earned as well as foregone revenue we could have earned at booked venues furthermore consumer preferences change from time to time and our failure to anticipate identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our services which would adversely affect our operating results and profitability 

we have incurred net losses and may experience future net losses 

 

our operating results have been adversely affected by among other things a global economic slowdown increased cost of entertainers and a decline in the number of live entertainment events we incurred a net loss of approximately 1306 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and generated net income of approximately 163 million and 570 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively we may face reduced demand for our live entertainment events and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the future we cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods 

 

our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter so our financial performance in certain financial quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters 

 

we believe our financial results and cash needs will vary greatly from quarter to quarter depending on among other things the timing of tours and theatrical productions tour cancellations capital expenditures seasonal and other fluctuations in our operating results the timing of guaranteed payments and receipt of ticket sales financing activities acquisitions and investments and receivables management because our results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter our financial results for one quarter cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters typically our global music segment experiences its lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as our outdoor venues are primarily used during may through september our global theater segment experiences its strongest demand in the first second and fourth quarters of the calendar year as the theatrical touring season runs during september through april in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted 

 

the following table sets forth our operating income loss for the last eight fiscal quarters in thousands 

 

 

 

we may be adversely affected by a general deterioration in economic conditions which could affect consumer and corporate spending and therefore significantly adversely impact our operating results 

 

a decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of live entertainment events has had an adverse effect on our revenues and operating income in addition during the most recent economic slowdown in the united states many consumers reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers reduced their advertising expenditures the impact of slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict but they may result in reductions in ticket sales sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenues the risks associated with our businesses become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment events 

 

our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending many factors related to corporate spending and discretionary consumer spending including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment fuel prices interest and tax rates and inflation can significantly impact our operating results business conditions as well as various industry conditions including corporate 

marketing and promotional spending and interest levels can also significantly impact our operating results these factors can affect attendance at our events premium seats sponsorship advertising and hospitality spending concession and souvenir sales as well as the financial results of sponsors of our venues events and the industry negative factors such as challenging economic conditions public concerns over additional terrorism and security incidents particularly when combined can impact corporate and consumer spending and one negative factor can impact our results more than another there can be no assurance that consumer and corporate spending will not be adversely impacted by economic conditions thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

 

loss of our key management and other personnel could impact our business 

 

our business is dependent upon our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business the loss of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations due to their associations and contacts with performers and other key industry agents venue managers and sponsors although we have entered into longterm agreements with some of our key executive officers and other personnel to protect our interests in those relationships we can give no assurance that all or any of these key employees will remain with us or will retain their associations with key business contacts 

 

doing business in foreign countries creates certain risks not found in doing business in the united states 

 

doing business in foreign countries involves certain risks that may not exist when doing business in the united states for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 our international operations accounted for approximately 31 and 28 respectively of our revenues during those periods the risks involved in foreign operations that could result in losses against which we are not insured include 

 

  

in addition we may incur substantial tax liabilities if we repatriate any of the cash generated by our international operations back to the united states due to our current inability to recognize any foreign tax credits that would be associated with such repatriation we are not currently in a position to recognize any tax assets in the united states that are the result of payments of income or withholding taxes in foreign jurisdictions 

exchange rates may cause fluctuations in our results of operations that are not related to our operations 

 

because we own assets overseas and derive revenues from our international operations we may incur currency translation losses or gains due to changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 our international operations accounted for approximately 31 and 28 respectively of our revenues during those periods in addition our international operations have accounted for approximately 63 of our operating income in prior years although we cannot predict the future relationship between the united states dollar and the currencies used by our international businesses principally the british pound and the euro for the year ended december 31 2005 we experienced a foreign exchange rate net loss of 13 million which had a negative effect on our operating income while for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 we experienced foreign exchange rate net gains of 63 million and 76 million respectively for those periods which had a positive effect on our operating income see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk — foreign currency risk 

 

we may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors if any which may have an adverse effect on our business our compliance with antitrust competition and other regulations may limit our operations and future acquisitions 

 

our future growth rate depends in part on our selective acquisition of additional businesses we may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or make acquisitions at favorable prices if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and requisite government approvals 

 

acquisitions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations financial reporting technologies and personnel of acquired companies managing geographically dispersed operations the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits acquisitions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

 

we are also subject to laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust that could significantly affect our ability to expand our business through acquisitions for example the federal trade commission and the antitrust division of the united states department of justice with respect to our domestic acquisitions and the european commission the antitrust regulator of the european union with respect to our european acquisitions have the authority to challenge our acquisitions on antitrust grounds before or after the acquisitions are completed state agencies may also have standing to challenge these acquisitions under state or federal antitrust law comparable authorities in foreign countries also have the ability to challenge our foreign acquisitions our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in among other things regulatory actions or legal proceedings against us the imposition of fines penalties or judgments against us or significant limitations on our activities in addition the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change new or revised requirements imposed by governmental regulatory authorities could have adverse effects on us including increased costs of compliance we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities 

 

in addition restrictions contained in the tax matters agreement between us and clear channel and the credit agreement for the senior secured credit facility restrict our ability to make acquisitions 

there is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live entertainment events which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses as well as reduce attendance at our live entertainment events causing a decrease in our revenues 

 

there are inherent risks involved with producing live entertainment events as a result personal injuries and accidents have and may occur from time to time which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries incidents in connection with our live entertainment events at any of our venues or venues that we rent could also result in claims reducing operating income or reducing attendance at our events causing a decrease in our revenues we are currently subject to wrongful death claims as well as other litigation while we maintain insurance polices that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient in management’s judgment to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or accidents in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 

 

costs associated with and our ability to obtain adequate insurance could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 

 

heightened concerns and challenges regarding property casualty liability business interruption and other insurance coverage have resulted from the terrorist and related security incidents on and after september 11 2001 in the united states as well as the more recent terrorist attacks in madrid and london as a result we may experience increased difficulty obtaining high policy limits of coverage at reasonable costs including coverage for acts of terrorism we have a material investment in property and equipment at each of our venues which are generally located near highly populated cities and which hold events typically attended by large numbers of fans at december 31 2005 we had property and equipment with a net book value of approximately 8089 million 

 

these operational geographical and situational factors among others have resulted in and may continue to result in significant increases in insurance premium costs and difficulties obtaining sufficiently high policy limits with deductibles that we believe to be reasonable we cannot assure you that future increases in insurance costs and difficulties obtaining high policy limits will not adversely impact our profitability thereby possibly impacting our operating results and growth 

 

we cannot guarantee that our insurance policy coverage limits including insurance coverage for property casualty liability and business interruption losses and acts of terrorism would be adequate under the circumstances should one or multiple events occur at or near any of our venues or that our insurers would have adequate financial resources to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages we cannot guarantee that adequate coverage limits will be available offered at reasonable costs or offered by insurers with sufficient financial soundness the occurrence of such an incident or incidents affecting any one or more of our venues could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future results of operations if asset damage andor company liability were to exceed insurance coverage limits or if an insurer were unable to sufficiently or fully pay our related claims or damages 

 

costs associated with capital improvements could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 

 

growth or maintenance of our existing revenues depends in part on consistent investment in our venues therefore we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our venues to meet longterm increasing demand to increase entertainment value and to increase revenues we frequently have a number of significant capital projects under way numerous factors many of which are beyond our control may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our venues including 

 

 23 

 

  

the amount of capital expenditures can vary significantly from year to year in addition actual costs could vary materially from our estimates if the factors listed above and our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change construction is also subject to governmental permitting processes which if changed could materially affect the ultimate cost 

 

we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our live entertainment venue operations are subject to federal state and local laws both domestically and internationally governing matters such as construction renovation and operation of our venues as well as 

 

  

while we believe that our venues are in material compliance with these laws we cannot predict the extent to which any future laws or regulations will impact our operations the regulations relating to our food and support service in our venues are many and complex although we generally contract with a thirdparty vendor for these services at our operated venues we cannot assure you that we or our thirdparty vendors are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we or our thirdparty vendors will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or that we will not be held liable for violations by thirdparty vendors furthermore additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance 

 

we also serve alcoholic beverages at many of our venues during live entertainment events and must comply with applicable licensing laws as well as state and local service laws commonly called dram shop statutes dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor if we violate dram shop laws we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron although we generally hire outside vendors to provide these services at our operated venues and regularly sponsor training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us there can be no assurance that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance we must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the states in which we serve alcoholic beverages 

 

from time to time state and federal governmental bodies have proposed legislation that could have an effect on our business for example some legislatures have proposed laws in the past that would impose 

potential liability on us and other promoters and producers of live entertainment events for entertainment taxes and for incidents that occur at our events particularly relating to drugs and alcohol 

 

in addition we and our venues are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the use storage disposal emission and release of hazardous and nonhazardous substances as well as zoning and noise level restrictions which may affect among other things the hours of operations of our venues 

 

we face intense competition in the live entertainment industry and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenues which could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

our business segments are in highly competitive industries and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current live entertainment revenues we compete in the global music and global theater industries and within such industries we compete with other venues to book performers and in the markets in which we promote musical concerts we face competition from other promoters as well as from certain performers who promote their own concerts our competitors also compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours these competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts undertake more farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists our competitors may develop services advertising options or entertainment venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve it is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share other variables that could adversely affect our financial performance by among other things leading to decreases in overall revenues the numbers of advertising customers event attendance ticket prices or profit margins include 

 

  

we believe that barriers to entry into the live entertainment promotion business are low and that certain local promoters are increasingly expanding the geographic scope of their operations 

 

we depend upon unionized labor for the provision of some of our services and any work stoppages or labor disturbances could disrupt our business 

 

the stagehands at some of our venues and the actors musicians and others involved in some of our business operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements our union agreements typically have a term of three years and thus regularly expire and require negotiation in the course of our business upon the expiration of any of our collective bargaining agreements however we may be unable to negotiate new 

collective bargaining agreements on terms favorable to us and our business operations may be interrupted as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating our collective bargaining agreements a work stoppage at one or more of our owned or operated venues or at our produced or presented events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we cannot predict the effect that new collective bargaining agreements will have on our expenses or that caps on agents’ fees will have on the revenues and operating income of our sports representation business 

 

we are dependent upon our ability to lease acquire and develop live entertainment venues and if we are unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

we require access to venues to generate revenues from live entertainment events for these events we use venues that we own but we also operate a number of our live entertainment venues under various agreements which include leases with thirdparties or equity or booking agreements which are agreements where we contract to book the events at a venue for a specific period of time our longterm success in the live entertainment business will depend in part on the availability of venues our ability to lease these venues and our ability to enter into booking agreements upon their expiration as many of these agreements are with third parties over whom we have little or no control we may be unable to renew these agreements or enter into new agreements on acceptable terms or at all and may be unable to obtain favorable agreements with venues our ability to renew these agreements or obtain new agreements on favorable terms depends on a number of other factors many of which are also beyond our control such as national and local business conditions and competition from other promoters if the cost of renewing these agreements is too high or the terms of any new agreement with a new venue are unacceptable or incompatible with our existing operations we may decide to forego these opportunities there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we plan to continue to expand our operations through the development of live entertainment venues and the expansion of existing live entertainment venues which poses a number of risks including 

 

  

additionally the market potential of live entertainment venues sites cannot be precisely determined and our live entertainment venues may face competition in markets from unexpected sources newly constructed live entertainment venues may not perform up to our expectations we face significant competition for potential live entertainment venue locations and for opportunities to acquire existing live entertainment venues because of this competition we may be unable to add to the number of our live entertainment venues on terms we consider acceptable 

 

our revenues depend in part on the promotional success of our marketing campaigns and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenues or profits 

 

similar to many companies we spend significant amounts on advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns for our live entertainment events and other business activities such marketing activities include among others promotion of ticket sales premium seat sales hospitality and other services for our events and venues and advertising associated with our distribution of related souvenir merchandise and apparel in the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 we spent approximately 61 and 69 respectively of our revenues on marketing including advertising and there can be no assurance that such advertising promotional and other marketing campaigns will be successful or will generate revenues or profits 

poor weather adversely affects attendance at our live entertainment events which could negatively impact our financial performance from period to period 

 

we promote many live entertainment events weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets concessions and souvenirs among other things poor weather conditions can have a material effect on our results of operations particularly because we promote a finite number of events due to weather conditions we may be required to reschedule an event to the next available day or a different venue which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively impact the attendance at the event as well as food beverage and merchandise sales poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods if we are unable to reschedule events due to poor weather we are forced to refund the tickets for those events 

 

increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly affect our results of operations 

 

the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended require changes in our corporate governance and securities disclosure and compliance practices and require a review of our internal control procedures we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs in addition they could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers finally director and officer liability insurance for public companies like us has become more difficult and more expensive to obtain and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur higher costs to obtain coverage that is satisfactory to us and our officers or directors we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude or additional costs we may incur as a result 

 

if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our stock price may suffer 

 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the united states securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting to comply with this statute we will be required to document and test our internal control procedures our management will be required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors will be required to issue an opinion on management’s assessment of those matters our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act will first be tested in connection with the filing of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending december 31 2006 the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are new and complex and require significant documentation testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules during the course of its testing our management may identify material weaknesses or deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanesoxley act if our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal control investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and our stock price may suffer 

 

we may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks 

 

the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events such as terrorist attacks intentional or unintentional masscasualty incidents natural disasters or similar events may substantially decrease the use of and demand for our services and the attendance at live entertainment events which may decrease our revenues or expose us to substantial liability the terrorism and security incidents of september 11 2001 military actions in iraq and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have raised numerous challenging operating factors including public concerns regarding air travel military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents causing a nationwide disruption of commercial and leisure activities 

following september 11 2001 some artists refused to travel or book tours which adversely affected our music business and many people did not travel to new york city which caused us to experience lower attendance levels at our theatrical performances playing on broadway in new york city and adversely affected our theatrical business the occurrence of the 2005 terrorist attacks in london england also caused us to experience lower attendance levels at our theatrical performances playing on the west end in london the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks military actions by the united states contagious disease outbreaks natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe floods or similar events cannot be predicted and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies of the united states and other foreign countries where we do business generally specifically the market for live entertainment 

 

risks relating to our common stock 

 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade 

 

the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

in particular the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of the value of your common stock 

 

in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations this volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including companies in our industry the changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price 

 

in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them if a suit were to be filed against us regardless of the outcome 

it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our corporate governance documents rights agreement and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that shareholders may consider favorable which could decrease the value of your shares 

 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors these provisions include restrictions on the ability of our shareholders to remove directors and supermajority voting requirements for shareholders to amend our organizational documents a classified board of directors and limitations on action by our shareholders by written consent three of our nine directors are directors of clear channel communications in addition our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer delaware law for instance also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 or more of our outstanding common stock and us although we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders 

 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that subject to any written agreement to the contrary which agreement does not currently exist clear channel communications will have no duty to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us or doing business with any of our customers or vendors or employing or otherwise engaging or soliciting any of our officers directors or employees our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if clear channel communications acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and clear channel communications we will generally renounce our interest in the corporate opportunity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation renounces any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunity that will belong to clear channel communications clear channel communications will to the fullest extent permitted by law have satisfied its fiduciary duty with respect to such a corporate opportunity and will not be liable to us or our shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as our shareholder by reason of the fact that it acquires or seeks the corporate opportunity for itself directs that corporate opportunity to another person or does not present that corporate opportunity to us these provisions could make an acquisition of us less advantageous to a thirdparty 

 

our obligation to indemnify under certain circumstances clear channel communications and its affiliates pursuant to the tax matters agreement against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the spinoff to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code could deter a change of control of us 

 

we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan intended to deter hostile or coercive attempts to acquire us under the plan if any person or group acquires or begins a tender or exchange offer that could result in such person acquiring 15 or more of our common stock and in the case of certain schedule 13g filers 20 or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors under specified circumstances our other shareholders have the right to purchase shares of our common stock or shares of the acquiring company at a substantial discount to the public market price therefore the plan makes an acquisition much more costly to a potential acquirer 

 

in addition the terms of our senior secured credit facility provide that the lenders can require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness upon a change of control and the preferred stock requires one of our subsidiaries to offer to repurchase the preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference upon a change of control these provisions make an acquisition more costly to a potential acquirer see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources — redeemable preferred stock 

risks relating to our separation from clear channel communications 

 

the cost of certain corporate functions necessary to operate as an independent company previously provided by clear channel communications may increase 

 

prior to the separation our business was operated by clear channel communications as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company our historical consolidated and combined financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from clear channel communications those allocations may be less than the comparable expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publiclytraded company clear channel communications performed various corporate functions for us including but not limited to 

 

  

as we implement these functions the costs may be higher than previous years’ allocations or current estimates and our losses may increase as a result of the separation neither clear channel communications nor any of its affiliates has any obligation to provide these functions to us other than those services that clear channel communications provides pursuant to the transition services agreement see item 13 certain transactions and related party transactions — our relationship with clear channel communications — transition services agreement if once our transition services agreement terminates we do not have in place our own systems and business functions we do not have agreements with other providers of these services or we are not able to make these changes cost effectively we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our losses may increase if clear channel communications does not continue to perform effectively the services that are required under the transition services agreement we may not be able to operate our business effectively 

 

we have a short operating history as a separate publiclytraded company and our historical combined and consolidated financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

 

on december 21 2005 we were spunoff from clear channel communications and therefore we have minimal operating history as a separate publiclytraded company the historical consolidated and combined financial information included in this form 10k does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows we would have achieved as a separate publiclytraded company during the periods presented or those we will achieve in the future this is primarily a result of the following factors 

 

 30 

 

  

the separation could result in significant tax liability to our initial public shareholders 

 

clear channel communications received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service substantially to the effect that the distribution of our common stock to its shareholders qualifies as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code although a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service generally is binding on the internal revenue service if the factual representations or assumptions made in the letter ruling request are untrue or incomplete in any material respect we will not be able to rely on the ruling 

 

furthermore the internal revenue service will not rule on whether a distribution satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code rather the ruling is based upon representations by clear channel communications that these conditions have been satisfied and any inaccuracy in such representations could invalidate the ruling therefore in addition to obtaining the ruling from the internal revenue service clear channel communications made it a condition to the separation that clear channel communications obtain an opinion of skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp that the distribution will qualify as a taxfree distribution for united states federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the opinion relies on the ruling as to matters covered by the ruling in addition the opinion is based on among other things certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by clear channel communications and us which if incorrect or inaccurate in any material respect would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and the internal revenue service or the courts may not agree with the opinion 

 

notwithstanding receipt by clear channel communications of the ruling and opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position our initial public shareholders could be subject to significant united states federal income tax liability in general our initial public shareholders could be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of our common stock that was distributed to them 

 

the separation could result in significant taxrelated liabilities to us 

 

as discussed above notwithstanding receipt by clear channel communications of the ruling and the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service could assert that the distribution does not qualify for taxfree treatment for united states federal income tax purposes if the internal revenue service were successful in taking this position clear channel communications could be subject to significant united states federal 

income tax liability in general clear channel communications would be subject to tax as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value in addition even if the distribution otherwise were to qualify under section 355 of the code it may be taxable to clear channel communications as if it had sold the common stock of our company in a taxable sale for its fair market value under section 355e of the code if the distribution were later deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 or greater interest in clear channel communications or us for this purpose any acquisitions of clear channel communications stock or of our stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although we or clear channel communications may be able to rebut that presumption 

 

although such corporatelevel taxes if any resulting from a taxable distribution generally would be imposed on clear channel communications we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel communications and its affiliates against taxrelated liabilities if any caused by the failure of the separation to qualify as a taxfree transaction under section 355 of the code including as a result of section 355e of the code if the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions events or transactions relating to our stock assets or business or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by us in the tax matters agreement if the failure of the separation to qualify under section 355 of the code is for any reason for which neither we nor clear channel communications is responsible we and clear channel communications have agreed in the tax matters agreement that we will each be responsible for 50 of the taxrelated liabilities arising from the failure to so qualify clear channel communications reported a 24 billion capital loss as a result of the separation see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions — our relationship with clear channel communications — tax matters agreement for a more detailed discussion of the tax matters agreement between clear channel communications and us 

 

we could be liable for income taxes owed by clear channel communications 

 

each member of the clear channel communications consolidated group which includes clear channel communications our company and our subsidiaries through december 21 2005 and clear channel communications’ other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the united states federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group consequently we could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the clear channel communications consolidated group disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service in amounts that we cannot quantify in addition clear channel communications has recognized a capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes in connection with the separation if clear channel communications is unable to deduct such capital loss for united states federal income tax purposes as a result of any action we take following the separation or our breach of a relevant representation or covenant made by us in the tax matters agreement we have agreed in the tax matters agreement to indemnify clear channel communications for the lost tax benefits that clear channel communications would have otherwise realized if it were able to deduct this loss see item 13 certain relationships and related transactions — our relationship with clear channel communications — tax matters agreement

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend

executive overview 

 

our global music business experienced an increase in international revenues primarily due to acquisitions of promoters and increased ticket prices and attendance at our international festivals this was partially offset by a decline in the number of events across our domestic amphitheaters as compared to 2004 which resulted in a decline in total attendance this segment was also affected by increased litigation expenses severance and other reorganization costs 

 

our global theater business expanded its venue network during 2005 through acquisitions but overall experienced reduced attendance and show profits this segment was also impacted by increased writeoffs of advances on theater productions severance and other reorganization costs during 2005 

 

our other operations business experienced an increase in divisional operating expenses due to increased litigation expenses as well as severance and other reorganization costs the impact of these items was offset by growth in the motor sports business due to additional demand in existing markets and new demand in markets where arenas and stadiums have been built

our business activities 

 

we principally act in the following capacities performing one some or all of these roles in connection with our events and tours 

 

venue operation as a venue operator we contract with promoters to rent our venues for events and provide related services such as concessions merchandising parking security ushering and tickettaking we generate revenues primarily from rental income ticket service charges premium seating and 

venue sponsorships as well as sharing in percentages of concessions merchandise and parking revenues generated from venue operations which are partially driven by attendance typically have a higher margin than promotion or production revenues and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

 

sponsorships and advertising we actively pursue the sale of national and local sponsorships and placement of advertising including signage promotional programs naming of subscription series and tour sponsorships many of our venues also have nameintitle sponsorship programs we believe national sponsorships allow us to maximize our network of venues and to arrange multivenue branding opportunities for advertisers our national sponsorship programs have included companies such as american express anheuser busch and cocacola our local and venuefocused sponsorships include venue signage promotional programs onsite activation hospitality and tickets and are derived from a variety of companies across various industry categories revenues generated from sponsorships and advertising typically have a significantly higher margin than promotion or production revenues and therefore typically have a more direct relationship to operating income 

 

promotion as a promoter we typically book performers arrange performances and tours secure venues provide for thirdparty production services sell tickets and advertise events to attract audiences we earn revenues primarily from the sale of tickets and pay performers under one of several formulas including a fixed guaranteed amount andor a percentage of ticket sales for each event we either use a venue we own or operate or rent a thirdparty venue in our global theater business we generally refer to promotion as presentation revenues related to promotion activities represent the majority of our consolidated and combined revenues these revenues are generally related to the volume of ticket sales and ticket prices event costs included in divisional operating expenses such as artist and production service expenses are typically substantial in relation to the revenues as a result significant increases or decreases in promotion revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income 

 

production as a producer we generally develop event content hire directors and artistic talent develop sets and costumes and coordinate the actual performances of the events we produce tours on a global national and regional basis we generate revenues from fixed producer fees and by sharing in a percentage of event or tour profits primarily related to the sale of tickets merchandise and event and tour sponsorships these production revenues are generally related to the size and profitability of the production production costs included in divisional operating expenses are typically substantial in relation to the revenues as a result significant increases or decreases in production revenue do not typically result in comparable changes to operating income

the increases and decreases in interest expense with clear channel communications are directly related to the respective increase or decrease in average debt outstanding as the rate charged remained relatively consistent throughout the periods as of december 21 2005 this debt was repaid to or contributed to our capital by clear channel communications

income taxes 

 

current tax benefit for the fiscal year 2005 decreased 29 million as compared to the fiscal year 2004 deferred tax expense increased 601 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase in deferred tax expense is primarily due to the 773 million valuation reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 and subsequent to our separation from clear channel communications related to our deferred tax asset as a subsidiary of clear channel communications taxable losses of our subsidiaries were able to be utilized under a consolidated income tax return with clear channel communications after the separation our deferred tax asset had to be evaluated on a standalone basis based on prior historical taxable income since we have had a history of taxable losses we recorded a valuation allowance against this asset 

 

current tax benefit decreased 123 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies current tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2004 was reduced approximately 110 million the decrease in deferred tax expense of 252 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to december 31 2003 was due primarily to additional depreciation expense deductions taken for tax purposes associated with a change in our tax lives of certain assets the additional depreciation expense resulted in an increase in deferred tax expense in 2003 

 

global music results of operations 

 

our global music operating results were as follows 

 

 

fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 

 

global music revenue increased 1203 million or 5 during 2005 as compared to 2004 driven primarily by an increase of 1267 million in our international revenues partially offset by a decline in our domestic revenues the increase in our international revenues is primarily due to the acquisition of international promotion companies during the second half of 2004 the acquisition of a festival promoter and venue operator in 2005 an increase in promotion revenue related to shows with higher ticket prices and an increase in the attendance at our international festivals our international music revenue increase was partially offset by a 64 million decrease in domestic revenues during 2005 the decline in our domestic music revenue was primarily the result of a reduction in the number of domestic events which reduced attendance and lower ticket prices while the total attendance declined at our domestic amphitheaters the average per show attendance at these venues actually increased 7 we believe that this increase in average per show attendance was driven by a decrease in the average ticket price by 6 during 2005 

 

global music divisional operating expenses increased 1442 million or 7 during 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increases in our international and domestic divisional operation expenses of 1176 million and 266 million respectively the increase in divisional operating expenses is due primarily to the acquisition of international promotion companies during the second half of 2004 the acquisition of an international festival promoter and venue operator in 2005 an increase in international promotion activity and a 59 million writeoff of advances on certain domestic music projects in addition in 2005 we had 113 million of higher litigation contingencies and expenses and 122 million of costs related to severance and reorganization of the business 

 

depreciation and amortization increased by 24 million or 6 in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to accelerating depreciation on assets for which we have determined the useful life to be shorter than originally expected 

 

fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 

 

global music revenue increased 1312 million or 6 during 2004 as compared to 2003 approximately 576 million or 44 of the increase was attributable to foreign exchange rate increases the increase was also driven by an increased number of events and attendance in our international operations significant acts for 2004 included madonna and the italian tour of vasco rossi in addition revenue from global music sponsorships and premium seat sales increased in 2004 by 159 million or 12 over 2003 although domestic music revenue increased we had fewer domestic amphitheater events in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an unusually high number of show cancellations in 2004 as compared to 2003 attendance for 2004 in our owned and operated amphitheaters was lower than 2003 partially due to these cancellations in general the domestic music industry suffered a setback in 2004 and according to pollstar experienced a decline of approximately 3 as compared to 2003 in the number of tickets sold for the top 100 tours 

 

global music divisional operating expenses increased 1578 million or 8 during 2004 as compared to 2003 approximately 533 million or 34 of the increase was attributable to foreign exchange rate increases the increase also relates to variable promotion production and venue costs associated with the number and type of events in 2004 as compared to 2003 in addition domestic music experienced higher talent and production costs primarily due to higher artist guarantees without a proportional increase in revenue domestic music also completed a restructuring of operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 resulting in a staff reduction and an increase in severance costs 

 

depreciation and amortization increased by 18 million or 5 in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the completion of new venues placed in service in late 2003 and in 2004 

global theater results of operations 

 

our global theater operating results were as follows 

 

 

 

fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 

 

global theater revenue increased 31 million or 1 during 2005 as compared to 2004 approximately 16 million or 52 of the increase was attributable to foreign exchange rate increases in addition global theater expanded its venue network during 2005 with the acquisition of four theaters in spain which resulted in an increase in revenues 

 

global theater divisional operating expenses increased 248 million or 9 during 2005 as compared to 2004 approximately 16 million or 6 of the increase was attributable to foreign exchange rate increases the remaining increase primarily relates to 105 million of severance and other reorganization costs 13 million of increased litigation contingencies and expenses 54 million of writeoffs of advances on certain domestic theater productions and costs related to the new theaters in spain 

 

fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 

 

global theater revenues decreased 42 million or 1 during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to fewer domestic event dates and the replacement of a number of significant international production investments in 2003 with smaller interests in international productions in 2004 where we receive only investment earnings rather than consolidated production results these declines were partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange rates of approximately 104 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 as well as the positive impact to revenues associated with our opening of the renovated francemerrick center for performing arts and the boston opera house during 2004 

 

global theater divisional operating expenses declined 40 million or 1 during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a decrease in global theater revenues during 2004 as compared to 2003 included in this variance are foreign exchange rate increases of approximately 89 million 

 

global theater depreciation and amortization expense increased 15 million or 12 during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to foreign exchange rate increases of 10 million and the completion and opening of the boston opera house during 2004 

other results of operations 

 

our other operating results were as follows 

 

 

 

fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 

 

other revenues increased 74 million or 3 during 2005 as compared to 2004 the revenue increase is partially due to growth of existing and creation of new touring productions and increased sales of dvds growth in the revenue from our specialized motor sports events resulted from a slight increase in attendance and ticket prices these increases were offset by decreases related to the sale of the international leisure center business during the second quarter of 2004 as well as the popular titanic the artifact exhibit completing its run during the second quarter of 2004 

 

other divisional operating expenses increased 155 million or 5 during 2005 as compared to 2004 the increase relates to the growth in our specialized motor sports events and touring productions 56 million of severance and other reorganization costs and a 102 million increase in litigation contingencies and expenses in 2005 as compared to 2004 these increases were offset by decreases related to the sale of the international leisure center business during the second quarter of 2004 as well as the popular titanic the artifact exhibit completing its run during the second quarter of 2004 

 

other divisional depreciation and amortization expense decreased 14 million or 19 for 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily as a result of the sale of the international leisure center business during the second quarter of 2004 

 

other loss on sale of operating assets decreased 63 million during 2005 as compared to 2004 due primarily to the sale of our international leisure center operations during the second quarter of 2004 offset by the sale of certain exhibition and music publishing assets during the fourth quarter of 2005 

 

fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 

 

other revenues decreased 287 million or 9 during 2004 as compared to 2003 foreign exchange rate increases of approximately 63 million were offset by decreases relating to the divestiture of certain noncore businesses including our international leisure center business during the second quarter of 2004 and a television production business during 2003 in addition our exhibitions group experienced a reduction in revenues as the popular titanic the artifact exhibit completed its run during the second quarter of 2004 after a full year of operations in 2003 these revenue declines were partially offset by an increase in the amount of sponsorship sales during 2004 

 

other divisional operating expenses decreased 152 million or 5 during 2004 as compared to 2003 foreign exchange rate increases of approximately 58 million were offset by decreases relating to the noncore divestitures and conclusion of titanic the artifact exhibit as mentioned above

reconciliation of segment operating income loss 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes including acquisitions and capital expenditures have historically been funded primarily through an intercompany promissory note with clear channel communications subsequent to our separation from clear channel communications our working capital and other cash requirements are funded from operations or from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility described below our cash is currently managed on a worldwide basis repatriation of some of these funds could be subject to delay and could have potential tax consequences principally with respect to withholding taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions which do not give rise to a tax benefit in the united states due to our current inability to recognize the related deferred tax assets 

 

our historical balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 4037 million and shortterm and longterm debt of 3668 million at december 31 2005 and cash and cash equivalents of 1791 million and shortterm and longterm debt of 6507 million at december 31 2004 the increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2005 as compared to 2004 is due to 1070 million of cash remaining from our senior secured credit facility and higher cash in our international operations due to improved results of operations and timing of events 

 

we may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make strategic acquisitions or investments we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all our ability to issue additional equity may be constrained because our issuance of additional stock may cause the distribution to be taxable under section 355e of the code and under the tax matters agreement we would be required to indemnify clear channel communications against the tax if any we may make significant acquisitions in the near term subject to limitations imposed by our financing documents market conditions and the tax matters agreement 

 

we generally receive cash related to ticket revenues in advance of the event which is recorded in deferred income until the event occurs with the exception of some upfront costs and artist deposits which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs we pay the majority of event related expenses at or after the event 

 

our intrayear cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses examples of seasonal effects include our global music business which reports the majority of its revenues in the second and third quarters while our global theater business reports the majority of its revenues in the first second and fourth quarters of the year cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of eventrelated payments and generally occur prior to the event see “— seasonality” below we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts although there can be no assurance that this will be the case we expect cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility to satisfy working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year 

sources of cash 

 

senior secured credit facility 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had a 6100 million senior secured credit facility consisting of a 3250 million 7 1  2 year term loan and a 2850 million 6 1  2 year revolving credit facility the 6 1  2 year revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to the amount of the facility with sublimits of up to 2350 million to be available for the issuance of letters of credit and up to 1000 million to be available for borrowings in foreign currencies the term loan portion of the credit facility matures in june 2013 we are required to make minimum quarterly principal repayments under the term loan of approximately 32 million per year through march 2013 with the remaining balance due at maturity we are required to prepay the outstanding term loan subject to certain exceptions and conditions from certain asset sale proceeds and casualty and condemnation proceeds that we do not reinvest within a 365day period or from additional debt issuance proceeds the revolving credit portion of the credit facility matures in june 2012 at december 31 2005 the outstanding balances on the term loan and revolving credit facility were 3250 million and 0 respectively taking into account letters of credit of 464 million 2386 million was available for future borrowings

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the credit facility we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments as of december 31 2005 the commitment fee rate was 375 we also are required to pay customary letter of credit fees as necessary 

 

the senior secured credit facility contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional debt pay dividends and make distributions make certain investments and acquisitions repurchase our stock and prepay certain indebtedness create liens enter into agreements with affiliates modify the nature of our business enter into saleleaseback transactions transfer and sell material assets and merge or consolidate 

 

redeemable preferred stock 

 

as part of the separation a subsidiary of ours sold 200000 shares of series a voting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to thirdparty investors and issued 200000 shares of series b nonvoting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to clear channel communications who then sold this series b redeemable preferred stock to thirdparty investors we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the series b redeemable preferred stock sold by clear channel communications as of december 31 2005 we had 200000 shares of series a redeemable preferred stock and 200000 shares of series b redeemable preferred stock outstanding collectively the “preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of 400 million the preferred stock accrues dividends at 13 per annum and is mandatorily redeemable on 

december 21 2011 although we are obligated to make an offer to repurchase the preferred stock at 101 of the liquidation preference in the event of a change of control the certificate of incorporation governing the preferred stock contains a number of covenants that among other things restrict our ability to incur additional debt issue certain equity securities create liens merge or consolidate modify the nature of our business make certain investments and acquisitions transfer and sell material assets enter into saleleaseback transactions enter into swap agreements pay dividends and make distributions and enter into agreements with affiliates if we default under any of these covenants we will have to pay additional dividends 

 

guarantees of third party obligations 

 

as of december 31 2005 and 2004 we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately 19 million and 35 million respectively primarily related to maximum credit limits on employee credit cards and in 2004 this included a guarantee of a bank line of credit for working capital needs of a nonconsolidated affiliate 

 

debt covenants 

 

the significant covenants on our 6100 million 7 1  2 year multicurrency credit facility relate to total leverage senior leverage interest coverage and capital expenditures contained and defined in the credit agreement the leverage ratio covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents both as defined by the credit agreement to consolidated earningsbeforeinteresttaxesdepreciationandamortization as defined by the credit agreement “consolidated ebitda” of less than 45x through december 31 2008 and less than 40x thereafter provided that aggregated subordinated indebtedness is less than 250 million the senior leverage covenant which is only applicable provided aggregate subordinated indebtedness is greater than 250 million requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated senior indebtedness to consolidated ebitda of less than 30x the interest coverage covenant requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda to cash interest expense as defined by the credit agreement of 25x the capital expenditure covenant limits annual capital expenditures as defined by the credit agreement to 1250 million or less through december 31 2006 and 1100 million or less thereafter in the event that we do not meet these covenants we are considered to be in default on the credit facilities at which time the credit facilities may become immediately due this credit facility contains a cross default provision that would be triggered if we were to default on any other indebtedness greater than 100 million 

 

our other indebtedness does not contain provisions that would make it a default if we were to default on our credit facilities 

 

the fee we pay on borrowings on our 3250 million 7 1  2 year senior term loan fee is 225 above libor the fees we pay on our 2850 million 6 1  2 year multicurrency revolving credit facility depend on our total leverage ratio based on our current total leverage ratio our fees on borrowings are 175 above libor and are 375 on the total remaining availability on the revolving credit facility in the event our leverage ratio improves the fees on revolving credit borrowings and the unused availability decline gradually to 75 and 25 respectively at a total leverage ratio of less than or equal to 125x 

 

we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event of default upon a change in longterm debt ratings that would have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

at december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all debt covenants we expect to remain in compliance throughout 2006

during the year ended december 31 2005 our global music segment and other operations made cash payments of 83 million and 02 million respectively related to various earnouts and deferred purchase price consideration on prior year acquisitions 

capital expenditures 

 

venue operations is a capital intensive business requiring consistent investment in our existing venues in order to address audience and artist expectations technological industry advances and various federal and state regulations 

 

we categorize capital outlays into maintenance expenditures and new venue expenditures maintenance expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and to a lesser extent capital expenditures related to information systems and administrative offices new venue expenditures relate to either the construction of new venues or major renovations to existing buildings that are being added to our venue network capital expenditures typically increase during periods when venues are not in operation 

 

our capital expenditures have consisted of the following 

 

 

 

maintenance expenditures for 2005 include higher expenditures relating to capital spent to improve the audience experience at our owned and operated amphitheaters we expect this higher level of maintenance expenditures to continue in 2006 

 

of the capital expenditures above remaining in construction in progress at december 31 2005 was 399 million primarily consisting of development or renovation costs associated with three venues we will incur additional costs in 2006 related to the completion of these venues 

 

company share repurchase program 

 

during the year ended december 31 2005 our board of directors authorized a 150 million share repurchase program effective immediately the repurchase program is authorized through december 31 2006 although prior to such time the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time as of december 31 2005 we have repurchased 15 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 180 million including commissions and fees as of february 28 2006 we have repurchased an additional 19 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 247 million including commissions and fees 

 

summary 

 

our primary shortterm liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements and maintenance expenditures while our longterm liquidity needs are primarily associated with new venue expenditures our primary sources of funds for our shortterm liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility while our longterm sources of funds will be from cash from operations longterm bank borrowings and other debt or equity financing 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

 

firm commitments 

 

in addition to the scheduled maturities on our debt we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts we lease office space certain equipment and the venues used in our entertainment operations under longterm operating leases some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance we also have minimum payments associated with noncancelable contracts related to our operations such as artist guarantee contracts and theatrical production payments as part of our ongoing 

capital projects we will enter into construction related commitments for future capital expenditure work the scheduled maturities discussed below represent contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 and thus do not represent all expected expenditures for those periods 

 

the scheduled maturities of our longterm debt outstanding future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable lease agreements minimum payments under other noncancelable contracts and capital expenditures commitments as of december 31 2005 are as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

minimum rentals of 1141 million to be received in years 2006 through 2020 under noncancelable subleases are excluded from the commitment amounts in the above table 

 

cash flows 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

 

cash provided by operations was 139 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to cash provided by operations of 1199 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 1060 million decrease in cash provided by operations resulted from a decrease in net income adjusted for noncash charges related to deferred income tax expense and changes in the event related operating accounts which are 

dependent on the number and size of events ongoing at year end we had prepaid more expenses in 2005 including artist deposits and accrued more expenses based on the size and timing of the upcoming tours 

 

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

 

cash provided by operations was 1199 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to cash provided by operations of 1387 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the 188 million decrease in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from a decrease in net income 

 

investing activities 

 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

 

cash used in investing activities was 1060 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to cash used in investing activities of 841 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 219 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of 191 million and an increase in advances to nonconsolidated affiliates of 43 million these increases were partially offset by less acquisition related payments in 2005 

 

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

 

cash used in investing activities was 841 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to cash used in investing activities of 520 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the 321 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to more acquisitionrelated payments and higher advances to nonconsolidated affiliates in 2004 and the collection of a note receivable in 2003 

 

financing activities 

 

historically we had funded our cash needs through an intercompany promissory note with clear channel communications the intercompany promissory note functioned as part of a sweep account that allowed excess operating cash generated by our domestic operations to be transferred to clear channel communications generally on a daily basis as we had cash needs they were funded from clear channel communications through this account 

 

following our separation from clear channel communications we expect to fund our cash needs through cash from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash and cash equivalents 

 

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

 

cash provided by financing activities was 3454 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 233 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the 3221 million increase in cash provided by financing activities is a result of proceeds received from our term loan and issuance of redeemable preferred stock offset by repurchases of our common stock 

 

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

 

cash provided by financing activities was 233 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to cash used in financing activities of 569 million for the year ended december 31 2003 the 802 million increase in cash provided by financing activities is a result of more cash being provided by clear channel communications for 2004 primarily due to higher cash used in investing activities in 2004 from more acquisition payments this is also due to more cash generated from operations in our international businesses during 2004 which does not sweep to clear channel communications as often as our domestic operations 

 

seasonality 

 

for financial statement purposes our global music segment typically experiences higher operating income in the second and third quarters as our outdoor venues and international festivals are primarily used in or 

occur during may through september in addition the timing of tours of top grossing acts can impact comparability of quarterly results year over year although annual results may not be impacted our global theater segment typically experiences its higher operating income during the first second and fourth quarters of the calendar year as the theatrical touring season typically runs from september through april 

 

cash flows from global music and global theater typically have a slightly different seasonality as advance payments are often made for artist performance fees and theatrical production costs in advance of the date the related event tickets go on sale these artist fees and production costs are expensed when the event occurs once tickets for an event go on sale we begin to receive payments from ticket sales still in advance of when the event occurs we record these ticket sales as revenue when the event occurs 

 

we expect these trends to continue in the future see item 1a risk factors — our operations are seasonal and our results of operations vary from quarter to quarter so our financial performance in certain financial quarters may not be indicative of or comparable to our financial performance in subsequent financial quarters 

 

market risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

we have operations in countries throughout the world the financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies as a result our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations our foreign operations reported operating income of 606 million for the year ended december 31 2005 currently we do not operate in any hyperinflationary countries we estimate that a 10 change in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the year ended december 31 2005 by 61 million as of december 31 2005 our primary foreign exchange exposure included the euro british pound swedish kroner and canadian dollar 

 

this analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the united states or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities 

 

occasionally we will use forward currency contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with artist fee commitments at december 31 2005 we do not have any outstanding forward currency contracts 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates we had 3668 million total debt outstanding as of december 31 2005 of which 3251 million was variable rate debt 

 

based on the amount of our floatingrate debt as of december 31 2005 each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 08 million this potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floatingrate debt remains constant with an immediate acrosstheboard increase or decrease as of december 31 2005 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period 

 

beginning in 2006 we intend to use interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with our variable rate debt we do not intend to hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 153 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29 “statement 153” statement 153 eliminates the apb opinion no 29 exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance statement 153 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after the date of issuance the provisions of statement 153 should be applied prospectively we intend to adopt statement 153 for our fiscal year beginning january 1 2006 and we do not believe that adoption will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

 

on december 16 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “statement 123r” which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation “statement 123” statement 123r supersedes accounting principles board “apb” opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees “apb 25” and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 95 statement of cash flows generally the approach in statement 123r is similar to the approach described in statement 123 however statement 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative statement 123r is effective for financial statements for the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2005 early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued in april 2005 the sec issued a press release announcing that it would provide for phasedin implementation guidance for statement 123r the sec would require that registrants that are not small business issuers adopt statement 123r’s fair value method of accounting for sharebased payments to employees no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 we intend to adopt statement 123r on january 1 2006 using the modified prospective method 

 

as permitted by statement 123 we currently account for sharebased payments to employees using apb 25 intrinsic value method and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options accordingly the adoption of statement 123r’s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations although it will have no impact on our overall financial position we are unable to quantify the impact of adoption of statement 123r at this time because it will depend on levels of sharebased payments granted in the future however had we adopted statement 123r in prior periods the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note a of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein statement 123ralso requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow this requirement will increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on among other things the levels of sharebased payments granted in the future 

 

in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 sharebased payment “sab 107” sab 107 expresses the sec staff’s views regarding the interaction between statement 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff’s views regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements for public companies in particular sab 107 provides guidance related to sharebased payment transactions with nonemployees the transition from nonpublic to public entity status valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under sharebased payment arrangements the classification of compensation expense nongaap financial measures first time adoption of statement 123r in an interim period capitalization of compensation cost related to sharebased payment arrangements the accounting for income tax effects of sharebased payment arrangements upon adoption of statement 123rand the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of statement 123r 

 

in may 2005 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 154 accounting changes and error corrections “statement 154” statement 154 replaces apb opinion no 20 accounting 

changes  and fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle statement 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions those provisions should be followed statement 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we will adopt statement 154 on january 1 2006 and do not anticipate adoption to materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

 

in june 2005 the emerging issues task force “eitf” issued eitf 056 determining the amortization period of leasehold improvements “eitf 056” eitf 056 requires that assets recognized under capital leases generally be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee’s normal depreciation policy except that the amortization period is limited to the lease term which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured eitf 056 also addresses the determination of the amortization period for leasehold improvements that are purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease should be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term that includes reasonably assured lease renewals as determined on the date of the acquisition of the leasehold improvement we adopted eitf 056 on july 1 2005 which did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

 

in october 2005 the fasb issued staff position 131 “fsp 131” fsp 131 requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense the guidance in fsp 131 shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after december 15 2005 we will adopt fsp 131 on january 1 2006 and do not anticipate adoption to materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

 

in february 2006 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fas 123r — 4 contingent cash settlement “fsp fas 123r — 4” fsp fas 123r — 4 requires companies to classify employee stock options and similar instruments with contingent cash settlement features as equity awards under statement 123rprovided that 1 the contingent event that permits or requires cash settlement is not considered probable of occurring and is not within the control of the employee and 2 the award includes no other features that would require liability classification we will adopt fsp fas 123r — 4 on january 1 2006 and do not anticipate adoption to materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such difference could be material our significant accounting policies are discussed in note a summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors generally we record specific reserves to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected when a customer’s account ages beyond typical collection patterns or we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to a lesser extent we recognize reserves based on historical experience of bad debts as a percentage of revenues for applicable businesses adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings 

 

if our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a 10 change in our allowance it is estimated that our bad debt expense for the year ended december 31 2005 would have changed by 10 million and our net income for the same period would have changed by 10 million 

 

longlived assets 

 

longlived assets such as property plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable longlived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair market value 

 

we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets including future expected cash flows and discount rates as well as future salvage values our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

 

if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations we review goodwill for potential impairment annually using the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 

 

the income approach we use for valuing goodwill involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets discounted to their present value using a riskadjusted discount rate terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present value 

 

as a result of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january 1 2002 we recorded a noncash net of tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately 39 billion as required by statement 142 a subsequent impairment test was performed at october 1 2002 which resulted in no additional impairment charge the noncash impairment of our goodwill was generally caused by unfavorable economic conditions which persisted throughout 2001 these conditions adversely impacted the cash flow projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit at january 1 2002 which resulted in the noncash impairment charge of a portion of our goodwill we may incur impairment charges in future periods under statement 142 to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates and to the extent that market values decrease and longterm interest rates increase 

 

revenue recognition 

 

revenue from the presentation and production of an event is recognized on the date of the performance revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred income until the event occurs revenue 

collected from sponsorships and other revenue which is not related to any single event is classified as deferred income and generally amortized over the operating season or the term of the contract 

 

we believe that the credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and the geographic diversification of our customers 

 

barter transactions 

 

barter transactions represent the exchange of display space or tickets for advertising merchandise or services these transactions are generally recorded at the lower of the fair market value of the display space or tickets relinquished or the fair value of the advertising merchandise or services received revenue is recognized on barter and trade transactions when the advertisements are displayed or the event occurs for which the tickets are exchanged expenses are recorded when the advertising merchandise or service is received or when the event occurs barter and trade revenues for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were approximately 349 million 451 million and 334 million respectively and are included in total revenues barter and trade expenses for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 were approximately 348 million 445 million and 327 million respectively and are included in divisional operating expenses these transactions relate to each of our segments and generally occur relatively evenly throughout the year 

 

litigation accruals 

 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and as required have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims management’s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies it is possible however that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 

 

income taxes 

 

we account for income taxes using the liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized as all earnings from our foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed our income tax provision does not include additional united states taxes on foreign operations it is not practical to determine the amount of federal income taxes if any that might become due in the event that the earnings were distributed 

 

our provision for income taxes has been computed on the basis that we file separate consolidated income tax returns with our subsidiaries prior to the separation our operations were included in a consolidated federal income tax return filed by clear channel communications certain tax liabilities owed by us were remitted to the appropriate taxing authority by clear channel communications and were accounted for as noncash capital contributions by clear channel communications to us tax benefits recognized on employee stock option exercises were retained by clear channel communications subsequent to the separation we will file separate consolidated income tax returns 

 

we compute our deferred income tax provision using the liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes our provision for income taxes is further disclosed in note i — income taxes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

inflation 

 

inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs such as employee compensation and equipment although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable we believe we have reduced the impact of these higher costs by increasing ticket prices where possible and reducing other costs 

 

ratio of earnings to fixed charges 

 

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows 

 

 

 

 

  

the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges fixed charges represent interest amortization of debt discount and expense and the estimated interest portion of rental charges

introduction 

 

live nation became subject to the periodic and other reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended on december 21 2005 the date of our separation from clear channel communications 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

live nation the “company” has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the company including its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify the company’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the board of directors it should be noted that because of inherent limitations our disclosure controls and procedures however well designed and operated can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met 

 

based on their evaluation as of december 31 2005 the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
