our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos include comprehensive managed care benefits generally through a participating network of physicians hospitals and other providers preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose any health care provider however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy solutions provider and home solutions as well as services and capabilities to advance population health at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2021 



medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage or ma plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo private feeforservice or pffs and special needs plans including dual eligible special needs or dsnp plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of 

medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2021 75 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms will complete the phasedin transition from raps to eds by using only eds data to calculate risk scores in 2022 for more information refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and item 1a  risk factors 

at december 31 2021 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 4409100 individual medicare advantage members including approximately 769100 members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 119 billion which represented approximately 20 of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 15 of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 

our individual medicare advantage products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms 

relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2022 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2022 have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp offering cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data titled “medicare part d” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2022 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2022 have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

group medicare advantage and medicare standalone pdp 

we offer products that enable employers that provide postretirement health care benefits to replace medicare wrap or medicare supplement products with medicare advantage or standalone pdps from humana these products are primarily offered as ppo plans on the same medicare platform as individual medicare advantage plans these plans offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual medicare plans discussed previously however group medicare advantage plans typically have richer benefit offerings than individual medicare advantage plans including prescription drug coverage in the gap for instance due to the desire of many customers to closely match their preretirement benefit structure 

medicare supplement 

we also offer medicare supplement products that helps pay the medical expenses that medicare ffs does not cover such as copayments coinsurance and deductibles 

statebased medicaid contracts 

through our statebased contracts we serve members enrolled in medicaid a program funded by both the federal and state governments and administered by states to care for their most vulnerable populations within federal guidelines states determine whom to cover but general categories for traditional medicaid programs include children and parents receiving assistance through temporary assistance to needy families tanf aged blind and disabled abd individuals and medicaid expansion adults through medicaid managed longterm support services mltss programs states offer programs to deliver support services to people who receive home and community or institutionbased services for longterm care 

we have contracts in multiple states to serve medicaideligible members including florida kentucky ohio south carolina and wisconsin 

we also serve members who qualify for both medicaid and medicare referred to as dual eligible through our medicaid medicare advantage and standalone prescription drug plans as the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of costs humana is participating in varied integration models designed to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable costs these programs largely operate separately from traditional medicaid programs we currently serve dual eligible members under cms’s dual eligible demonstration program in illinois 

as part of our individual medicare advantage products we also offer dualeligible special needs plans dsnp in connection with offering a dsnp in a particular state we are required to enter into a special coordinating contract with the applicable state medicaid agency to meet federal requirements that took effect in 2021 states have begun to implement new dsnp requirements to strengthen medicaidmedicare integration requirements for dsnps some states are also moving to support the dual eligible population by linking dsnp participation to enrollment in a plan that also participates in a statebased medicaid program to coordinate and integrate both medicare and medicaid benefits

membership 

the following table summarizes total medical membership in our retail and group and specialty segments at december 31 2021 by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate for diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2021 approximately 1654000 members or 97 of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts which provide all member benefits including 1427100 individual medicare advantage members or 324 of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and measure the financial performance of our capitated providers and require guarantees in certain instances however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 247200 hmo members including 241700 individual medicare advantage members or 169 of the 1427100 individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2021 with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 24 billion or 35 of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2021 we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information set or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every three years unless otherwise required by state or federal regulations recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we maintain accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc andor utilization review accreditation commission urac certain commercial businesses such as those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement population health management credentialing utilization management network management and member experience we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in many of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos and ppo markets and our wellness program go365 humana’s pharmacy organization is accredited by urac 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2021 we employed approximately 1300 sales representatives as well as approximately 1500 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare products including medicare advantage 

and pdp in our retail segment and specialty products in our group and specialty segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we have a marketing arrangement with walmart stores inc or walmart for our individual medicare standalone pdp offering we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers in addition we market our medicare and individual specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our group and specialty segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we use licensed independent brokers independent agents digital insurance agencies and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our specialty products 

underwriting 

since 2014 the patient protection and affordability care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law requires certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our individual medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have a larger membership base andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2021 form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system including the health care reform law at the federal level and laws in certain states limiting the entry of new providers or services though a certificate of need or con process 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends accordingly our reserves may be insufficient 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members including claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members and various other costs generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

• increased use of medical facilities and services and the increased cost of such services 

• increased use or cost of prescription drugs including specialty prescription drugs 

• the introduction of new or costly treatments prescription drugs or new technologies 

• our membership mix 

• variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products benefits or lines of business product changes or benefit level changes 

• changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market 

• changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals 

• changes in our purchase discounts or pharmacy volume rebates received from drug manufacturers and wholesalers which are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts 

• catastrophes including acts of terrorism public health emergencies epidemics or pandemics such as the spread of covid19 or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes which could occur more frequently or with more intense effects as a result of the impact of global climate change 

• medical cost inflation and 

• government mandated benefits member eligibility criteria or other legislative judicial or regulatory changes 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part 

on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses any costs associated with exiting products additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors through the medicare annual enrollment period in addition contracts for the sale of group commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical and administrative costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare advantage and prescription drug plans military and medicaid programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as changes to the programs in which we participate those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives and our statebased contracts strategy our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products in addition there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery 

model and our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy and the attendant concentration of revenues intensifies the risks to us inherent in medicare products any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

the achievement of star ratings of 4star or higher qualifies medicare advantage plans for premium bonuses our medicare advantage plans operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings despite our operational efforts to improve our star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically maintain existing or implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems these systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop and integrate new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences and even with such resources there is no assurance that we will be able to do so if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to improve service levels or maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing customer and health care provider disputes regulatory or other legal problems difficulty preventing and detecting fraud have increases in operating expenses loss of existing customers difficulty in attracting new customers or other adverse consequences each of which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers and service providers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows the misappropriation of our proprietary information andor thirdparty infringement claims against any software products we use could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we and the third party service providers on whom we rely are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintentional dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or 

penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data and rely on third party service providers to do the same including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty we have been and will likely continue to be regular targets of attempted cybersecurity attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of our information technology security systems although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or results of operations financial position or cash flow through december 31 2021 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such cybersecurity attacks or other information security risks or threats in the future a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems or the security of third party service providers could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders 

the costs to detect prevent eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures or the security measures of third party service providers and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our associates or members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment compensation and other labor and employment practice suits employee benefit claims stockholder suits and other securities laws claims intellectual and other property claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims claims relating to our administration of our medicare part d offerings medical malpractice actions brought against our employed providers or affiliated physicianowned professional groups based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for a thirdparty providers alleged malpractice claims arising from any adverse medical consequences resulting from our recommendations about the appropriateness of providers’ proposed medical treatment plans for patients allegations of anticompetitive and unfair business activities provider disputes over compensation or nonacceptance or termination of provider contracts disputes related to aso business including actions alleging claim administration errors false claims litigation such as qui tam lawsuits brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government alleging that we as a government contractor submitted false claims to the government or retained overpayments from the government among other allegations resulting from coding and review practices under the medicare riskadjustment model claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices claims relating to customer audits and contract performance claims relating to dispensing of drugs 

associated with our inhouse dispensing pharmacies and professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public 

in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 89 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

• at december 31 2021 under our contracts with cms we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 769100 individual medicare advantage members in florida these contracts accounted for approximately 15 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 the loss of these and other cms contracts which are generally renewed annually or significant changes in the medicare advantage and prescription drug plan programs as a result of legislative or regulatory action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• at december 31 2021 our military services business which accounted for approximately 1 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 primarily consisted of the tricare t2017 east region contract the t2017 east region contract is a consolidation of the former t3 north and south regions comprising 32 states and approximately six million tricare beneficiaries under which delivery of health care services commenced on january 1 2018 the t2017 east region contract is a 5 year contract set to expire on december 31 2022 unless extended and is subject to renewals on january 1 of each year during its term at the governments option the loss of the tricare t2017 east region contract may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• there is a possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs including medicare and medicaid if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false 

claims act as a government contractor we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government alleging that the government contractor submitted false claims to the government litigation of this nature is filed under seal to allow the government an opportunity to investigate and to decide if it wishes to intervene and assume control of the litigation if the government does not intervene the lawsuit is unsealed and the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own 

• cms uses a riskadjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health status of covered members the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more where a plans membership has higher expected costs under this model rates paid to ma plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard medicarecovered benefits to an enrollee with a national average risk profile that baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government feeforservice program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims in addition we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model these compliance efforts include the internal contract level audits described in more detail below as well as ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes 

cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2021 75 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms will complete the phasedin transition from raps to eds by using only eds data to calculate risk scores in 2022 the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

cms and the office of the inspector general of health and human services or hhsoig are continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans 

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provided that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the radv audit sample would be extrapolated to the entire ma contract after a comparison of the audit results to a similar audit of the government’s traditional feeforservice medicare program or medicare ffs we refer to the process of accounting for errors in ffs claims as the ffs adjuster this comparison of radv audit results to the ffs error rate is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of radv audit results because the government used the medicare ffs program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set to 

estimate the costs of various health status conditions and to set the resulting adjustments to ma plans’ payment rates in order to establish actuarial equivalence in payment rates as required under the medicare statute cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the medicare ffs program dataset 

the final radv extrapolation methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to cms radv contract level audits conducted for contract year 2011 and subsequent years cms is currently conducting radv contract level audits for certain of our medicare advantage plans 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feefor service business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been finalized we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows we report the results of these internal contract level audits to cms including identified overpayments if any 

on october 26 2018 cms issued a proposed rule and accompanying materials which we refer to as the “proposed rule” related to among other things the radv audit methodology described above if implemented the proposed rule would use extrapolation in radv audits applicable to payment year 2011 contractlevel audits and all subsequent audits without the application of a ffs adjuster to audit findings we believe that the proposed rule fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and have provided substantive comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process whether and to what extent cms finalizes the proposed rule and any related regulatory industry or company reactions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition as part of our internal compliance efforts we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to among other things our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the risk adjustment model these reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to cms that may either individually or in the aggregate be material as such the result of these reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

• our cms contracts which cover members’ prescription drugs under medicare part d contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk these provisions certain of which are described below affect our ultimate payments from cms 

the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated 

with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net receivable of 106 million at december 31 2021 and net receivable of 95 million at december 31 2020 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms further legislative or regulatory changes to how actual prescription drug costs are reported or calculated may lower reinsurance or lowincome cost subsidies paid by cms and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

• we are also subject to various other governmental audits and investigations under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance our hmos are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health audits and investigations including audits of risk adjustment data are also conducted by state attorneys general cms hhsoig the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor and the defense contract audit agency all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs including a limitation on our ability to market or sell products the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or changes in our business practices the outcome of any current or future governmental or internal investigations cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities nevertheless it is reasonably possible that any such outcome of litigation penalties fines or other sanctions could be substantial and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows certain of these matters could also affect our reputation in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or legislative judicial or regulatory changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 

the health care reform law and other current or future legislative judicial or regulatory changes 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the 

us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance industry fee which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate was in effect for calendar year 2020 and permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021 

it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as other current or future legislative including the families first coronavirus response act the “families first act” the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to covid19 judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or restrictions on profitability including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage business profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses or changes to the part d prescription drug benefit design may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

additionally potential legislative changes or judicial determinations including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law or declare all or certain portions of the health care reform law unconstitutional create uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes or judicial determinations may occur 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for the confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information including requirements that insurers provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened and strengthened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other requirements the hitech act and hipaa requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to hhs in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

we are subject to various federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws including the federal false claims act the “false claims act” the federal antikickback statute the “antikickback statute” the federal “stark law” and related state laws potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties treble damages and exclusion from participating in the medicare and medicaid programs or other government healthcare programs the false claims act prohibits knowingly submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs the antikickback statute prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of business under medicare or other governmental health program the stark law prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship unless the financial relationship fits within a permissible exception 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of our products and services 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including capital adequacy and other licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

certain of our healthcare services businesses require a certificate of need or con to operate in certain states these states restrict the entry of new providers or services and the expansion of existing providers or services in their state through a con process which is periodically evaluated and updated as required by applicable state law to the extent that we require a con or other similar approvals to expand our operations our expansion could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain the necessary approval to the extent laws in these con states change including the elimination of the con requirement the intangible value associated with these cons may be impaired 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our transactions may cause asset writeoffs restructuring costs or other expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives and we may divest or wind down such businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us and the divestiture of certain businesses could result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which 

aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the success of our healthcare services businesses depends on our ability and the ability of our affiliated physicianowned professional groups and management services organizations to recruit hire acquire contract with and retain physicians nurses and other medical professionals who are experienced in providing care services to older adults the market to acquire or manage physician practices and to employ or contract with individual physicians nurses and other medical professionals is and is expected to remain highly competitive and the performance of our healthcare services businesses may be adversely impacted if we and our affiliated physicianowned professional groups and management services organizations are unable to attract maintain satisfactory relationships with and retain physicians nurses and other medical professionals or if these businesses are unable to retain patients following the departure of a physician nurses or other medical professional in addition our healthcare services businesses contract with competitors of our health benefits businesses and these businesses could suffer if they are unable to maintain relationships with these companies or fail to adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees further managing succession for and retention of key executives is critical to our success and our failure to do so could adversely affect our businesses operating results andor future performance 

our success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain qualified employees and executives including those with diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets to operate and expand our business we face intense competition for qualified employees and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that such competition among potential employers will not result in increasing salaries in addition while we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives these plans do not guarantee the services of our key employees and executives will continue to be available to us if we are unable to attract develop retain and effectively manage the development and succession plans for key employees and executives our business results of operations and future performance could be adversely affected 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subject us to regulations and distribution and supply chain risks in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our inhouse dispensing pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies 

our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver 

pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the us department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products including the application of state laws and regulations related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies violations of which could expose us to civil and criminal penalties and manufacturing distribution or other supply chain disruptions including disruptions that occur as a result of catastrophes including acts of terrorism public health emergencies epidemics or pandemics such as the spread of covid19 or natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes which could occur more frequently or with more intense effects as a result of the impacts of global climate change each of which could impact the availability or cost of supplying of such products 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our inhouse dispensing pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment 

are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

we believe that certain of our customers place importance on our claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain future borrowings and investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

ongoing volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential credit related impairments are considered using a variety of factors including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or credit related impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment including the heightened uncertainty created by the covid19 pandemic we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

the spread of and response to covid19 underscores certain risks we face including those discussed above and the ongoing heightened uncertainty created by the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact to us of covid19 

covid19 underscores certain risks we face including those discussed above as the covid19 pandemic continues the premiums we charge may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members each of which could be impacted by many factors including the impacts that we have experienced and may continue to experience to our revenues due to limitations on our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members and appropriately document their risk profiles as a result of our members being unable or unwilling to see their providers due to actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid19 increased costs that may result from higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs and shifts in our premium and medical claims cost trends to reflect the demographic impact of higher mortality during the covid19 pandemic in addition we are offering and have been mandated by legislative and regulatory action including the families first act and cares act to provide certain expanded benefit coverage to our members such as waiving or reimbursing certain costs for covid19 testing vaccinations and treatment these measures taken by us or governmental action to respond to the ongoing impact of covid19 including further expansion or modification of the services delivered to our members the adoption or modification of regulatory requirements associated with those services and the costs and challenges associated with ensuring timely compliance with such requirements and the potential for widespread testing treatments and the distribution and administration of covid19 vaccines could adversely impact our profitability 

the spread and impact of covid19 and additional variants or actions taken to mitigate this spread could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate effectively including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages disruptions in public and private infrastructure including communications availability of inperson sales and marketing channels financial services and supply chains could materially and adversely disrupt our normal business operations a significant subset of our and our third party providers’ employee populations are in a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 which may exacerbate certain risks to our business including an increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal or proprietary andor confidential information the continued covid19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity including the businesses of some of our commercial customers and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in the financial markets in addition to disrupting our operations these developments may adversely affect the timing of commercial customer premium collections and corresponding claim payments the value of our investment portfolio or future liquidity needs 

the ongoing heightened uncertainty created by the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact to us of covid19 we are continuing to monitor the spread of covid19 changes to our benefit coverages and the ongoing costs and business impacts of dealing with covid19 including the potential costs and impacts associated with lifting or reimposing restrictions on movement and economic activity the timing and degree in resumption of demand for deferred healthcare services the pace of administration of covid19 vaccines and the effectiveness of those vaccines and related risks the magnitude and duration of the pandemic remains uncertain and its ultimate impact on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows could be material

executive overview 

general 

humana inc headquartered in louisville kentucky is a leading health and wellbeing company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well‐being and lower costs our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with medicare families individuals military service personnel and communities at large to accomplish that we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients our members our range of clinical capabilities resources and tools such as in‐home care behavioral health pharmacy services data analytics and wellness solutions combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective 

the health benefits industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

kindred at home acquisition 

on august 17 2021 we acquired the remaining 60 interest in kindred at home or kah the nation’s largest home health and hospice provider from tpg capital and welsh carson anderson  stowe two private equity funds for an enterprise value of 82 billion which includes our equity value of 24 billion associated with our 40 minority ownership interest the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held 40 equity method investment with a carrying value of approximately 13 billion resulted in a 11 billion gain recognized in other income expense net kah has locations in 40 states providing extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65 overlap with our individual medicare advantage membership we paid the approximate 58 billion transaction price net of our existing equity stake through a combination of debt financing the assumption of existing kah indebtedness and parent company cash 

covid19 

the emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus or covid19 beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has impacted our business during periods of increased incidences of covid19 nonessential care from a reduction in noncovid19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system consumption decreased utilization at the same time covid19 treatment and testing costs increased utilization the significant disruption in utilization during 2020 also impacted our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members and appropriately document their risk profiles and as such significantly affected our 2021 revenue under the risk adjustment payment model for medicare advantage plans finally changes in utilization patterns and actions taken in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time and shifting the timing of claim payments and provider capitation surplus payments impacted our claim reserve development and operating cash flows for 2020 and 2021 

business segments 

we manage our business with three reportable segments retail group and specialty and healthcare services the reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information 

the retail segment consists of medicare benefits marketed to individuals or directly via group medicare accounts in addition the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible demonstration and longterm support services benefits which we refer to collectively as our statebased contracts the group and specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups including dental vision and other supplemental health benefits as well as administrative services only or aso products in addition our group and specialty segment includes our military services business primarily our tricare t2017 east region contract the healthcare services segment includes pharmacy provider and home services along with other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health the operations of the recently acquired full ownership of kindred at home as well as the companys strategic partnership with welsh carson anderson  stowe wcas to develop and operate seniorfocused payoragnostic primary care centers are also included in the healthcare services segment 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from equity method investments or segment earnings transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and home services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often use the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at a corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations 

seasonality 

covid19 disrupted the pattern of our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows largely due to the temporary deferral of nonessential care which resulted in reductions in noncovid19 hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system utilization during higher levels of covid19 hospital admissions at the same time during periods of increased incidences of covid19 covid19 treatment and testing costs increase similar impacts and seasonal disruptions from either higher or lower utilization are expected to persist as we respond to and recover from the covid19 global health crisis 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of low income senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare marketing season 

our group and specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the group and specialty segment’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses

• our strategy offers our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets at the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience we believe this strategy is positioning us for longterm growth in both membership and earnings we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships at december 31 2021 approximately 3009600 members or 68 of our individual medicare advantage members were in valuebased relationships under our integrated care delivery model as compared to 2650100 members or 67 at december 31 2020 

• in order to create capacity to fund growth and investment in our medicare advantage business and further expand our healthcare services capability in 2023 we committed to efforts to create additional value through cost savings productivity initiatives and value acceleration from previous investments as a result of these initiatives we anticipate that we may incur certain charges in 2022 

• on february 2 2022 centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms issued its preliminary 2023 medicare advantage and part d payment rates and proposed policy changes collectively the advance notice cms has invited public comment on the advance notice before publishing final rate on or before april 4 2022 or the final notice in the advance notice cms estimates medicare advantage plans across the sector will on average experience a 448 increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein as indicated by cms its estimate excludes the impact of feeforservice county rebasingrepricing since the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data which will be available with the publication of the final notice further the benchmark increase excludes ma risk score trend as individual plans’ experience will vary based on the company’s preliminary analysis using the same factors cms included in its estimate the components of which are detailed on cms’s website we anticipate the proposals in the advance notice would result in a change generally in line with cms’s estimate the company will be drawing upon its program expertise to provide cms formal commentary on the impact of the advance notice and the related impact on medicare beneficiaries’ quality of care and service to its members through the medicare advantage program 

• net income was 29 billion or 2267 per diluted common share and 34 billion or 2531 per diluted common share in 2021 and 2020 respectively this comparison was significantly impacted by the gain on our equity method investment in kindred at home upon completion of our acquisition of the business putcall valuation adjustments associated with our non consolidating minority interest investments the change in the fair value of publiclytraded equity securities transaction and integration costs associated with the kindred at home acquisition and the receipt of unpaid risk corridor payments in the third quarter of 2020 that were previously written off the putcall valuation adjustments included the impact of the termination of the putcall agreement related to kindred at home as a result of the signing of the definitive agreement for the transaction on april 27 2021 the impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for 2021 



◦ excluding these adjustments comparisons of our results of operations were materially impacted by the significant temporary deferral of care in 2020 resulting from stayathome orders physical distancing measures and other restrictions implemented to reduce the spread of covid19 as well as the impact of covid19 testing and treatment costs which on a net basis significantly and favorably impacted the 2020 period results when compared to the 2021 period results in addition the 2021 period results reflect the impact of lower covid19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020 administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment member response effort the buildout of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely and charitable contribution cost to support the communities served by us combined the covid19 impacts described previously resulted in lower operating results in 2021 compared to 2020 

◦ partially offsetting the covid19 financial headwind that we experienced in 2021 our results of operations for 2021 were favorably impacted by individual medicare advantage and statebased contract membership growth and improved operating performance in our healthcare services segment including the consolidation of kindred at home operations upon completion of the acquisition of the remaining 60 interest in kindred at home in august 2021 further 2021 was also favorably impacted by the lower tax rate resulting from the termination of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2021 as well as a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per common share primarily reflecting share repurchases 

health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance 

industry fee which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate was in effect for calendar year 2020 and permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021 

it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as other current or future legislative judicial or regulatory changes such as the families first coronavirus response act the families first act the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to covid19 including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or restrictions on profitability including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and home services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers and are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data in this 2021 form 10k 

comparison of results of operations for 2021 and 2020 

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

consolidated 



a represents total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue 

b represents total operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues less investment income 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased 56 billion or 76 from 742 billion in the 2020 period to 798 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher premium revenues from medicare advantage and statebased contracts membership growth higher per member medicare advantage premiums as a result of the improving cms benchmark rate for 2021 net of medicare risk adjustment mra headwinds resulting from covid19 related utilization disruption in 2020 as well as the additional quarter impact of medicare sequestration relief in 2021 that was not enacted until the second quarter of 2020 these increases were partially offset by declining standalone pdp group commercial medical and group medicare advantage membership as more fully described in the detailed segment results discussion that follows as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased 12 billion or 683 from 18 billion in the 2020 period to 31 billion in the 2021 period primarily due to higher home solutions revenues associated with consolidation of kindred at home earnings 

investment income 

investment income decreased 967 million or 838 from 12 billion in the 2020 period to 187 million in the 2021 period p rimarily due to a significant decrease in the fair value of our publiclytraded equity securities investments 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense increased 76 billion or 123 from 616 billion in the 2020 period to 692 billion in the 2021 period the consolidated benefit ratio increased 360 basis points from 831 in the 2020 period to 867 in the 2021 period these increases reflect the termination in 2021 of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee which along with a portion of the related tax benefit was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products and covid19 impacts including the impact of the deferral of nonessential care net of meaningful covid19 treatment and testing costs our pandemic relief efforts in 2020 as well as 2021 mra headwinds resulting from this covid19 related utilization disruption in 2020 the year over year increase further reflects the 2020 impact of the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off and the 2021 impact a ssociated with the competitive nature of the group medicare advantage business particularly in large group accounts that were recently procured as well as in the standalone pdp business these factors were partially offset by higher favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development in 2021 

the higher favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development was primarily attributable to the reversal of actions taken in 2020 including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time impacting our claim payment patterns the suspension during 2020 was intended to provide financial and administrative relief for providers facing unprecedented strain as a result of the covid19 pandemic the favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 100 basis points in the 2021 period versus approximately 40 basis points in the 2020 period 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased 007 billion or 07 from 1005 billion in the 2020 period to 1012 billion in the 2021 period the consolidated operating cost ratio decreased 100 basis points from 132 in the 2020 period to 122 in the 2021 period the ratio decrease was primarily due to the termination of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2021 as well as lower covid19 related administrative costs in 2021 compared to 2020 administrative costs in 2020 included costs associated with personal protective equipment member response efforts and the buildout of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely the decrease was 

further impacted by scale efficiencies associated with growth in our individual medicare advantage membership operating cost efficiencies in 2021 from previously implemented productivity initiatives as well as the impact of a 200 million contribution to the humana foundation in the first half of 2020 to support communities served by the company particularly those with social and health disparities these factors were partially offset by the consolidation of kindred at home operations as the business has a significantly higher operating cost ratio than our historical consolidated operating cost ratio continued strategic and technology modernization investments made to position us for longterm success transaction and integration costs associated with the kindred at home transaction as well as the 2020 impact of the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables that were previously written off the nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 160 basis points in the 2020 period 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased 107 million or 219 from 489 million in the 2020 period to 596 million in the 2021 period primarily due to capital expenditures 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 43 million or 152 from 283 million in the 2020 period to 326 million in the 2021 period from borrowings to fund the kah acquisition 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2021 was 142 compared to the effective tax rate of 280 in 2020 the change was primarily due to the nontaxable gain we recognized on our previously held kindred at home equity method investment from our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in the business in august 2021 and the termination of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2021 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable benefits payable and other receivables and payables our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk the use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators

cash and cash equivalents decreased to 34 billion at december 31 2021 from 47 billion at december 31 2020 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

cash flows provided by operations of 23 billion in the 2021 period decreased 34 billion from cash flows provided by operations of 56 billion in the 2020 period primarily due to the negative impact of working capital items and lower earnings in the 2021 period compared to the 2020 period our 2021 period operating cash flows were significantly impacted by changes to working capital levels primarily as a result of prior year disruptions caused by covid19 these impacts include paying down claims inventory and capitation for provider surplus amounts earned in 2020 as well as additional provider support 

the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



1 ibnr represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date and includes unprocessed claim inventories the level of ibnr is primarily impacted by membership levels medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received and processed ie a shorter time span results in a lower ibnr 

2 reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to biweekly payments and the monthend cutoff 

3 other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements 

the increase in benefits payable in 2021 was primarily due to higher ibnr and an increase in reported claims in process partially offset by a reduction in capitation accruals ibnr increased primarily as a result of individual medicare advantage membership growth partially offset by paying down claim inventories higher reported claims in process was a function of timing of monthend cutoff the 2020 period was significantly impacted by higher capitation accruals as significantly lower utilization caused by covid19 resulted in higher surplus accruals to providers these higher surplus accrual to providers were paid down during 2021 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



the changes in medicare receivables for both the 2021 period and the 2020 period reflect individual medicare advantage membership growth and the typical pattern caused by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model the increase in commercial and other receivables in 2021 primarily relates to the kindred at home acquisition 

cash flow from investing activities 

during 2021 we acquired kindred at home and other primary care businesses for cash consideration of approximately 42 billion net of cash received 

during 2020 we acquired enclara healthcare a hospice pharmacy and benefit provider for cash consideration of approximately 709 million net of cash received 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 13 billion 964 million and 736 million in the 2021 2020 and 2019 periods respectively 

net purchases of investment securities were 11 billion 14 billion 542 million in the 2021 2020 and 2019 periods respectively 

cash flow from financing activities 

our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year claim payments were higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk by 261 million 938 million and 560 million in the 2021 2020 and 2019 periods respectively our net receivable from cms for subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was 14 billion at december 31 2021 compared to a net receivable of 12 billion at december 31 2020 

under our administrative services only tricare contract health care costs payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by 45 million 1 million and 63 million in the 2021 2020 and 2019 periods respectively 

in august 2021 we issued 15 billion of 0650 unsecured senior notes due august 3 2023 750 million of 1350 unsecured senior notes due february 3 2027 and 750 million of 2150 unsecured senior notes due february 3 2032 our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discounts and commissions paid were 2984 million 

as of the closing of the acquisition of kindred at home in august 2021 we assumed approximately 21 billion of borrowings and subsequently repaid 150 million of borrowings in october 2021 we entered into a 20 billion term loan agreement and applied the proceeds to finance the repayment in full of the outstanding assumed kindred at home debt 

in may 2021 we entered into a 500 million unsecured delayed draw term loan credit agreement in august 2021 we borrowed 500 million under the delayed draw term loan agreement which was used in combination with other debt financing to fund the approximate 58 billion transaction price of kindred at home

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill indefinitelived and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards for further discussion of our reserving methodology including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2021 data 



a reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31 2021 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months 

b reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31 2021 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months 

c the factor change indicated represents the percentage point change 

the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for retail and group and specialty segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31 2021 net of reinsurance as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



a the factor change indicated represents the percentage point change 

as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 825 million in 2021 313 million in 2020 and 336 million in 2019 the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2021 2020 and 2019 



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2021 2020 and 2019 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions in addition the higher prior year favorable development for the year ended december 31 2021 was primarily attributable to the reversal of actions taken in 2020 including the suspension of certain financial recovery programs for a period of time impacting our claim payment patterns the suspension during 2020 was intended to provide financial and administrative relief for providers facing unprecedented strain as a result of the covid19 pandemic our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2021 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms we bill and collect premiums from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium 

premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts retroactive membership adjustments and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law we estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets as defined by the health care reform law using a methodology prescribed by hhs separately by state and legal entity medicare advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the health care reform law estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government we routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in current operations premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our 

employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2021 75 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms will complete the phasedin transition from raps to eds by using only eds data to calculate risk scores in 2022 the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model including cms changes to the submission process is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” and in item 1a  risk factors 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 140 billion or 31 of total assets at december 31 2021 and 138 billion or 39 of total assets at december 31 2020 the investment portfolio was primarily comprised of debt securities detailed below at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the fair value of investment securities were as follows at december 31 2021 and 2020 



approximately 95 of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2021 most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale taxexempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the united states as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education our general obligation bonds are diversified across the united states with no individual state exceeding 1 of our total debt securities our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2021 



prior to january 1 2020 we applied the otherthantemporary impairment model for securities in an unrealized loss position which did not result in any material impairments for 2019 beginning on january 1 2020 we adopted the new current expected credit losses or cecl model which retained many similarities from the previous otherthantemporary impairment model except eliminating from consideration in the impairment analysis the length of time over which the fair value had been less than cost also under the cecl model expected losses on available for sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities for debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost which we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if an expected credit loss has occurred in the event of an expected credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the expected credit loss is recognized in income with the remainder if any of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value 

potential expected credit loss impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a debt security changes in the quality of the debt securitys credit enhancement payment structure of the debt security changes in credit rating of the debt security by the rating agencies failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments on the debt security and changes in prepayment speeds for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements we estimate the amount of the expected credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the expected credit loss cannot exceed the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value 

the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is related to a credit event requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or expected credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods 

all issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2021 remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the debt securities were purchased at december 31 2021 we did not intend to sell any debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis additionally we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2021 or 2020 there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2019 

goodwill indefinitelived and longlived assets 

at december 31 2021 goodwill indefinitelived and other longlived assets represented 38 of total assets and 104 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 20 and 52 respectively at december 31 2020 the increase in goodwill indefinitelived and other longlived assets is primarily attributable to our august 2021 kah acquisition 

for goodwill we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

we perform a quantitative assessment to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government reimbursement rates the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin however unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions including a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reduction in our underlying cash flow assumptions including revenue growth rates medical and operating cost trends and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our home solutions and provider reporting units which accounted for 66 billion and 933 million of goodwill respectively our home solutions reporting unit includes approximately 58 billion of goodwill from our august 2021 kah acquisition impairment tests completed for 2021 2020 and 2019 did not result in an impairment loss 

indefinitelived intangible assets relate to certificate of needs con and medicare licenses acquired in connection with our august 2021 kah acquisition with a carrying value of 23 billion at december 31 2021 like goodwill we are required to test at least annually for impairment and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized fair values of indefinitelived intangible assets are determined based on the income approach impairment tests completed for 2021 did not result in an impairment loss 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense in the past we have and in the future we may enter into interest rate swap agreements depending on market conditions and other factors under the revolving credit agreements at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option the revolving credit agreements provide for the transition from libor and do not require amendment in connection with such transition there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreements at december 31 2021 or december 31 2020 

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa at december 31 2021 our net unrealized position decreased 457 million from a net unrealized gain position of 514 million at december 31 2020 to a net unrealized gain position of 57 million at december 31 2021 at december 31 2021 we had gross unrealized losses of 161 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position during 2021 and 2020 while we believe that these impairments will be recovered and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 36 years as of december 31 2021 and 30 years as of december 31 2020 based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the december 31 2021 fair value of our securities by approximately 606 million 

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the 

following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2021 and 2020 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities spread changes specific to various investment categories and the mix of shortterm versus longterm debt in the past ten years changes in 10 year us treasury rates during the year have not exceeded 300 basis points have changed between 200 and 300 basis points 0 have changed between 100 and 200 basis points 4 and have changed by less than 100 basis points 6 



a as of december 31 2021 and 2020 some of our investments had interest rates below 1 and 2 respectively so the assumed hypothetical change in pretax earnings does not reflect the full 1 and 2 respectively point reduction 

b the interest rate under our senior notes which represent 72 of total debt is fixed unaffected by changes in interest rates we had 25 billion of variable rate term loans at december 31 2021 used to fund the august 2021 kah acquisition there were no term loans at december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2021 or december 31 2020 there was 955 million and 600 million outstanding under our commercial paper program at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our interest rate under our commercial paper program was less than 1 so the assumed hypothetical change in pretax earnings does not reflect the full 1 point reduction

business segments 

we manage our business with three reportable segments retail group and specialty and healthcare services beginning january 1 2018 we exited the individual commercial fullyinsured medical health insurance business as well as certain other business in 2018 and therefore no longer report separately the individual commercial segment and the other businesses category in the current year previously the other businesses category included businesses that were not individually reportable because they did not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles primarily our closedblock of commercial longterm care insurance policies which were sold in 2018 the reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information 

  

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos include comprehensive managed care benefits generally through a participating network of physicians hospitals and other providers preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose any health care provider however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy solutions provider and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2020 



medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage or ma plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo private feeforservice or pffs and special needs plans including dual eligible special needs or dsnp plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data 

analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2020 50 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms increased that percentage to 75 for 2021 and will complete the phasedin transition from raps to eds by using only eds data to calculate risk scores in 2022 for more information refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and item 1a  risk factors 

at december 31 2020 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 3962700 individual medicare advantage members including approximately 728300 members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 109 billion which represented approximately 211 of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 144 of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 

our individual medicare advantage products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2021 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2021 have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp offering cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data titled “medicare part d” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2021 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2021 have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

group medicare advantage and medicare standalone pdp 

we offer products that enable employers that provide postretirement health care benefits to replace medicare wrap or medicare supplement products with medicare advantage or standalone pdps from humana these products are primarily offered as ppo plans on the same medicare platform as individual medicare advantage plans these plans offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual medicare plans discussed previously however group medicare advantage plans typically have richer benefit offerings than individual medicare advantage plans including prescription drug coverage in the gap for instance due to the desire of many customers to closely match their preretirement benefit structure 

medicare supplement 

we also offer medicare supplement products that helps pay the medical expenses that medicare ffs does not cover such as copayments coinsurance and deductibles 

statebased medicaid contracts 

through our statebased contracts we serve members enrolled in medicaid a program funded by both the federal and state governments and administered by states to care for their most vulnerable populations within federal guidelines states determine whom to cover but general categories for traditional medicaid programs include children and some adults receiving assistance through temporary assistance to needy families or tanf and aged blind and disabled or abd adults through the longterm support services or ltss program states offer programs to deliver support services to people who receive home and community or institutionbased services for longterm care 

we have contracts in several states to serve medicaideligible members in florida we cover the traditional programs tanf and abd members as well as provide ltss services in kentucky we serve the traditional programs originally our kentucky medicaid contract was subject to a 100 coinsurance contract with caresource management group company ceding all the risk to caresource however effective january 1 2020 we terminated the reinsurance agreement with caresource and assumed full administration and financial risk in 2021 our medicaid business significantly expanded in several states including in wisconsin with the acquisition of icare on 

january 1 2021 in oklahoma with a new contract award and in south carolina with the approval to participate in its traditional managed medicaid program 

we also serve members who qualify for both medicaid and medicare referred to as “dual eligible through our medicaid medicare advantage and standalone prescription drug plans as the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of costs humana is participating in varied integration models designed to improve health outcomes and reduce avoidable costs these programs largely operate separately from traditional medicaid and ltss programs we currently serve dual eligible members under cms’s dual eligible demonstration program in illinois and have been approved to participate in south carolina’s dual demonstration program starting in january 2022 

as part of our individual medicare advantage products we also offer dsnp plans in connection with offering a dsnp plan in a particular state we are required to enter into a special coordinating contract with the applicable state medicaid agency to meet federal requirements that took effect in 2021 states have begun to implement new dsnp requirements to strengthen medicaidmedicare integration requirements for dsnps some states are also moving to support the dual eligible population by linking dsnp participation to enrollment in a plan that also participates in a statebased medicaid program to coordinate and integrate both medicare and medicaid benefits

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2020 by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate for diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge 

for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2020 approximately 1465700 members or 87 of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts which provide all member benefits including 1231900 individual medicare advantage members or 311 of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and measure the financial performance of our capitated providers and require guarantees in certain instances however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 230400 hmo members including 224300 individual medicare advantage members or 182 of the 1231900 individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2020 with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 24 billion or 39 of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2020 we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information set or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every three years unless otherwise required by state or federal regulations recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we maintain accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc andor urac certain commercial businesses such as those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement population health management credentialing utilization management network management and member experience we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in many of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos and ppo markets and our wellness program go365 humana’s pharmacy organization is accredited by urac 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2020 we employed approximately 1400 sales representatives as well as approximately 1600 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare products including medicare advantage and pdp in our retail segment and specialty products in our group and specialty segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we have a marketing arrangement with walmart stores inc or walmart for our individual medicare standalone pdp offering we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers in addition we market our medicare and individual specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our group and specialty segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we use licensed independent brokers independent agents digital insurance agencies and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our specialty products 

underwriting 

since 2014 the patient protection and affordability care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law requires certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our individual medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have a larger membership base andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2020 form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system including the health care reform law 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

covid19 

our response to the pandemic and performance throughout 2020 would not have been possible without the extraordinary resilient efforts of our associates who went above and beyond to continually meet the needs of our stakeholders while facing their own daily challenges as a result of covid19 to support them we quickly transitioned nearly all of our workforce to a remote work environment while ensuring that our frontline care providers clinicians and pharmacists who continued to care for our members and patients in our clinics and in the home and ensure that they had access to their medications had the equipment and space to safely do so we also expanded our benefits to assist our associates who faced financial hardship and to address the difficulties that the pandemic presented to daily life a few of those covid19 response initiatives are highlighted below 

• transitioning approximately 94 of the workforce to workathome and equipping them with the necessary technology and resources for a successful remote work environment 

• providing funding for emergency relief for elder and child caregiving and financial hardship from family job loss food insecurity and household essentials 

• adjusting pay and leave policies to provide additional paid time off to manage personal challenges as a result of covid19 including school closings and child care

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends accordingly our reserves may be insufficient 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members including claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members and various other costs generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

• increased use of medical facilities and services 

• increased cost of such services 

• increased use or cost of prescription drugs including specialty prescription drugs 

• the introduction of new or costly treatments prescription drugs or new technologies 

• our membership mix 

• variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products benefits or lines of business product changes or benefit level changes 

• changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market 

• changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals 

• changes in our purchase discounts or pharmacy volume rebates received from drug manufacturers and wholesalers which are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts 

• catastrophes including acts of terrorism public health emergencies epidemics or pandemics such as the spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 or severe weather eg hurricanes and earthquakes 

• medical cost inflation and 

• government mandated benefits member eligibility criteria or other legislative judicial or regulatory changes 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part 

on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses any costs associated with exiting products additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors through the medicare annual enrollment period in addition contracts for the sale of group commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical and administrative costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare military and medicaid programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as changes to the programs in which we participate those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives and our statebased contracts strategy our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products in addition there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model and our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy and the attendant concentration of revenues intensifies the risks to us inherent in medicare products any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

the achievement of star ratings of 4star or higher qualifies medicare advantage plans for premium bonuses our medicare advantage plans operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings despite our operational efforts to improve our star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically maintain existing or implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems these systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have difficulty preventing and detecting fraud have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers and service providers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows the misappropriation of our proprietary information andor thirdparty infringement claims against any software products we use could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there can be no assurance that our information technology or it process will successfully maintain and improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information or improve service levels failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we 

could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data and rely on third party service providers to do the same including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty we have been and will likely continue to be regular targets of attempted cybersecurity attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of our information technology security systems although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or results of operations financial position or cash flow through december 31 2020 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such cybersecurity attacks or other information security risks or threats in the future a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems or the security of third party service providers could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders 

the costs to detect prevent eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures or the security measures of third party service providers and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our associates or members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment compensation and other labor and employment practice suits employee benefit claims stockholder suits and other securities laws claims intellectual and other property claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums claims relating to the denial of health care benefit payments claims relating to the denial or rescission of insurance coverage challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims claims relating to our administration of our medicare part d offerings medical malpractice actions brought against our employed providers or affiliated physicianowned professional groups based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for a thirdparty providers alleged malpractice claims arising from any adverse medical consequences resulting from our recommendations about the appropriateness of providers’ proposed medical treatment plans for patients allegations of anticompetitive and unfair business activities provider disputes over compensation or nonacceptance or termination of provider contracts disputes related to aso business including actions alleging claim administration errors qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government alleging that we as a government contractor submitted false claims to the government including among other allegations resulting from coding and review practices under the medicare riskadjustment model claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices claims relating to customer audits and contract performance claims relating to dispensing of drugs associated with our inhouse dispensing pharmacies and professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public 

in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 88 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

• at december 31 2020 under our contracts with cms we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 728300 individual medicare advantage members in florida these contracts accounted for approximately 14 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 the loss of these and other cms contracts which are generally renewed annually or significant changes in the medicare program as a result of legislative or regulatory action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• at december 31 2020 our military services business which accounted for approximately 1 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily consisted of the tricare t2017 east region contract the t2017 east region contract is a consolidation of the former t3 north and south regions comprising 32 states and approximately six million tricare beneficiaries under which delivery of health care services commenced on january 1 2018 the t2017 east region contract is a 5 year contract set to expire on december 31 2022 and is subject to renewals on january 1 of each year during its term at the governments option the loss of the tricare t2017 east region contract may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

• there is a possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs including medicare and medicaid if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false claims act as a government contractor we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government alleging that the government contractor submitted false claims to the government litigation of this nature is filed under seal to allow the government an opportunity to investigate and to decide if it wishes to intervene and assume control of the litigation if 

the government does not intervene the lawsuit is unsealed and the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own 

• cms uses a riskadjustment model which adjusts premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health status of covered members the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more where a plans membership has higher expected costs under this model rates paid to ma plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on our estimated cost of providing standard medicarecovered benefits to an enrollee with a national average risk profile that baseline payment amount is adjusted to reflect the health status of our enrolled membership under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government feeforservice program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims in addition we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model these compliance efforts include the internal contract level audits described in more detail below as well as ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes 

cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2020 50 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms increased that percentage to 75 for 2021 and will complete the phasedin transition from raps to eds by using only eds data to calculate risk scores in 2022 the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

cms and the office of the inspector general of health and human services or hhsoig are continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans 

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provided that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the radv audit sample would be extrapolated to the entire ma contract after a comparison of the audit results to a similar audit of the government’s traditional feeforservice medicare program or medicare ffs we refer to the process of accounting for errors in ffs claims as the ffs adjuster this comparison of radv audit results to the ffs error rate is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of radv audit results because the government used the medicare ffs program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set to estimate the costs of various health status conditions and to set the resulting adjustments to ma plans’ payment rates in order to establish actuarial equivalence in payment rates as required under the medicare statute cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern 

differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the medicare ffs program dataset 

the final radv extrapolation methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to cms radv contract level audits conducted for contract year 2011 and subsequent years cms is currently conducting radv contract level audits for certain of our medicare advantage plans 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feefor service business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been finalized we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows we report the results of these internal contract level audits to cms including identified overpayments if any 

on october 26 2018 cms issued a proposed rule and accompanying materials which we refer to as the “proposed rule” related to among other things the radv audit methodology described above if implemented the proposed rule would use extrapolation in radv audits applicable to payment year 2011 contractlevel audits and all subsequent audits without the application of a ffs adjuster to audit findings we believe that the proposed rule fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and have provided substantive comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process whether and to what extent cms finalizes the proposed rule and any related regulatory industry or company reactions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition as part of our internal compliance efforts we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to among other things our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the risk adjustment model these reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to cms that may either individually or in the aggregate be material as such the result of these reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we believe that cmss statements and policies regarding the requirement to report and return identified overpayments received by ma plans are inconsistent with cmss 2012 radv audit methodology and the medicare statutes requirements these statements and policies such as certain statements contained in the preamble to cms’s final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 which we refer to as the overpayment rule and the proposed rule appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without addressing the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above on september 7 2018 the federal district court for the district of columbia vacated cmss overpayment rule concluding that it violated the medicare statute including the requirement for actuarial equivalence and that the overpayment rule was also arbitrary and capricious in departing from cmss radv methodology without adequate explanation among other reasons cms has appealed the decision to the circuit court of appeals 

we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

• our cms contracts which cover members’ prescription drugs under medicare part d contain provisions for risk sharing and certain payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk these provisions certain of which are described below affect our ultimate payments from cms 

the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net asset of 95 million at december 31 2020 and net payable of 170 million at december 31 2019 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

• we are also subject to various other governmental audits and investigations under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance our hmos are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health audits and investigations including audits of risk adjustment data are also conducted by state attorneys general cms hhsoig the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor and the defense contract audit agency all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs including a limitation on our ability to market or sell products the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or changes in our business practices the outcome of any current or future governmental or internal investigations cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities nevertheless it is reasonably possible that any such outcome of litigation penalties fines or other sanctions could be substantial and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows certain of these matters could also affect our reputation in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or legislative judicial or regulatory changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

the health care reform law and other current or future legislative judicial or regulatory changes 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance industry fee which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate was suspended in 2019 resumed for calendar year 2020 and under current law has been permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021 

it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as other current or future legislative including the families first coronavirus response act the “families first act” the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to covid19 judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or restrictions on profitability including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage business profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

additionally potential legislative changes or judicial determinations including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law or declare all or certain portions of the health care reform law unconstitutional create uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes or judicial determinations may occur 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for the confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent these regulations set 

standards for the security of electronic health information including requirements that insurers provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened and strengthened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other requirements the hitech act and hipaa requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to hhs in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

we are subject to various federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws including the federal false claims act the “false claims act” the federal antikickback statute the “antikickback statute” the federal “stark law” and related state laws potential sanctions for violating these laws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts civil penalties treble damages and exclusion from participating in the medicare and medicaid programs or other government healthcare programs the false claims act prohibits knowingly submitting conspiring to submit or causing to be submitted false claims records or statements to the federal government or intentionally failing to return overpayments in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs the antikickback statute prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of business under medicare or other governmental health program the stark law prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for certain services to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship unless the financial relationship fits within a permissible exception 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made 

in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

in november 2020 the office of the inspector general of the department of health and humana services issued a final rule to eliminate under the antikickback statute’s regulatory discount safe harbor protection for rebates paid by manufacturers to part d plan sponsors or their pbms in connection with the sale or purchase of part d drugs this regulatory change is currently scheduled to become effective on january 1 2023 the final rule also introduced a new safe harbor to protect reductions in price from manufacturers on prescription drugs that are payable under medicare part d or by medicaid managed care organizations when such price reduction is offered at the point of sale the precise interpretation impact and legality of the final rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including capital adequacy and other licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic alliances may cause asset writeoffs restructuring costs or other expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic 

growth or profitability objectives and we may divest or wind down such businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us and the divestiture of certain businesses could result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the success of our care delivery businesses depends on our ability and the ability of our affiliated physicianowned professional groups and management services organizations to recruit hire acquire contract with and retain physicians and other medical professionals who are experienced in providing care services to older adults the market to acquire or manage physician practices and to employ or contract with individual physicians is and is expected to remain highly competitive and the performance of our care delivery businesses may be adversely impacted if we and our affiliated physicianowned professional groups and management services organizations are unable to attract maintain satisfactory relationships with and retain physicians and other medical professionals or if these businesses are unable to retain patients following the departure of a physician in addition our care delivery businesses contract with competitors of our health benefits businesses and these businesses could suffer if they are unable to maintain relationships with these companies or fail to adequately price their contracts with these thirdparty payers 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subject us to regulations and supply chain risks in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our inhouse dispensing pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies 

our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the us department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products including manufacturing distribution or other supply chain disruptions that could impact the availability or cost of supplying of such products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our inhouse dispensing pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital 

to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

we believe that certain of our customers place importance on our claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain future borrowings and investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

ongoing volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential credit related impairments are considered using a variety of factors including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or credit related impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment including the heightened uncertainty created by the covid19 pandemic we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the 

possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

the spread of and response to covid19 underscores certain risks we face including those discussed above and the ongoing heightened uncertainty created by the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact to us of covid19 

covid19 which has spread to every state in the united states and been declared a pandemic by the world health organization underscores certain risks we face including those discussed above to the extent that the spread of covid19 is not contained the premiums we charge may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members which may increase significantly as a result of higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs we may also experience increased costs or decreased revenues if as a result of our members being unable or unwilling to see their providers due to actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid19 we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members and appropriately document their risk profiles in addition we are offering and have been mandated by legislative and regulatory action including the families first act and cares act to provide certain expanded benefit coverage to our members such as waiving out of pocket costs for covid19 testing and treatment we are also taking actions designed to help provide financial and administrative relief for the health care provider community such measures and any further steps taken by us or governmental action to continue to respond to and to address the ongoing impact of covid19 including further expansion or modification of the services delivered to our members the adoption or modification of regulatory requirements associated with those services and the costs and challenges associated with ensuring timely compliance with such requirements to provide further relief for the health care provider community or in connection with the relaxation of stayathome and physical distancing orders and other restrictions on movement and economic activity including the potential for widespread testing and therapeutic treatments and the distribution and administration of covid19 vaccines could adversely impact our profitability 

the spread and impact of covid19 or actions taken to mitigate this spread could have material and adverse effects on our ability to operate effectively including as a result of the complete or partial closure of facilities or labor shortages disruptions in public and private infrastructure including communications availability of inperson sales and marketing channels financial services and supply chains could materially and adversely disrupt our normal business operations we have transitioned a significant subset of our employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 as have a number of our thirdparty service providers which may exacerbate certain risks to our business including an increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties the outbreak of covid19 has severely impacted global economic activity including the businesses of some of our commercial customers and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in the financial markets in addition to disrupting our operations these developments may adversely affect the timing of commercial customer premium collections and corresponding claim payments the value of our investment portfolio or future liquidity needs 

the ongoing heightened uncertainty created by the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact to us of covid19 we are continuing to monitor the spread of covid19 changes to our benefit coverages and the ongoing costs and business impacts of dealing with covid19 including the potential costs and impacts associated with lifting or reimposing restrictions on movement and economic activity the timing and degree in resumption of demand for deferred healthcare services the pace of administration of covid19 vaccines and the effectiveness of those vaccines and related risks the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its ultimate impact on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows is uncertain but such impacts could be material to our business results of operations financial position and cash flows

executive overview 

general 

humana inc headquartered in louisville kentucky is a leading health and wellbeing company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well‐being and lower costs our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with medicare families individuals military service personnel and communities at large to accomplish that we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients our members our range of clinical capabilities resources and tools such as in‐home care behavioral health pharmacy services data analytics and wellness solutions combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs excluding merger termination fee and related costs net and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

covid19 

during 2020 we took actions to protect inform and care for our members providers employees and other stakeholders associated with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus or covid19 specifically we highlight the following actions to support our members 

• waiving all cost sharing for covid19 treatment and testing including inpatient hospital admissions as well as innetwork primary care outpatient behavioral health and telehealth visits to reduce financial barriers to members seeking care and to reengage with their physician while continuing to encourage the use of telehealth 

• delivering meals to our senior members in need 

• making it easier for members to be tested for covid19 by offering athome testing as well as offering inhome preventive screening and diabetes testing kits to encourage members to seek preventive care that may have been delayed during the pandemic 

• proactively delivering safety kits including face masks to members and employee homes to facilitate access to care and support visits to providers safely 

• extending grace periods for premium payments for our fullyinsured commercial group members to ensure continuity of coverage during times of financial stress and 

• establishing a clinical outreach team to proactively engage with our most vulnerable members 

in addition we took steps to support our provider partners and boost system viability by 

• increasing provider funding simplifying and expanding claims processing and releasing advanced funding to providers to get reimbursement payments to providers as quickly as possible and ease financial concerns so that members are able to continue to access the care and information they need and 

• expanding modifications to certain utilization management processes to ease administrative stress and make sure providers are able to most efficiently care for their patients 

we also supported our workforce keeping them safe and addressing other needs during this time highlighting the following 

• transitioning nearly 94 of the workforce to workathome and equipping them with the necessary technology and resources for a successful remote work environment 

• providing funding for emergency relief for elder and child caregiving and financial hardship from family job loss food insecurity and household essentials 

• adjusting pay and leave policies to provide additional paid time off to manage personal challenges as a result of covid19 including school closings and child care 

finally we continued to support the communities we serve by donating 200 million to the humana foundation to address social determinants of health in an effort to promote more health days and encourage greater health equity 

the emergence and spread of covid19 has impacted our business beginning in the second half of march 2020 the implementation of stayathome and physical distancing orders and other restrictions on movement and economic activity resulted in the temporary deferral of nonessential care and significant reduction in hospital admissions and overall healthcare system utilization during april 2020 noncovid utilization then began to increase during may and june 2020 and continued to rebound throughout the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter of 2020 reaching approximately 95 of historic baseline levels as of the end of october 2020 then in the latter half of november and accelerating throughout the month of december we experienced a significant increase in covid19 admissions in nearly all of the markets in which we operate across our medicare advantage medicaid and group commercial insurance business lines resulting in higher covid19 treatment and testing costs during this period we also experienced a corresponding decline in noncovid utilization in all service categories to well below the near baseline levels of noncovid utilization witnessed as late as the end of october 2020 with noncovid utilization in our medicare advantage business running approximately 15 below normal levels at the close of the fourth quarter of 2020 the impact of this decline in noncovid utilization more than offset the higher covid19 treatment and testing costs during this period our 2020 results were also impacted by our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model 

we currently anticipate that the higher levels of covid19 admissions experienced late in 2020 and the corresponding decrease in noncovid utilization will continue for at least the first few months of 2021 over the course of 2021 we then expect covid utilization to decline as more of our members are vaccinated and that noncovid utilization will trend back to more normal levels the significant disruption in utilization during 2020 and in particular the unanticipated decline in noncovid utilization in november and december also impacted our ability to implement clinical initiatives to manage health care costs and chronic conditions of our members and appropriately document their risk profiles we currently expect this may impact our 2021 revenues under the risk adjustment payment model for medicare advantage plans but that these trends will also normalize in 2022 as noncovid utilization trends back to more normal levels throughout 2021 however the course and magnitude of these trends and their associated impact remains highly uncertain and subject to a significant number of variables and uncertainties including among others the severity and duration of the pandemic continued actions taken to mitigate the spread of covid19 including new covid19 variants and in turn relax those restrictions the timing and degree in resumption of demand for deferred health care services the pace of administration of covid19 vaccines and the effectiveness of those vaccines and level and cost of treatment and testing all of which are difficult to predict as such our response to this global health crisis and the subsequent recovery will continue to evolve over the coming months 

business segments 

we manage our business with three reportable segments retail group and specialty and healthcare services beginning january 1 2018 we exited the individual commercial fullyinsured medical health insurance business as well as certain other business in 2018 and therefore no longer report separately the individual commercial segment and the other businesses category in the current year previously the other businesses category included businesses that were not individually reportable because they did not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles primarily our closedblock of commercial longterm care insurance policies which were sold in 2018 the reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information 

the retail segment consists of medicare benefits marketed to individuals or directly via group medicare accounts in addition the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible and longterm support services benefits which we refer to collectively as our statebased contracts the group and specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups including dental vision and other supplemental health benefits as well as administrative services only or aso products in addition our group and specialty segment includes our military services business primarily our tricare t2017 east region contract the healthcare services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions provider services and clinical care service such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health including our nonconsolidating minority investment in kindred at home and the strategic partnership with wcas to develop and operate seniorfocused payoragnostic primary care centers 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from equity method investments or segment earnings transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and clinical care services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often use the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at a corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations 

seasonality 

covid19 disrupted the pattern of our quarterly earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 largely due to the temporary deferral of nonessential care which resulted in significant reductions in hospital admissions and lower overall healthcare system utilization during higher levels of covid19 hospital admissions similar impacts and seasonal disruptions from either higher or lower utilization are expected to persist as we respond to and recover from the covid19 global health crisis 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less 

in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of low income senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare marketing season 

our group and specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the group and specialty segment’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses 

recent transactions 

in the first quarter of 2020 we purchased privately held enclara healthcare or enclara one of the nation’s largest hospice pharmacy and benefit management providers for cash consideration of approximately 709 million net of cash received 

also in the first quarter of 2020 we entered into a strategic partnership with wcas to accelerate the expansion of our primary care model the wcas partnership opened 20 payoragnostic seniorfocused primary care centers during 2020 and is expected to open an additional 30 over the next 2 years 

these transactions are more fully discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

highlights 

• our 2020 results reflect the continued implementation of our strategy to offer our members affordable health care combined with a positive consumer experience in growing markets at the core of this strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused provided by both employed physicians and physicians with network contract arrangements the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience we believe this strategy is positioning us for longterm growth in both membership and earnings we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships at december 31 2020 approximately 2650100 members or 67 of our individual medicare advantage members were in valuebased relationships under our integrated care delivery model as compared to 2407000 members or 67 at december 31 2019 medicare advantage and dual demonstration program membership enrolled in a humana chronic care management program was 910600 at december 31 2020 an increase of 48 from 868800 at december 31 2019 these members may not be unique to each program since members have the ability to enroll in multiple programs the increase is driven by our improved process for identifying and enrolling members in the appropriate program at the right time coupled with growth in special needs plans or snp membership 

• on january 15 2021 centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms published its announcement of calendar year 2022 medicare advantage capitation rates and part c and part d payment policies or the final rate notice we expect the final rate notice to result in a 37 rate increase for non end stage renal disease or esrd medicare advantage business excluding the impact of employer group waiver plan or egwp funding changes our 37 rate increase compares to cms’s estimate for the sector of 408 on a comparable basis with the variance primarily driven by county rebasing and our geographic footprint cms also establishes separate rates of payment for esrd beneficiaries enrolled in medicare advantage plans we expect the final rate notice to result in a 50 rate increase in 2021 for esrd beneficiaries our estimate of 50 is equivalent to cms’s estimate 

the 2022 benchmark increase of 37 includes roughly 08 for the projected cost of covid19 vaccines 

• net income was 34 billion for 2020 compared to 27 billion in 2019 and earnings per diluted common share increased 521 from 2010 earnings per diluted common share in 2019 to 2531 earnings per diluted common share in 2020 these comparisons were significantly impacted by the change in the fair value of publiclytraded equity securities the net receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off and the putcall valuation adjustments associated with certain equity method investments the change in the fair value of our publiclytraded equity securities relates primarily to our common stock holdings including both the gain resulting from the initial conversion of our prior ownership interest in certain privately held companies primarily in oak street health inc or osh into common stock upon such companies initial public offering or ipo during the third quarter of 2020 and the subsequent changes in the market value of such securities from their ipo through the end of 2020 in 2020 we received 578 million net of related fees and expenses pursuant to the us supreme court ruling that the government is obligated to pay the losses under the risk corridor program the receipt of the risk corridor payments was associated with losses incurred under the health care reform business in 2014 to 2016 the receipt of these risk corridor payments accounted for less than half of our accumulated losses before income taxes from this business during that time period the impact of these adjustments to our consolidated income before income taxes and equity in net earnings and diluted earnings per common share was as follows for 2020 



• excluding these adjustments our results of operations reflect the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic comparisons were impacted by cost reductions due to lower noncovid utilization patterns from stayathome and physical distancing orders and other restrictions on movement offset by cost increases due to covid19 treatment and testing costs and our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model these changes were also favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per common share primarily reflecting share repurchases completed during 2019 partially offset by a higher tax rate resulting from the return of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 

health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance industry fee which is not deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increases our effective tax rate was suspended in 2019 resumed for calendar year 2020 and under current law has been permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021 

it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as other current or future legislative judicial or regulatory changes such as the families first coronavirus response act the families first act the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act and other legislative or regulatory action taken in response to covid19 including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or restrictions on profitability including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and clinical care services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers and are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data in this 2020 form 10k 

comparison of results of operations for 2020 and 2019 

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

consolidated

b represents total operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues less investment income 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased 112 billion or 179 from 629 billion for 2019 to 742 billion for 2020 primarily due to higher premium revenues from medicare advantage and statebased contracts membership growth higher per member medicare advantage premiums and the receipt of commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off partially offset by the impact of declining standalone pdp and fullyinsured group commercial medical membership as more fully described in the detailed segment results discussion that follows 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased 376 million or 261 from 14 billion for 2019 to 18 billion for 2020 primarily due to an increase in services revenue in the healthcare services segment associated with higher external pharmacy revenues resulting from the enclara acquisition in the first quarter of 2020 

investment income 

investment income was 12 billion for 2020 increasing 653 million or 1303 from 2019 primarily due to the 745 million change in fair value of publiclytraded equity securities during 2020 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 616 billion for 2020 an increase of 78 billion or 144 from 2019 the consolidated benefit ratio for 2020 was 831 a decrease of 250 basis points from 2019 primarily reflecting significantly depressed noncovid utilization in the first half of 2020 as well as the last two months of the fourth quarter the reinstatement of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 that was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products along with the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off these decreases were partially offset by the meaningful covid19 treatment and testing costs along with our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model as well as lower priorperiod medical claims reserve development 

we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 313 million in 2020 and 336 million in 2019 the favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 40 basis points in 2020 and 50 basis points in 2019 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased 27 billion or 362 from 2019 to 101 billion in 2020 reflecting an increase in operating costs in the retail and the group and specialty segments as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2020 was 132 increasing 170 basis points from 115 in 2019 primarily due to the reinstatement of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 covid19 related administrative costs including those associated with purchasing personal protective equipment for our clinicians and the buildout of infrastructure necessary to support employees working remotely higher marketing spend associated with the medicare annual election period or aep strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model and continued support for our constituents including a 200 million contribution to the humana foundation to support the communities served by us particularly those with social and health disparities also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by scale efficiencies associated with growth in our medicare advantage membership significant operating cost efficiencies in 2020 driven by previously disclosed productivity initiatives and the net impact of the receipt of the commercial risk corridor receivables previously written off the nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 160 basis points in 2020 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization in 2020 totaled 489 million compared to 458 million in 2019 an increase of 68 primarily due to capital expenditures 

interest expense 

interest expense was 283 million for 2020 compared to 242 million for 2019 an increase of 41 million or 169 this increase primarily was due to the higher average borrowings outstanding 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2020 was 280 compared to the effective tax rate of 220 in 2019 this change primarily was due to the reinstatement of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

retail segment 





segment earnings 

• retail segment earnings were 30 billion in 2020 an increase of 782 million or 350 compared to 22 billion in 2019 primarily resulting from the net favorable impact of a lower benefit ratio partially offset by a higher operating cost ratio as more fully described below

enrollment 

• fullyinsured commercial group medical membership decreased 131200 members or 144 from 908600 members as of december 31 2019 primarily reflecting lower membership in small group accounts due in part to more small group accounts selecting levelfunded aso products as well as the loss of certain large group accounts due to disciplined pricing in the competitive environment additionally the declines in membership were impacted by the current economic downturn driven by the covid19 pandemic resulting in higher unemployment rates and loss of coverage for fullyinsured commercial group members the portion of group fullyinsured commercial medical membership in small group accounts was approximately 54 at december 31 2020 and 59 at december 31 2019

• group and specialty segment services revenue decreased 10 million or 13 from 2019 to 2020 primarily due to lower aso membership described previously 

benefits expense 

• the group and specialty segment benefit ratio decreased 40 basis points from 860 in 2019 to 856 in 2020 primarily due to significantly depressed noncovid utilization in the first half of 2020 and again in the last two months of 2020 the reinstatement of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products and higher favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development these items were partially offset by meaningful covid19 treatment costs and testing and our ongoing pandemic relief efforts and strategic investments as previously described 

• the group and specialty segment’s benefits expense included the favorable effect of 47 million in priorperiod medical claims reserve development in 2020 versus the unfavorable effect of 50 million in favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development in 2019 this favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased the group and specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2020 while the unfavorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development increased the group and specialty segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2019 

operating costs 

• the group and specialty segment operating cost ratio of 250 for 2020 increased 300 basis points from 220 for 2019 primarily due to covid19 related administrative costs as previously discussed continued support for our constituents and strategic investments in the segment to position the business for longterm success and the reinstatement of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2020 these increases were partially offset by significant operating cost efficiencies driven by previously disclosed productivity initiatives

healthcare services segment 



segment earnings 

• healthcare services segment earnings were 944 million in 2020 an increase of 155 million or 196 from 2019 reflecting the same factors that resulted in a lower operating cost ratio as more fully described below as well as higher earnings from equity method investments in 2020 

script volume 

• humana pharmacy solutions ® script volumes for the retail and group and specialty segment membership increased to approximately 478 million in 2020 up 48 versus scripts of approximately 456 million in 2019 the increase primarily was driven by higher medicare advantage and statebased contracts membership partially offset by the decline in standalone pdp membership 

services revenue 

• services revenue increased 384 million or 608 from 2019 to 10 billion for 2020 primarily due to the additional pharmacy revenues associated with the acquisition of enclara in 2020 

intersegment revenues 

• intersegment revenues increased 23 billion or 90 from 2019 to 274 billion for 2020 primarily due to strong medicare advantage membership growth and a slight shift by members to 90day mail supply partially offset by the loss of intersegment revenues associated with the decline in standalone pdp membership 

operating costs 

• the healthcare services segment operating cost ratio of 963 for 2020 decreased 10 basis points from 964 in 2019 due to operational improvements and reduced utilization resulting from covid19 in our provider services business as well as significant operating cost efficiencies in 2020 driven by previously disclosed productivity initiatives these decreases were partially offset by covid19 administrative related costs including expenses associated with additional safety measures taken for our pharmacy provider and clinical teams who have continued to provide services to members during the covid19 pandemic the increase further reflects higher costs incurred in the pharmacy business to ensure timely delivery of prescriptions amid the covid19 pandemic and additional investments in the segments provider business related to marketing and aep initiatives 

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable benefits payable and other receivables and payables our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk the use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators

cash and cash equivalents increased to 47 billion at december 31 2020 from 41 billion at december 31 2019 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

the increase in operating cash flows in 2020 was primarily due to the impact of higher earnings and the timing of working capital items in particular the impact of medicare advantage membership growth on ibnr described below as claim payments related to new members lag the related premium collected 

the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



1 ibnr represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported ibnr at the balance sheet date and includes unprocessed claim inventories the level of ibnr is primarily impacted by membership levels medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received and processed ie a shorter time span results in a lower ibnr 

2 reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling as well as amounts owed to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to biweekly payments and the monthend cutoff 

3 other benefits payable include amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements 

the increase in benefits payable in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in ibnr mainly as a result of medicare advantage membership growth in addition 2020 was impacted by an increase in the amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements primarily related to medicare advantage membership growth in risk sharing arrangements and higher provider surplus amounts driven by lower utilization due to covid19 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards for further discussion of our reserving methodology including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2020 data 



a reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31 2020 caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent two months 

b reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable at december 31 2020 caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent two months 

c the factor change indicated represents the percentage point change 

the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for retail and group and specialty segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31 2020 net of reinsurance as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



a the factor change indicated represents the percentage point change 

as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 313 million in 2020 336 million in 2019 and 503 million in 2018 the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2020 2019 and 2018 



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2020 2019 and 2018 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2020 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms we bill and collect premiums from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium 

premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts retroactive membership adjustments and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law we estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets as defined by the health care reform law using a methodology prescribed by hhs separately by state and legal entity medicare advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the health care reform law estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government we routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in current operations premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses 

data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2020 50 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms increased that percentage to 75 for 2021 and will complete the phasedin transition from raps to eds by using only eds data to calculate risk scores in 2022 the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model including cms changes to the submission process is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” and in item 1a  risk factors 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 138 billion or 39 of total assets at december 31 2020 and 114 billion or 39 of total assets at december 31 2019 the investment portfolio was primarily comprised of debt securities detailed below at december 31 2020 and entirely at december 31 2019 the fair value of investment securities were as follows at december 31 2020 and 2019 



approximately 96 of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2020 most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale taxexempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the united states as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education our general obligation bonds are diversified across the united states with no individual state exceeding 1 of our total debt securities our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2020 



prior to january 1 2020 we applied the otherthantemporary impairment model for securities in an unrealized loss position which did not result in any material impairments for 2019 or 2018 beginning on january 1 2020 we adopted the new current expected credit losses or cecl model which retained many similarities from the previous otherthantemporary impairment model except eliminating from consideration in the impairment analysis the length of time over which the fair value had been less than cost also under the cecl model expected losses on available for sale debt securities are recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities for debt securities whose fair value is less than their amortized cost which we do not intend to sell or are not required to sell we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if an expected credit loss has occurred in the event of an expected credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the expected credit loss is recognized in income with the remainder if any of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value 

potential expected credit loss impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a debt security changes in the quality of the debt securitys credit enhancement payment structure of the debt security changes in credit rating of the debt security by the rating agencies failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments on the debt security and changes in prepayment speeds for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements we estimate the amount of the expected credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the expected credit loss cannot exceed the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value 

the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an 

investment is related to a credit event requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or expected credit loss impairments may be recorded in future periods 

all issuers of debt securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2020 remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the debt securities were purchased at december 31 2020 we did not intend to sell any debt securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis additionally we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position at december 31 2020 there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2019 or 2018 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2020 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 20 of total assets and 52 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 21 and 50 respectively at december 31 2019 

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

we use the onestep process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government reimbursement rates the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin however unfavorable changes in key assumptions or combinations of assumptions including a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reduction in our underlying cash flow assumptions including revenue growth rates medical and operating cost trends and projected operating income could have a significant negative impact on the estimated fair value of our clinical and provider reporting units which accounted for 524 million and 761 million respectively impairment tests completed for 2020 2019 and 2018 did not result in an impairment loss 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates 

or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense in the past we have and in the future we may enter into interest rate swap agreements depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 20 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread if drawn upon the revolving credit would revert to using the alternative base rate once libor is discontinuedthere were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2020 or december 31 2019 

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa at december 31 2020 our net unrealized position increased 303 million from a net unrealized gain position of 211 million at december 31 2019 to a net unrealized gain position of 514 million at december 31 2020 at december 31 2020 we had gross unrealized losses of 6 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased we did not record any material credit allowances for debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position during 2020 there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2019 while we believe that these impairments will be recovered and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 30 years as of december 31 2020 and 25 years as of december 31 2019 based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 541 million 

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2020 and 2019 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 10 year us treasury rates during the year have not exceeded 300 basis points have changed between 200 and 300 basis points once have changed between 100 and 200 basis points twice and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven times 



a as of december 31 2020 and 2019 some of our investments had interest rates below 1 and 2 respectively so the assumed hypothetical change in pretax earnings does not reflect the full 1 and 2 respectively point reduction 

b the interest rate under our senior notes is fixed there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at december 31 2020 or december 31 2019 there was 600 million and 300 million outstanding under our commercial paper program at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our interest rate under our commercial paper program was less than 1 so the assumed hypothetical change in pretax earnings does not reflect the full 1 point reduction

business segments 

we manage our business with three reportable segments retail group and specialty and healthcare services beginning january 1 2018 we exited the individual commercial fullyinsured medical health insurance business as 

well as certain other business in 2018 and therefore no longer report separately the individual commercial segment and the other businesses category in the current year previously the other businesses category included businesses that were not individually reportable because they did not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles primarily our closedblock of commercial longterm care insurance policies which were sold in 2018 the reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information   

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos include comprehensive managed care benefits generally through a participating network of physicians hospitals and other providers preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose any health care provider however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy solutions provider and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2019  



medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage or ma plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2019  25 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms will increase that percentage to 50 in 2020 and has proposed to increase that percentage to 75 in 2021  for more information refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and item 1a  risk factors 

at december 31 2019  we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 3587200 individual medicare advantage members including approximately 701400 members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 95 billion  which represented approximately 220 of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 150 of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2020  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2020 have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp offering cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data titled “medicare part d” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2020  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2020 have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

group medicare advantage and medicare standalone pdp 

we offer products that enable employers that provide postretirement health care benefits to replace medicare wrap or medicare supplement products with medicare advantage or standalone pdps from humana these products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s postretirement benefit structure 

statebased medicaid contracts 

our statebased contracts allow us to serve members enrolled in statebased medicaid programs including temporary assistance to needy families or tanf aged blind and disabled or abd longterm support services or ltss and the cms financial alignment dual eligible demonstration programs tanf and abd programs are traditional medicaid programs that are state and federally funded and provide cash assistance and supportive services to assist qualifying aged blind or disabled individuals as well as families with children under age 18 helping them achieve economic selfsufficiency ltss is a state and federally funded program that offers states a broad and flexible set of program design options and refers to the delivery of longterm support services for our members who receive home and community or institutionbased services for longterm care our contracts are generally for three to five year terms 

we have contracts to serve medicaid eligible members in florida and kentucky under traditional programs as well as contracts in florida under the ltss program prior to january 1 2020 our kentucky medicaid contract was subject to a 100 coinsurance contract with caresource management group company ceding all the risk to caresource effective january 1 2020 we terminated the reinsurance agreement with caresource and assumed full administration of our kentucky medicaid contract 

medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries or dual eligibles the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of medicaid and medicare costs states require special coordinating contracts for plans to offer medicare advantage dual eligible special needs plans or dsnps these largely operate separate from traditional medicaid and ltss programs some states are moving to support the dual eligible population by linking dsnp participation to enrollment in a plan that also participates in a statebased medicaid program to coordinate and integrate both medicare and medicaid benefits beginning in 2021 based on new federal requirements states are expected to strengthen medicaidmedicare integration requirements for dsnps 

we currently serve dual eligible members under the cms standalone dual eligible demonstration program in illinois and continue to serve other dual eligible members enrolled in our medicare advantage and standalone prescription drug plans

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2019  by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services 

and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate for diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2019  approximately 1289100 members or 77 of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts which provide all member benefits including 1116000 individual medicare advantage members or 311 of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 203800 hmo members including 196300 individual medicare advantage members or 176 of the 1116000 individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2019  with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 19 billion  or 36 of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2019  we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information set or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every three years unless otherwise required by state or federal regulations recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we maintain accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc andor urac certain commercial businesses such as those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement population health management credentialing utilization management network management and member experience we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in many of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos and ppo markets and our wellness program go365 humana’s pharmacy organization is accredited by urac 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2019  we employed approximately 1400 sales representatives as well as approximately 1400 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare including medicare advantage and pdp in our retail segment and specialty products in our group and specialty segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we have a marketing arrangement with walmart stores inc or walmart for our individual medicare standalone pdp offering we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers in addition we market our medicare and individual specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular 

customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our group and specialty segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we use licensed independent brokers independent agents digital insurance agencies and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our specialty products 

underwriting 

since 2014 the patient protection and affordability care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law requires certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have a larger membership base andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2019 form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system including the health care reform law 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a – risk factors in this 2019 form 10k 

certain other services 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation cybersecurity and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing billingenrollment and customer service through intercompany service agreements approved if required by state regulatory authorities humana inc our parent company charges a management fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 46000 employees and approximately 1200 additional medical professionals working under management agreements primarily between us and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 

information about our executive officers 

set forth below are names and ages of all of our current executive officers as of february 1 2020 their positions and the date first elected as an officer

 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns we continually review these estimates however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to 

appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses any costs associated with exiting products additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare military and medicaid programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as changes to the programs in which we participate those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives and our statebased contracts strategy our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products in addition there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model and our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we offer both standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plans with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer a medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 82 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 generated from our medicare products including 15 derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

the achievement of star ratings of 4star or higher qualifies medicare advantage plans for premium bonuses our medicare advantage plans operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings despite our operational efforts to improve our star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have reduced the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

there can be no assurance that our information technology or it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our 

information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty we have been and will likely continue to be regular targets of attempted cybersecurity attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of our information technology security systems although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or results of operations financial position or cash flow through december 31 2019 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such cybersecurity attacks or other information security risks or threats in the future a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems successfully could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders in certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process store and transmit large amounts of data for our businesses whose operations are subject to similar risks 

the costs to eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our associates or members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment compensation and other labor and employment practice suits employee benefit claims stockholder suits and other securities laws claims intellectual and other property claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 



 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 87 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  these programs involve various risks as described further below 



changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2019  25 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms will increase that percentage to 50 in 2020 and has proposed to increase that percentage to 75 in 2021  the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

cms and the office of the inspector general of health and human services or hhsoig are continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data 

we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans 

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provided that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the radv audit sample would be extrapolated to the entire ma contract after a comparison of the audit results to a similar audit of the government’s traditional feeforservice medicare program or medicare ffs we refer to the process of accounting for errors in ffs claims as the ffs adjuster this comparison of radv audit results to the ffs error rate is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of radv audit results because the government used the medicare ffs program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set to estimate the costs of various health status conditions and to set the resulting adjustments to ma plans’ payment rates in order to establish actuarial equivalence in payment rates as required under the medicare statute cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the medicare ffs program dataset 

the final radv extrapolation methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to cms radv contract level audits conducted for contract year 2011 and subsequent years cms is currently conducting radv contract level audits for certain of our medicare advantage plans 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feefor service business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been finalized we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows we report the results of these internal contract level audits to cms including identified overpayments if any 

on october 26 2018 cms issued a proposed rule and accompanying materials which we refer to as the “proposed rule” related to among other things the radv audit methodology described above if implemented the proposed rule would use extrapolation in radv audits applicable to payment year 2011 contractlevel audits and all subsequent audits without the application of a ffs adjuster to audit findings we believe that the proposed rule fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and have provided substantive comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process whether and to what extent cms finalizes the proposed rule and any related regulatory industry or company reactions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition as part of our internal compliance efforts we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to among other things our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the risk adjustment model these reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to cms that may either individually or in the aggregate be material as such the result of these reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we believe that cms statements and policies regarding the requirement to report and return identified overpayments received by ma plans are inconsistent with cms 2012 radv audit methodology and the medicare statutes requirements these statements and policies such as certain statements contained in the preamble to cms’ final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 which we refer to as the overpayment rule and the proposed 

rule appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without addressing the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above on september 7 2018 the federal district court for the district of columbia vacated cmss overpayment rule concluding that it violated the medicare statute including the requirement for actuarial equivalence and that the overpayment rule was also arbitrary and capricious in departing from cmss radv methodology without adequate explanation among other reasons cms has appealed the decision to the circuit court of appeals 

we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 170 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 



litigation penalties fines or other sanctions could be substantial and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows certain of these matters could also affect our reputation in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or legislative judicial or regulatory changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

the health care reform law and other current or future legislative judicial or regulatory changes 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended in 2019 but will resume for calendar year 2020 not be deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increase our effective tax rate in 2018 the fee levied on the health insurance industry was 143 billion  under current law the health industry fee will be permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021 

it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as other current or future legislative judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or restrictions on profitability including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage business profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

additionally potential legislative changes or judicial determinations including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law or declare all or certain portions of the health care reform law unconstitutional creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes or judicial determinations may occur 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes 

administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information including requirements that insurers provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa among other requirements the hitech act and hipaa mandate individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to hhs in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires hhs to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including capital adequacy and other licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic alliances may cause asset writeoffs restructuring costs or other expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives and we may divest or wind down such businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us the divestiture of certain businesses could result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses following the completion of the transaction for example in connection with a disposition we may enter into transition or administrative service agreements coinsurance arrangements vendor relationships or other strategic relationships with the divested business or we may agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in any such transaction each of which may result in additional expense and could have a material adverse effect on our result of operations 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive 

disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our inhouse dispensing pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the us department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products including manufacturing or other supply issues that could impact the availability of such products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our inhouse dispensing 

pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our inhouse dispensing and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would 

increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

executive overview 

general 

humana inc headquartered in louisville kentucky is a leading health and wellbeing company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well‐being and lower costs our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with medicare families individuals military service personnel and communities at large to accomplish that we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients our members our range of clinical capabilities resources and tools such as in‐home care behavioral health pharmacy services data analytics and wellness solutions combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs excluding merger termination fee and related costs net and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

business segments 

we manage our business with three reportable segments retail group and specialty and healthcare services beginning january 1 2018 we exited the individual commercial fullyinsured medical health insurance business as well as certain other business in 2018 and therefore no longer report separately the individual commercial segment and the other businesses category in the current year previously the other businesses category included businesses that were not individually reportable because they did not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles primarily our closedblock of commercial longterm care insurance policies which were sold in 2018 the reportable segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information 

the retail segment consists of medicare benefits marketed to individuals or directly via group medicare accounts in addition the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible and longterm support services benefits which we refer to collectively as our statebased contracts the group and specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups including dental vision and other supplemental health benefits as well as administrative services only or aso products in addition our group and specialty segment includes our military services business primarily our tricare t2017 east region contract the healthcare services segment includes our services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions provider services and clinical care service such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health including our minority investment in kindred at home 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from kindred at home or segment earnings transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered 

by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and clinical care services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers  intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often use the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at a corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations  

seasonality 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of low income senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare marketing season 

our group and specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the group and specialty segment’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses

highlights 

 in the advance notice cms estimates medicare advantage plans across the sector will on average experience a 093 percent increase in benchmark funding based on proposals included therein as indicated by cms its estimate excludes the impact of feeforservice county rebasingrepricing because the related impact is dependent upon finalization of certain data which will be available with the publication of the final notice based on our preliminary analysis using the same factors cms included in its estimate the components of 

which are detailed on cms’ website we anticipate that the proposals in the advance notice would result in a change to our benchmark funding relatively in line with cms’ estimate 

also on february 5 2020 cms issued a proposed rule which we refer to as the “2021 proposed rule” related to the administration of the ma and part d programs including among other things the agency’s implementation of recent legislation removing the limitation on ma eligibility for endstagerenaldisease or esrd medicareeligible beneficiaries beginning in 2021 allowing for medicare advantage plans to offer additional supplemental benefits including telehealth and addressing opioid recovery and treatment the 2021 proposed rule also recognizes the potential opportunity to create new options for beneficiaries including esrd beneficiaries and their access to care through greater flexibility around current network adequacy requirements cms has invited public comments to the 2021 proposed rule on or before april 6 2020 

the advance notice and the 2021 proposed rule are subject to the required notice and comment period and we cannot predict when or to what extent cms will adopt the proposals in the advance notice or the 2021 proposed rule we will be drawing upon our program expertise to provide cms formal commentary on the impact of both the advance notice and the 2021 proposed rule and the related impact upon medicare beneficiaries’ quality of care and service to our members through the ma and part d programs 

  



with operating costs in the condensed consolidated statements of income we expect this liability to be primarily paid within 12 months 

health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended in 2019 but will resume for calendar year 2020 not be deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increase our effective tax rate in 2018 the fee levied on the health insurance industry was 143 billion  under current law the health industry fee will be permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021 

it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as other current or future legislative judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or restrictions on profitability including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other increases in member benefits or changes to member eligibility criteria without corresponding increases in premium payments to us or increases in regulation of our prescription drug benefit businesses in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and clinical care services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers and are described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data in this 2019 form 10k 

comparison of results of operations for 2019 and 2018 

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  

consolidated 





summary 

net income for 2019 was 27 billion  or 2010 per diluted common share compared to 17 billion  or 1216 per diluted common share in 2018  this increase primarily was impacted by our medicare advantage business and healthcare services segment as well as by previously implemented productivity initiatives that led to significant operating cost efficiencies in 2019 these impacts were partially offset by strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model the impact of higher compensation accruals for the annual incentive plan or aip offered to employees across all levels of the company lower group and specialty segment earnings increased spending associated with the 2020 medicare annual election period or aep and the impact of workforce optimization these changes were further favorably impacted by the putcall valuation adjustments associated with our investment in kindred at home and by a lower number of shares used to compute dilutive earnings per share primarily reflecting share repurchases in addition 2019 was impacted by the loss on the sale of kmg recognized in 2018 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased 80 billion  or 146  from 549 billion for 2018 to 629 billion for 2019 primarily due to higher premiums in the retail segment driven by higher premium revenues from our medicare advantage business resulting from membership growth and higher per member premiums associated with individual medicare advantage these increases were partially offset by the impact of declining standalone pdp membership as well as lower premiums in the group and specialty segment as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue decreased 18 million  or 12  from 15 billion for 2018 to 14 billion for 2019  primarily due to a decrease in services revenue in the group and specialty segment partially offset by an increase in the healthcare services segment as detailed in the segment results discussion that follows 

investment income 

investment income was 501 million for 2019  decreasing 13 million  or 25  from 2018  primarily due to lower realized capital gains partially offset by higher average invested balances and interest rates 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 539 billion for 2019  an increase of 80 billion  or 174  from 2018 reflecting an increase in the retail and group and specialty segments benefits expense as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows as more fully described herein under the section entitled benefits expense recognition actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 336 million in 2019 and 503 million in 2018  

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2019 was 856  an increase of 210 basis points from 2018 primarily due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products lower favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development an increase in the group and specialty benefit ratio as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows and the shift in medicare membership mix due to the loss of standalone pdp members and significant growth in medicare advantage members these increases were partially offset by engaging our medicare advantage members in clinical programs as well as ensuring they are appropriately documented under the cms riskadjustment model and lower than expected medical costs as compared to the assumptions used in the pricing of our individual medicare advantage business for 2019 favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 50 basis points in 2019 and 90 basis points in 2018  

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs decreased 144 million  or 19  from 2018 to 74 billion in 2019 reflecting a decrease in operating costs in the retail and the group and specialty segments as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2019 was 115  decreasing 180 basis points from 133 in 2018 primarily due to the suspension of the health insurance industry fee in 2019 scale efficiencies associated with growth in our medicare advantage membership and significant operating cost efficiencies in 2019 driven by previously implemented productivity initiatives these improvements were partially offset by strategic investments in our integrated care delivery model the impact of higher compensation expense accruals in 2019 for the aip offered to employees across all levels increased spending associated with the medicare aep and charges associated with workforce optimization the higher compensation accruals resulted from our continued strong performance including customer satisfaction as measured by the net promoter score along with higher than anticipated individual medicare advantage membership growth the nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by approximately 180 basis points in 2018 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization in 2019 totaled 458 million compared to 405 million in 2018  an increase of 131  primarily due to capital expenditures 

interest expense 

interest expense was 242 million for 2019 compared to 218 million for 2018  an increase of 24 million  or 110 the increase was primarily due to the higher average borrowings outstanding including the impact of the borrowings under the november 2018 term loan agreement and senior notes issued in august 2019 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2019 was 220 compared to the effective tax rate of 189 in 2018  this change primarily reflects the impact of the suspension of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2019 as well as the deferred tax benefit recognized in 2018 from the loss on sale of kmg the effective income tax rate in 2018 reflected a 430 million deferred tax benefit resulting from the loss on the sale of kmg attributable to its original tax basis and subsequent capital contributions to fund accumulated losses see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

liquidity 

historically our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable benefits payable and other receivables and payables our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk the use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators 

for additional information on our liquidity risk please refer to item 1a – risk factors in this 2019 form 10k 

cash and cash equivalents increased to 41 billion at december 31 2019 from 23 billion at december 31 2018  the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in the timing of working capital items earnings and enrollment activity as discussed below the increase in operating cash flows in 2019 reflect the significant impacts of increasing premiums and enrollment as premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months higher earnings the timing of other working capital items and the impact of an approximately 245 million payment related to reinsuring certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products to a third party in connection with the sale of kmg in 2018 

the decrease in operating cash flows in 2018 primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee in 2017 net of related expenses and taxes paid funding the reinsurance of certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products to a third party in connection with the sale of kmg in 2018 and the timing of working capital items 

the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  



 the increase in benefits payable in 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to an increase in ibnr mainly as a result of medicare advantage membership growth in addition 2019 was impacted by an increase in the amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  



medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the decrease in commercial and other receivables in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due primarily to a decrease in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law this decrease corresponds with our exit from the individual commercial business 

military services receivables at december 31 2019  2018  and 2017 primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our tricare contracts the 2017 balance also includes transitionin receivables under our t2017 east region contract collected in 2018 

many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014 including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended for the calendar year 2017 but resumed in calendar year 2018the annual health insurance industry fee was again suspended in 2019 but will resume for calendar year 2020 not be deductible for income tax purposes and significantly increase our effective tax rate under current law the health industry fee will be permanently repealed beginning in calendar year 2021 we paid the federal government annual health insurance industry fees of 104 billion in 2018  

in addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense receipts for premiums and services revenues and amounts due under the health insurance industry fee provisions of the health care reform law other items impacting operating cash flows include income tax payments and the timing of payroll cycles 

cash flow from investing activities 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 736 million in 2019  612 million in 2018  and 524 million in 2017

during 2018 we paid cash consideration of approximately 11 billion to acquire a 40 minority interest in kindred at home 169 million to acquire the remaining interest in mcci and 185 million to acquire all of fpg as discussed in notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling 542 million 221 million  and 24 billion during 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

cash flow from financing activities 

our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year claims payments were 560 million higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk during 2019 and 653 million higher during 2018 receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claims subsidies for which we do not assume risk were 19 billion higher than claims payments during 2017 our net payable for cms subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was 229 million at december 31 2019 compared to a net payable of 331 million at december 31 2018  

under our administrative services only tricare contract health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by 63 million in 2019 and reimbursements from the federal 

government exceeded health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk by 38 million in 2018 and 11 million in 2017  

claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were 25 million in 2018 claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were higher than reimbursements from hhs by 44 million in 2017

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards for further discussion of our reserving methodology including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2019 data 





 the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for retail and group and specialty segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31 2019  net of reinsurance as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 336 million in 2019  503 million in 2018  and 483 million in 2017  the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2019  2018  and 2017  



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2019  2018  and 2017 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2019 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

there was no benefit expense excluded from the previous table for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 benefits expense reduced by 22 million associated with future policy benefits for the year ended december 31 2017 was excluded from the previous table 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms we bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium 

premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts retroactive membership adjustments and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law we estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets as defined by the health care reform law using a methodology prescribed by hhs separately by state and legal entity medicare advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the health care reform law estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government we routinely monitor the collectability of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in current operations premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2019  25 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds cms will increase that percentage to 50 in 2020 and has proposed to increase that percentage to 75 in 2021  the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model including cms changes to the submission process is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” and in item 1a  risk factors 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 114 billion  or 39 of total assets at december 31 2019  and 104 billion  or 41 of total assets at december 31 2018  the investment portfolio was primarily comprised of debt securities detailed below at december 31 2019 and entirely at december 31 2018  the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2019 and 2018  



approximately 96 of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2019  most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb  the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale taxexempt municipal securities were diversified among general obligation bonds of states and local municipalities in the united states as well as special revenue bonds issued by municipalities to finance specific public works projects such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education our general obligation bonds are diversified across the united states with no individual state exceeding 1 of our total debt securities our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2019  



under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2019 remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the securities were purchased at december 31 2019  we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2019  there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2019  2018  or 2017  

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2019  goodwill and other longlived assets represented 21 of total assets and 50 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 23 and 58  respectively at december 31 2018  

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

we use the onestep process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government rates the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill with the exception of our clinical and provider reporting units in our healthcare services segment our clinical and provider reporting units primarily provide services to our retail members a significant increase in the discount rate decrease in the longterm growth rate or substantial reductions in our underlying cash flow assumptions including revenue growth rates medical and operating cost trends and projected operating income could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units the clinical reporting unit had a fair value of 544 million which exceeded its carrying value of 533 million by 11 million or 2  if the discount rate increased 100 basis points then the clinical reporting unit would incur an impairment loss of approximately 62 million  the provider reporting unit had a fair value of 23 billion which exceeded its carrying value of 13 billion by 10 billion or 78  the provider reporting unit estimate of fair value relies on multiple assumptions regarding the underlying longterm cash flows any one of which may be significantly impacted by future changes in estimates and may negatively impact fair value the clinical and provider reporting units account for 524 million and 761 million  respectively of goodwill impairment tests completed for 2019  2018  and 2017 did not result in an impairment loss 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions 

change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense in the past we have and in the future we may enter into interest rate swap agreements depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 20 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2019 or december 31 2018  

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa at december 31 2019  our net unrealized position increased 415 million from a net unrealized loss position of 204 million at december 31 2018 to a net unrealized gain position of 211 million at december 31 2019  at december 31 2019  we had gross unrealized losses of 8 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2019  while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 25 years as of december 31 2019 and 29 years as of december 31 2018  based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 373 million  

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2019 and 2018  our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 10 year us treasury rates during the year have not exceeded 300 basis points have changed between 200 and 300 basis points once  have changed between 100 and 200 basis points four times  and have changed by less than 100 basis points five times

business segments 

we manage our business with four  reportable segments retail group and specialty healthcare services and individual commercial in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources  see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information   

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos include comprehensive managed care benefits generally through a participating network of physicians hospitals and other providers preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose any health care provider however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy solutions provider and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2018  

  

medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage or ma plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2018 15 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds in 2019 and 2020 cms will increase that percentage to 25 and 50 respectively for more information refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and item 1a  risk factors 

at december 31 2018  we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 3064000  individual medicare advantage members including approximately 636800  members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 82 billion  which represented approximately 230  of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 146  of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2019  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2019  have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp offering cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data titled “medicare part d” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2019  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2019  have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

group medicare advantage and medicare standalone pdp 

we offer products that enable employers that provide postretirement health care benefits to replace medicare wrap or medicare supplement products with medicare advantage or standalone pdps from humana these products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s postretirement benefit structure 

statebased medicaid contracts 

our statebased contracts allow us to serve members enrolled in statebased medicaid programs including temporary assistance to needy families or tanf aged blind and disabled or abd longterm support services or ltss and the cms financial alignment dual eligible demonstration programs tanf and abd programs are traditional medicaid programs that are state and federally funded and provide cash assistance and supportive services to assist qualifying aged blind or disabled individuals as well as families with children under age 18 helping them achieve economic selfsufficiency ltss is a state and federally funded program that offers states a broad and flexible set of program design options and refers to the delivery of longterm support services for our members who receive home and community or institutionbased services for longterm care our contracts are generally for three to five year terms 

we have contracts to serve medicaid eligible members in florida and kentucky under traditional programs as well as contracts in florida under the ltss program our kentucky medicaid contract is subject to a 100 coinsurance contract with caresource management group company ceding all the risk to caresource 

medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries or dual eligibles the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of medicaid and medicare costs states require special coordinating contracts for plans to offer medicare advantage dual eligible special needs plans or dsnps these largely operate separate from traditional medicaid and ltss programs some states are moving to support the dual eligible population by linking dsnp participation to enrollment in a plan that also participates in a statebased medicaid program to coordinate and integrate both medicare and medicaid benefits beginning in 2021 based on new federal requirements dsnps will be required to more fully integrate medicare and medicaid benefits and states will have authority to require linkages to statebased traditional medicaid andor ltss contracts or alternatively allow dsnps to operate without a link to such statebased contracts while meeting additional coordination standards cms has yet to finalize regulations 

we currently serve dual eligible members under the cms standalone dual eligible demonstration program in illinois and continue to serve other dual eligible members enrolled in our medicare advantage and standalone prescription drug plans

we have committed additional investments in our home care capabilities with our acquisition of a 40  minority interest in kindred at home inc or kindred at home and curo health services or curo which combined creates the nations largest home health and hospice provider with 65 overlap with our individual medicare advantage business see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2018  by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate for diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2018  approximately 1128500  members or 68  of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts which provide all member benefits including 942000  individual medicare advantage members or 307  of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 181200  hmo members including 168900  individual medicare advantage members or 179  of the 942000  individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2018  with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 15 billion  or 33  of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2018  we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information set or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national 

committee for quality assurance ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every three years unless otherwise required by state or federal regulations recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we maintain accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care aaahc andor urac all federal employee health benefit plans are required to be accredited certain commercial businesses such as those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement population health management credentialing utilization management network management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in many of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos and ppo markets and our wellness program go365 humana’s pharmacy organization is accredited by urac 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2018  we employed approximately 1500  sales representatives as well as approximately 1400  telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare including medicare advantage and pdp in our retail segment and specialty products in our group and specialty segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we have a marketing arrangement with walmart stores inc or walmart for our individual medicare standalone pdp offering we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers in addition we market our medicare and individual specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our group and specialty segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we use licensed independent brokers independent agents digital insurance agencies and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our specialty products 

underwriting 

since 2014 the patient protection and affordability care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law requires certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have a larger membership base andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2018  form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system including the health care reform law 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a – risk factors in this 2018  form 10k 

certain other services 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation cybersecurity and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing billingenrollment and customer service through intercompany service agreements approved if required by state regulatory authorities humana inc our parent company charges a management fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 41600  employees and approximately 2000  additional medical professionals working under management agreements primarily between us and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to our business 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns we continually review these estimates however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to 

appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses any costs associated with exiting products additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare military and medicaid programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives and our statebased contracts strategy our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products in addition there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model and our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we offer both standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plans with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer a medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 80  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  generated from our medicare products including 15  derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

the health care reform law created a federal medicaremedicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles this medicaremedicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of care between medicare and medicaid depending upon the results of those demonstration projects cms may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives to address the dual eligibles opportunity including our participation in statebased contracts or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members our business may be materially adversely affected 

the achievement of star ratings of 4star or higher qualifies medicare advantage plans for premium bonuses our medicare advantage plans operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings despite our operational efforts to improve our star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have reduced the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the 

software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

there can be no assurance that our information technology or it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty we have been and will likely continue to be regular targets of attempted cybersecurity attacks and other security threats and may be subject to breaches of our information technology security systems although the impact of such attacks has not been material to our operations or results of operations financial position or cash flow through december 31 2018 we can provide no assurance that we will be able to detect prevent or contain the effects of such cybersecurity attacks or other information security risks or threats in the future a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems successfully could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders in certain circumstances we may rely on third party vendors to process store and transmit large amounts of data for our businesses whose operations are subject to similar risks 

the costs to eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our associates or members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims stockholder suits and other securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 



 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 85  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  these programs involve various risks as described further below 



approximately 15  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  the loss of these and other cms contracts or significant changes in the medicare program as a result of legislative or regulatory action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2018 15 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds in 2019 and 2020 cms will increase that percentage to 25 and 50 respectively   the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic 

differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

cms and the office of the inspector general of health and human services or hhsoig are continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans   

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provided that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the radv audit sample would be extrapolated to the entire ma contract after a comparison of the audit results to a similar audit of medicare ffs we refer to the process of accounting for errors in ffs claims as the ffs adjuster this comparison of radv audit results to the ffs error rate is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of radv audit results because the government used the medicare ffs program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set to estimate the costs of various health status conditions and to set the resulting adjustments to ma plans’ payment rates in order to establish actuarial equivalence in payment rates as required under the medicare statute cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the medicare ffs program dataset 

the final radv extrapolation methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to cms radv contract level audits conducted for contract year 2011 and subsequent years cms is currently conducting radv contract level audits for certain of our medicare advantage plans 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feefor service business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been finalized we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows we report the results of these internal contract level audits to cms including identified overpayments if any 

on october 26 2018 cms issued a proposed rule and accompanying materials which we refer to as the “proposed rule” related to among other things the radv audit methodology described above if implemented the proposed rule would use extrapolation in radv audits applicable to payment year 2011 contractlevel audits and all subsequent audits without the application of a ffs adjuster to audit findings we are studying the proposed rule and cms’ underlying analysis contained therein we believe however that the proposed rule fails to address adequately the statutory requirement of actuarial equivalence and we expect to provide substantive comments to cms on the proposed rule as part of the noticeandcomment rulemaking process we are also evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule and any related regulatory industry or company reactions all or any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition as part of our internal compliance efforts we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to among other things our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the risk adjustment model these reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to cms that may either individually or in the aggregate be material as such the result of these reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

we believe that cms statements and policies regarding the requirement to report and return identified overpayments received by ma plans are inconsistent with cms 2012 radv audit methodology and the medicare statutes requirements these statements and policies such as certain statements contained in the preamble to cms’ final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 which we refer to as the overpayment rule and the proposed rule appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without addressing the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above on september 7 2018 the federal district court for the district of columbia vacated cmss overpayment rule concluding that it violated the medicare statute including the requirement for actuarial equivalence and that the overpayment rule was also arbitrary and capricious in departing from cmss radv methodology without adequate explanation among other reasons cms has filed a motion for reconsideration related to certain aspects of the federal district courts opinion and has simultaneously filed a notice to appeal the decision to the circuit court of appeals 

we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 170 million  and 279 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017 respectively 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately   9   months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 



general cms hhsoig the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor and the defense contract audit agency all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs including a limitation on our ability to market or sell products the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or changes in our business practices the outcome of any current or future governmental or internal investigations cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities nevertheless it is reasonably possible that any such outcome of litigation penalties fines or other sanctions could be substantial and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows certain of these matters could also affect our reputation in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

the health care reform law could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry the provisions of the health care reform law include among others imposing a significant new nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health care reform law also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers subject to federal administrative action and expands eligibility for medicaid programs subject to statebystate implementation of this expansion financing for these reforms come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected additionally potential legislative changes or judicial determinations including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law or declare all or certain portions of the health care reform law unconstitutional creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes or judicial determinations may occur 

 for additional information please refer to the section entitled “health care reform” in “item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” appearing in this annual report 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application including reductions in medicare advantage payment rates could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to the health care reform law the health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information including requirements that insurers provide customers with notice regarding how their nonpublic personal information is used including an opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa among other requirements the hitech act and hipaa mandate individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to hhs in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires hhs to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine fee 

splitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including capital adequacy and other licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic alliances may cause asset writeoffs restructuring costs or other expenses and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives and we may divest or wind down such businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestiture on terms favorable to us the divestiture of certain businesses could result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses following the completion of the transaction for example in connection with a disposition we may enter into transition or administrative service agreements coinsurance arrangements vendor relationships or other strategic relationships with the divested business or we may agree to provide certain indemnities to the purchaser in any such transaction each of which may result in additional expense and could have a material adverse effect on our result of operations 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive 

disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy mail order business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the us department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance   

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy 

business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would 

increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

general 

humana inc headquartered in louisville kentucky is a leading health and wellbeing company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well‐being and lower costs our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with medicare families individuals military service personnel and communities at large to accomplish that we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients our members our range of clinical capabilities resources and tools such as in‐home care behavioral health pharmacy services data analytics and wellness solutions combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs excluding merger termination fee and related costs net and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

business segments 

we manage our business with four  reportable segments retail group and specialty healthcare services and individual commercial in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources  see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information 

the retail segment consists of medicare benefits marketed to individuals or directly via group medicare accounts in addition the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible and longterm support services benefits which we refer to collectively as our statebased contracts the group and specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups including dental vision and other supplemental health benefits as well as administrative services only or aso products in addition our group and specialty segment includes military services business primarily our tricare t2017 east region contract the healthcare services segment includes our services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions provider services and clinical care service such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health including our investment in kindred at home the individual commercial segment consisted of our individual commercial fullyinsured medical health insurance business which we exited beginning january 1 2018 we report under the category of other businesses those businesses that do not align with the reportable segments described above primarily our closedblock longterm care insurance policies which were sold in 2018 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes and equity in net earnings from kindred at home or segment earnings transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and clinical care services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers  intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often use the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and 

certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at a corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations  

seasonality 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of low income senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare marketing season 

our group and specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the group and specialty segment’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses 

aetna merger 

on february 16 2017 under the terms of the agreement and plan of merger or merger agreement with aetna inc and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of aetna inc which we collectively refer to as aetna we received a breakup fee of 1 billion  from aetna which is included in our consolidated statement of income in the line captioned merger termination fee and related costs net 

acquisitions and divestitures 

on august 9 2018  we completed the sale of our whollyowned subsidiary kmg america corporation or kmg to continental general insurance company or cgic a texasbased insurance company wholly owned by hc2 holdings inc a diversified holding company   kmgs subsidiary kanawha insurance company or kic includes our closed block of nonstrategic commercial longterm care policies upon closing we funded the transaction with approximately 190 million of parent company cash contributed into kmg subject to customary adjustments in addition to the transfer of approximately 160 million of statutory capital with the sale in connection with the sale of kmg we recognized a pretax loss including transaction costs of 786 million and a corresponding 452 million  tax benefit prior to the sale of kmg we entered into reinsurance contracts to transfer the risk associated with certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products previously issued primarily by kic to a third party we transferred approximately 245 million   of cash to the third party and recorded a commensurate reinsurance recoverable as a result of these transactions the reinsurance recoverable was included as part of the net assets disposed there was no material impact to operating results from these reinsurance transactions 

on july 2 2018 and july 11 2018 we along with tpg capital or tpg and welsh carson anderson  stowe or wcas collectively the sponsors   completed the acquisitions of kindred and curo respectively merging curo with the hospice business of kindred at home as part of these transactions we acquired a 40 minority interest in the combined business kindred at home a for total cash consideration of approximately 11 billion

 health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee the annual health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry is 143 billion in 2018 and is not deductible for income tax purposes which significantly increases our effective income tax rate a one year suspension of the health insurance industry fee as we experienced in 2017 and are experiencing in 2019 significantly impacts our trend in key operating metrics including our operating cost and medical expense ratios as well as our effective tax rate the annual health insurance industry fee is scheduled to resume for calendar year 2020 under current law 

as noted above the health care reform law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective january 1 2014 with an annual 

open enrollment period although we previously participated in these exchanges by offering onexchange individual 

commercial medical plans effective january 1 2018 we have exited our individual commercial medical business 

on november 2 2017 we filed suit against the united states of america in the united states court of federal claims on behalf of our health plans seeking recovery from the federal government of approximately 611 million in payments under the risk corridor premium stabilization program established under the health care reform law for years 2014 2015 and 2016 our case has been stayed by the court pending resolution of similar cases filed by other insurers 

it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as future legislative judicial or regulatory changes including restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or restrictions on profitability including reviews by regulatory bodies that may compare our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability or compare the profitability of various products within our medicare advantage business and require that they remain within certain ranges of each other in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and 

clinical care services to our retail and group and specialty segment customers  and are described in note 17   to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this 2018  form 10k

consolidated 





summary 

net income for 2018  was 17 billion  or 1216  per diluted common share compared to 24 billion  or 1681  per diluted common share in 2017  this comparison was impacted by the loss on sale of kmg in 2018 the merger agreement breakup fee in 2017 the suspension of the health insurance industry fee for calendar year 2017 the exit out of the individual commercial business effective january 1 2018 a lower tax rate due to the tax reform law charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs in 2017 and the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense to support the policyholders obligation of penn treaty in 2017 after consideration of these items our earnings were favorably impacted by strong medicare advantage membership growth and significant operating efficiencies in 2018 driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017 these increases were partially offset by our offering of enhanced 2018 medicare advantage member benefits which resulted from the investment of the better than expected 2017 individual medicare advantage pretax earnings coupled with the return of the health insurance industry fee and the more severe flu season during the first quarter of 2018the comparison of diluted earnings per common share are also impacted by a lower number of shares from share repurchases 

  premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased   26 billion  or 49  from 524 billion  for 2017 to 549 billion  for 2018  primarily driven by higher medicare advantage revenues partially offset by the impact of lower revenues from the exit of the individual commercial business 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased   475 million  or 484  from 982 million  for 2017  to 15 billion  for 2018  primarily due to an increase in services revenue in the healthcare services and group and specialty segments as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows 

investment income 

investment income was 514 million  for 2018  increasing   109 million  or 269  from 2017  primarily due to higher realized capital gains and higher interest rates in 2018 partially offset by lower average invested balances

consolidated benefits expense was 459 billion  for 2018  an increase  of 24 billion  or 55  from 2017  reflecting an increase in the retail and group and specialty segments benefits expense as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the individual commercial segment benefits expense as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 503 million  in 2018  and 483 million  in 2017  

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2018  was 835  an increase  of 50  basis points from 2017  primarily due to the enhanced 2018 medicare advantage member benefits resulting from the investment of the better than expected 2017 individual medicare advantage pretax earnings and a more severe flu season in the first quarter of 2018 these items were partially offset by the positive impact from the reinstatement of the health insurance industry fee in 2018 which was contemplated in the pricing and benefit design of our products and higher favorable priorperiod reserve development favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased  the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 90  basis points in both 2018  and 2017  

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased   958 million  or 146  from 2017  to 75 billion  in 2018  reflecting an increase in the retail and group and specialty segments discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the individual commercial segment operating costs 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2018  was 133  increasing   100  basis points from 123  in 2017  primarily due to the reinstatement of the health insurance industry fee in 2018 and long term sustainability investments made in 2018 as a result of the tax reform law our longterm sustainability investments include the continuation of investments in our associate workforce primarily the establishment of an annual incentive program for a broader range of employees together with additional investments in the communities of our members technology and our integrated care delivery model to drive more affordable healthcare and better clinical outcomes and an increase in incentive compensation costs under the expanded program noted above the ratio was further impacted by the growth in our military services business which carries a higher operating ratio than our other products due to the previously disclosed transition to the t2017 east region contract effective january 1 2018 these items were partially offset by the favorable impact of significant operating cost efficiencies in 2018 driven by productivity initiatives implemented in 2017 the impact of the charges recorded in 2017 associated with the voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction program and the favorable yearoveryear comparison of the impact of the guaranty fund assessment expense to support policyholder obligations of penn treaty in 2017 as well as the exit of the individual commercial business effective january 1 2018 which carried a higher operating cost ratio than our other products the nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by approximately 180 basis points in 2018 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization in 2018  totaled 405 million  compared to 378 million  in 2017  an increase of 71  primarily due to capital expenditures the acquisitions of mcci and fpg and the writeoff of a trade name value reflecting the rebranding of certain provider assets 

interest expense 

interest expense was 218 million  for 2018  compared to 242 million  for 2017  a decrease  of 24 million  or 99  primarily as a result of the early redemption of higher rate debt in december 2017 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2018  was 189  compared to the effective tax rate of 391  in 2017  this decrease is primarily due to the tax reform law and the tax benefit resulting from the sale of kmg partially offset by the impact of the reinstatement of the nondeductible health insurance industry fee in 2018 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

historically our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities borrowings and proceeds from sales of businesses our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable benefits payable and other receivables and payables our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk the use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators

cash and cash equivalents decreased  to 23 billion  at december 31 2018  from 40 billion  at december 31 2017  the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in the timing of working capital items earnings and enrollment activity as discussed below the decrease in operating cash flows in 2018  primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee in 2017 net of related expenses and taxes paid funding the reinsurance of certain voluntary benefit and financial protection products to a third party in connection with the sale of kmg in 2018 and the timing of working capital items   

the increase in operating cash flows in 2017 primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee net of related expenses and taxes paid higher earnings and the timing of working capital items 

the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



 the increase  in benefits payable in 2018  was primarily due to an increase  in ibnr mainly as a result of medicare advantage membership growth the increase in benefits payable from 2016 to 2017 primarily was due to an increase in the amounts owed to providers under the capitated and risk sharing arrangements this was partially offset by a decrease in ibnr primarily driven by declines in individual commercial medical membership in the 2017 period partially offset by an increase in group medicare advantage membership benefits payable decreased in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in ibnr as well as the application of 2016 results to the premium deficiency reserve liability recognized in 2015 associated with our individual commercial medical products compliant with the health care reform law for the 2016 coverage year 

ibnr decreased during 2017 and 2016 primarily due to declines in individual and fullyinsured group commercial membership the decrease in ibnr during 2016 was also impacted by declines in group medicare advantage membership 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the decrease in commercial and other receivables in 2018 as compared to 2017 as well as the decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due primarily to a decrease in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law this decrease corresponds with our exit from the individual commercial business 

military services receivables at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our tricare contracts the 2017 balance also includes transitionin receivables under our t2017 east region contract collected in 2018 

many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014 including the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions as well as the nondeductible health insurance industry fee the effect of the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law also known as the 3rs has impacted our operating cash flows over the last three years but more significantly in 2017 and 2016 as the temporary risk corridor and reinsurance program provisions phased out in 2016 the timing of payments and receipts associated with these provisions impacted our operating cash flows as we built receivables for each coverage year that were expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years net collections under the 3rs associated with prior coverage years were 8 million  in 2018 440 million  in 2017  and 383 million in 2016 the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended for the calendar year 2017 but resumed in calendar year 2018 the annual health insurance industry fee was also suspended for the calendar year 2019 and under current law is scheduled to resume in calendar year 2020 we paid the federal government annual health insurance industry fees of 104 billion  in 2018  and  916 million  in 2016  

in addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense receipts for premiums and services revenues and amounts due under the risk limiting and health insurance industry fee provisions of the health care reform law other items impacting operating cash flows include income tax payments and the timing of payroll cycles 

cash flow from investing activities 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care 

coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 612 million  in 2018  524 million  in 2017  and 527 million  in 2016  

in 2018 we completed the sale of our whollyowned subsidiary kmg to cgic upon closing we funded the transaction with approximately 190 million of parent company cash contributed into kmg subject to customary adjustments in addition to the transfer of approximately 160 million of statutory capital with the sale total cash and cash equivalents including parent company funding disposed at the time of sale was 805 million see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

during 2018 we paid cash consideration of approximately 11 billion to acquire a 40 minority interest in kindred at home 169 million to acquire the remaining interest in mcci and 185 million to acquire all of fpg as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling 221 million  24 billion  and 828 million  during 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

cash flow from financing activities 

our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9  months after the close of each calendar year claims payments were   653 million   higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk  during 2018  receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claims subsidies for which we do not assume risk were 19 billion higher than claims payments during 2017  and were 11 billion higher than claims payments during 2016 our net payable for cms subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was 331 million  at december 31 2018  compared to a net payable of 10 billion  at december 31 2017  

under our administrative services only tricare contract reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk  by 38 million  in 2018  and by 11 million  in 2017  health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by 25 million  in 2016 

claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were 25 million in 2018 there were no reimbursements from hhs in 2018 claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were higher than reimbursements from hhs by 44 million in 2017 and by 28 million in 2016 

we repurchased common shares for 109  billion in 2018  and 337  billion in 2017 under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors and in connection with employee stock plans we did not repurchase shares in 2016 due to restrictions under the merger agreement 

as discussed further below we paid dividends to stockholders of 265 million  in 2018  220 million  in 2017  and 177 million  in 2016  

we entered into a commercial paper program in october 2014 net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 485 million  in 2018  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2018  was 923 million  net repayments of commercial paper were 153 million  in 2017  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2017  was 500 million  net repayments of commercial paper were 2 million  in 2016  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2016  was 475 million  

in december 2017 we issued 400 million  of 250  senior notes due december 15 2020 and 400 million  of 290  senior notes due december 15 2022 our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses paid as of december 31 2017 were 794 million  we used the net proceeds together with 

available cash to fund the redemption of our 300 million  aggregate principal amount of 630  senior notes maturing in august 2018 and our 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 720  senior notes maturing in june 2018 at 100  of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date for cash totaling approximately 829 million  

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2018  2017  and 2016  primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2018  was bbb  according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3  according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 250 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 1 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 3 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry humana inc our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company decreased to 578 million  at december 31 2018  from 688 million  at december 31 2017  this decrease primarily reflects acquisitions common stock repurchases insurance subsidiaries capital contributions and capital expenditures partially offset by insurance subsidiaries dividends noninsurance subsidiaries profits and net proceeds from debt issuance our use of operating cash derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by departments of insurance or comparable state regulatory agencies our regulated insurance subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of 23 billion  in 2018  14 billion  in 2017  and 08 billion  in 2016  refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i  parent company financial information the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in   2019   is approximately   1 billion  in the aggregate actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards for further discussion of our reserving methodology including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2018  data 



 the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for retail group and specialty and individual commercial segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31 2018  net of reinsurance as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 503 million  in 2018  483 million  in 2017  and 582 million  in 2016  the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2018  2017  and 2016  



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2018  2017  and 2016  primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2018  estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

benefits expense excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



in 2016 we increased our existing premium deficiency reserve initially recorded in 2015 for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law associated with the 2016 coverage year 

the higher benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable during 2016 primarily relates to reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care insurance policies which were sold in 2018 as more fully described  below and in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and certain contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms we bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly changes in premium revenues resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are estimated by projecting the ultimate annual premium and recognized ratably during the year with adjustments each period to reflect changes in the ultimate premium 

premiums revenue is estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates premiums revenue is recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services and is net of estimated uncollectible amounts retroactive membership adjustments and adjustments to recognize rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law we estimate policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the small group and large group markets as defined by the health care reform law using a methodology prescribed by hhs separately by state and legal entity medicare advantage products are also subject to minimum benefit ratio requirements under the health care reform law estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in current operations premiums received prior to the service period are recorded as unearned revenues 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those 

enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit diagnoses that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2018 15 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds in 2019 and 2020 cms will increase that percentage to 25 and 50 respectively   the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows  we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model including cms changes to the submission process is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” and in item 1a  risk factors 

  

 investment securities 

investment securities totaled 104 billion  or 41  of total assets at december 31 2018  and 123 billion  or 45  of total assets at december 31 2017  debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2018  and 2017  the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2018  and 2017  



approximately 97  of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa  by sp at december 31 2018  most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb  the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 118 million  at december 31 2018  and 222 million  at december 31 2017  these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established taxexempt municipal securities that were not prerefunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of us states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds general obligation bonds which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer accounted for 14 billion  of these municipals in the portfolio special revenue bonds issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education and supported by the revenues of that project accounted for 13 billion  of these municipals our general obligation bonds are diversified across the us with no individual state exceeding 9  

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2018  



under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2018  remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets since the time the securities were purchased at december 31 2018  we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2018  there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2018  2017  or 2016  

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2018  goodwill and other longlived assets represented 23  of total assets and 58  of total stockholders’ equity compared to 19  and 52  respectively at december 31 2017  with the increase due to our 2018 acquisitions 

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

we use the onestep process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government rates the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill with the exception of our clinical and provider reporting units in our healthcare services segment the margin on the clinical reporting unit would decline to less than 10 after factoring in a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate the provider reporting unit while not falling beneath this threshold was closer than any of our other reporting units the clinical and provider reporting units account for 524 million and 730 million respectively of goodwill 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense in the past we have and in the future we may enter into interest rate swap agreements depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 20 billion  unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2018  or december 31 2017  

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa  at december 31 2018  our net unrealized position decreased   402 million  from a net unrealized gain position of 198 million  at december 31 2017  to a net unrealized loss position of 204 million  at december 31 2018  at december 31 2018  we had gross unrealized losses of 213 million  on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2018  while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 29 years  as of december 31 2018  and 41 years  as of december 31 2017  based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 365 million  

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2018  and 2017  our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have not exceeded 300 basis points have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points twice  and have changed by less than 100 basis points eight  times

 general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc and its subsidiaries referred to throughout this document as “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “humana” is a leading health and wellbeing company committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well‐being and lower costs our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with medicare families individuals military service personnel and communities at large to accomplish that we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients our members our range of clinical capabilities resources and tools such as in‐home care behavioral health pharmacy services data analytics and wellness solutions combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective   

 as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 14 million  members in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 7 million  members in our specialty products during 2017  79  of our total premiums and services revenue were derived from contracts with the federal government including 15  derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms under which we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 609600  members as of december 31 2017  

humana inc was organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 and our website address is wwwhumanacom we have made available free of charge through the investor relations section of our web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statements and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission 

this annual report on form 10k or 2017  form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a – risk factors in this 2017  form 10k for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business 

aetna merger 

on july 2 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger which we refer to in this report as the merger agreement with aetna inc and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of aetna inc which we refer to collectively as 

aetna which sets forth the terms and conditions under which we agreed to merge with and become a wholly owned subsidiary of aetna a transaction we refer to in this report as the merger  on february 14 2017 we and aetna agreed to mutually terminate the july 2 2015 agreement and plan of merger as more fully discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

health care reform 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee and a threeyear industry wide commercial reinsurance fee the health care reform law is discussed more fully in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health care reform” in this 2017  form 10k 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected additionally potential legislative changes including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes may occur we may be unable to adjust our product offerings geographic footprint or pricing during any given year such legislative changes occur in sufficient time to mitigate any adverse effects 

business segments 

during the first quarter of 2017 we realigned certain of our businesses among our reportable segments to correspond with internal management reporting changes corresponding to those used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate results of operations and our previously announced planned exit from the individual commercial medical business on january 1 2018 additionally we renamed our group segment to the group and specialty segment and began presenting the individual commercial business results as a separate segment rather than as part of the retail segment specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision other supplemental health and financial protection products marketed to individuals are now included in the group and specialty segment specialty health insurance benefits marketed to employer groups continue to be included in the group and specialty segment as a result of this realignment our reportable segments now include retail group and specialty healthcare services and individual commercial prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2017 presentation   see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information   

we manage our business with four  reportable segments retail group and specialty healthcare services and individual commercial in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos generally require a referral from the member’s primary care provider before seeing certain specialty physicians preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral however ppos generally require 

the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy solutions provider and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2017  

  

medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may 

choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage or ma plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit claims that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2016 10 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds increasing to 25 of the risk score calculated from claims data through eds for 2017 in april 2017 cms revised the pace of the phasein for 2018 15 of the risk score will be calculated from claims data submitted through eds   

at december 31 2017  we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 2860800  individual medicare advantage members including approximately 609600  members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 78 billion  which represented approximately 238  of 

our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 146  of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2018  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2018  have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp offering cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data titled “medicare part d” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2018  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2018  have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

group medicare advantage and medicare standalone pdp 

we offer products that enable employers that provide postretirement health care benefits to replace medicare wrap or medicare supplement products with medicare advantage or standalone pdps from humana these products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s postretirement benefit structure

we have contracts to serve medicaid eligible members in florida and kentucky under the tanf program as well as contracts in florida under the ltss program our kentucky medicaid contract is subject to a 100 coinsurance contract with caresource management group company ceding all the risk to caresource 

medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries or dual eligibles the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of medicaid and 

medicare costs there were approximately 107 million  dual eligible individuals in the united states in 2017  trending upward due to medicaid eligibility expansions and individuals aging into the medicare program since the enactment of the health care reform law states are pursuing standalone dual eligible cms demonstration programs in which medicare medicaid and ltss benefits are more tightly integrated eligibility for participation in these standalone dual eligible demonstration programs may require statebased contractual relationships in existing medicaid programs 

we previously had an integrated care program or icp medicaid contract in illinois and a standalone dual eligible demonstration program in virginia both of which terminated on december 31 2017 we continue to serve other dual eligible members enrolled in our medicare advantage and standalone prescription drug plans

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2017  by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate for diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2017  approximately 1102100  members or 79  of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts including 903500  individual medicare advantage members or 316  of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 170700  hmo members including 155500  individual medicare advantage members or 172  of the 903500  individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2017  with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 14 billion  or 32  of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2017  we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and urac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo additionally all products sold on the federal and state marketplaces are required to be accredited certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in most of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos markets with enough history and membership and for many of our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2017  we employed approximately 1600  sales representatives as well as approximately 1300  telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare in our retail segment individual commercial health insurance in our individual commercial segment and specialty products in our group and specialty segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we have a marketing arrangement with walmart stores inc or walmart for our individual medicare standalone pdp offering we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers in addition we market our medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our group and specialty segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs 

and expectations of their employees or members in addition we offer plans to employer groups through private exchanges employers can give their employees a set amount of money and then direct them to a private exchange where employees can shop for a health plan and other benefits based on what the employer has selected as options we use licensed independent brokers independent agents and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products 

underwriting 

since 2014 the health care reform law requires all individual and certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly newly issued individual and certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have a larger membership base andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2017  form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a – risk factors in this 2017  form 10k 

certain other services 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing billingenrollment and customer service through intercompany service agreements approved if required by state regulatory authorities humana inc our parent company charges a management fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 45900  employees and approximately 2000  additional medical professionals working under management agreements primarily between us and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to certain proposed transactions 

certain proposed transactions including the divestiture of our subsidiary kmg and the acquisition of a minority interest in kindred healthcare inc’s kindred at home division are subject to various closing conditions including various regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed 

on november 6 2017 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the stock of our whollyowned subsidiary kmg to cgic a texasbased insurance company wholly owned by hc2 holdings inc a diversified holding company kmg’s subsidiary kic includes our closed block of nonstrategic commercial longterm care insurance policies that serves approximately 29800 policyholders on december 19 2017 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 40 minority interest in the kindred at home division of kindred healthcare inc consummation of each of these transactions involves certain risks including among other things the timing to consummate the transaction the risk that a condition to closing of the transaction may not be satisfied the risk that required regulatory approvals for the transaction are not obtained are delayed or are subject to conditions that are not anticipated the risk that we may not recognize all or a portion of the expected benefits from either or both transactions including tax benefits and expected synergies and the risk of indemnification exposure under the contractual agreements to effect the transactions 

risks relating to our business 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns we continually review these estimates however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 



 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including longterm care life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental insurance policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from the assumptions we have locked in additional future adjustments to reserves could be required 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses any costs associated with exiting products additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts participation in health insurance exchanges and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare military and medicaid programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives and our statebased contracts strategy our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products in addition there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model and our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we offer both standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plans with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer a medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 78  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  generated from our medicare products including 15  derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

the health care reform law created a federal medicaremedicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles this medicaremedicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of care between medicare and medicaid depending upon the results of those demonstration projects cms may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives to address the dual eligibles opportunity including our participation in statebased contracts or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members our business may be materially adversely affected 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial products introduction of new products and benefit designs including go365 and other wellness products growth of our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products the adoption of new technologies development of adjacent businesses and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

the achievement of star ratings of 4star or higher qualifies medicare advantage plans for premium bonuses our medicare advantage plans operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings despite our operational efforts to improve our star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have reduced the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

there can be no assurance that our information technology or it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause 

shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems successfully could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders 

the costs to eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our associates or members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims stockholder suits and other securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 



 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 84  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  these programs involve various risks as described further below 



does not intervene the lawsuit is unsealed and the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own 

 cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit claims that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2016 10 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds increasing to 25 of the risk score calculated from claims data through eds for 2017 in april 2017 cms revised the pace of the phasein for 2018 15 of the risk score will be calculated from claims data submitted through eds   the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans   

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provides that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the radv audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire ma contract after a comparison of the audit results to a similar audit of medicare ffs we refer to the process of accounting for errors in ffs claims as the ffs adjuster this comparison of radv audit results to the ffs error rate is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of radv audit results because the government used the medicare ffs program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set to estimate the costs of various health status conditions and to set the resulting adjustments to ma plans’ payment rates cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the medicare ffs program dataset 

the final radv extrapolation methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to radv contract level audits conducted for contract 

year 2011 and subsequent years cms is currently conducting radv contract level audits for contract years 2011 2012 and 2013 in which two five and five of our medicare advantage plans are being audited respectively per cms guidance selected ma contracts will be notified of an audit at some point after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feefor service business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been released we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows we report the results of these internal contract level audits to cms including identified overpayments if any however as indicated we are awaiting additional guidance from cms regarding the ffs adjuster accordingly we cannot determine whether such radv audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition as part of our internal compliance efforts we routinely perform ordinary course reviews of our internal business processes related to among other things our risk coding and data submissions in connection with the riskadjustment model these reviews may also result in the identification of errors and the submission of corrections to cms that may either individually or in the aggregate be material as such these ordinary course reviews may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition cms comments in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to ma plans appear to be inconsistent with cms prior radv audit guidance these statements contained in the preamble to cms’ final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 279 million  and 150 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016 respectively 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately   9   months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry the provisions of the health care reform law include among others imposing a significant new nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health care reform law also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers subject to federal administrative action and expands eligibility for medicaid programs subject to statebystate implementation of this expansion financing for these reforms come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected additionally potential legislative changes including activities to 

repeal or replace the health care reform law creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes may occur 

 for additional information please refer to the section entitled “health care reform” in “item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” appearing in this annual report 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application including reductions in medicare advantage payment rates could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to the health care reform law the health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa among other requirements the hitech act and hipaa mandate individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to hhs in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business 

associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires hhs to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure 

our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including capital adequacy and other licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives the divestiture of certain businesses could result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestitures on terms favorable to us 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy mail order business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the us department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance   

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it 

has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii 

request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

on july 2 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger which we refer to in this report as the merger agreement with aetna inc and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of aetna inc which we refer to collectively as aetna which sets forth the terms and conditions under which we agreed to merge with and become a wholly owned subsidiary of aetna a transaction we refer to in this report as the merger   on february 14 2017 we and aetna agreed to mutually terminate the merger agreement as our board determined that an appeal of the courts ruling would not be in the best interest of our stockholders   on february 16 2017 under the terms of the merger agreement we received a breakup fee of 1 billion  from aetna which is included in our consolidated statement of income in the line captioned merger termination fee and related costs net prior period merger related transaction costs previously included in operating costs have been reclassified to conform to the 2017 presentation 

acquisitions and divestitures 

   on december 19 2017 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 40  minority interest in the kindred at home division kindred at home of kindred healthcare inc kindrednyse knd the nation’s largest home health provider and second largest hospice operator for estimated cash consideration of approximately 800 million  including our share of transaction and related expenses to facilitate a complete separation from the long term acute care and rehabilitation businesses the specialty hospital company

these transactions are more fully discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

business segments 

during the first quarter of 2017 we realigned certain of our businesses among our reportable segments to correspond with internal management reporting changes corresponding to those used by our chief operating decision maker to 

evaluate results of operations and our previously announced planned exit from the individual commercial medical business on january 1 2018 additionally we renamed our group segment to the group and specialty segment and began presenting the individual commercial business results as a separate segment rather than as part of the retail segment specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision other supplemental health and financial protection products marketed to individuals are now included in the group and specialty segment specialty health insurance benefits marketed to employer groups continue to be included in the group and specialty segment as a result of this realignment our reportable segments now include retail group and specialty healthcare services and individual commercial prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2017 presentation   see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information   

we manage our business with four  reportable segments retail group and specialty healthcare services and individual commercial in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources   

the retail segment consists of medicare benefits marketed to individuals or directly via group accounts in addition the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible and longterm support services benefits which we refer to collectively as our statebased contracts the group and specialty segment consists of employer group commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits marketed to individuals and employer groups including dental vision and other supplemental health and voluntary insurance benefits and financial protection products as well as administrative services only or aso products in addition our group and specialty segment includes military services business primarily our tricare contract the healthcare services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions provider services and clinical care service such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health the individual commercial segment consists of our individual commercial fullyinsured medical health insurance benefits we report under the category of other businesses those businesses that do not align with the reportable segments described above primarily our closedblock longterm care insurance policies   

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and clinical care services to our retail group and specialty and individual commercial segment customers  intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often use the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at a corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations  

seasonality 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of low 

income senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare marketing season 

our group and specialty segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the group and specialty segment’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses 

certain of our fullyinsured individual commercial medical products in our individual commercial segment experience seasonality in the benefit ratio similar to the group and specialty segment including the effect of existing previously underwritten members transitioning to policies compliant with the health care reform law with us and other carriers as previously underwritten members transition it results in policy lapses and the release of reserves for future policy benefits partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred acquisition costs the recognition of a premium deficiency reserve for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law in the fourth quarter of 2015 and subsequent changes in estimate also impacted the quarterly benefit ratio pattern for this business in 2016

 health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee and a threeyear 25 billion industry wide commercial reinsurance fee the annual health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry is 143 billion in 2018 and is not deductible for income tax purposes which significantly increases our effective income tax rate a one year suspension in 2017 and 2019 of the health insurer fee significantly impacts our trend in key operating metrics including our operating cost and medical expense ratios as well as our effective tax rate 

in addition the health care reform law expands federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms comes in part from material additional fees and taxes on us as discussed above and other health plans and individuals which 

began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described in this 2017 form 10k 

as noted above the health care reform law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective january 1 2014 with an annual open enrollment period for 2017 we offered onexchange individual commercial medical plans in 11 states a reduction from the 15 states in which we offered onexchange coverage in 2016 in addition we discontinued substantially all health care reform law compliant offexchange individual commercial medical plans effective january 1 2017 effective january 1 2018 we have exited our remaining individual commercial medical business 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected additionally potential legislative changes including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes may occur we may be unable to adjust our product offerings geographic footprint or pricing during any given year such legislative changes occur in sufficient time to mitigate any adverse effects   

as discussed above it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as future legislative changes including legislative restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or regulatory restrictions on profitability including by comparison of our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability and a requirement that they remain within certain ranges of each other in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

on november 10 2016 the us court of federal claims ruled in favor of the government in one of a series of cases filed by insurers unrelated to us against hhs to collect risk corridor payments rejecting all of the insurer’s statutory contract and constitutional claims for payment on november 18 2016 hhs issued a memorandum indicating a significant funding shortfall for the 2015 coverage year the second consecutive year of significant shortfalls given the successful challenge of the risk corridor provisions in court congressional inquiries into the funding of the risk corridor program and significant funding shortfalls under the first two years of the program during the fourth quarter of 2016 we wroteoff   583 million  in risk corridor receivables outstanding as of september 30 2016 including   415 million   associated with the 2014 and 2015 coverage years from inception of the risk corridor program through december 31 2017 we collected approximately 39 million  from cms for risk corridor receivables associated with the 2014 coverage year funded by hhs in accordance with previous guidance utilizing funds hhs collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 and 2015 risk corridor program on november 2 2017 we filed suit against the united states of america in the united states court of federal claims on behalf of our health plans seeking recovery from the federal government of approximately 611 million  in payments under the risk corridor premium stabilization program established under the health care reform law for years 2014 2015 and 2016   

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and clinical care services to our retail group and specialty and individual commercial segment customers  and are described in note 17   to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this 2017  form 10k

consolidated 



 

summary 

net income for 2017  was 24 billion  or 1681  per diluted common share compared to 614 million  or 407  per diluted common share in 2016  net income in 2017  includes a net gain of 431 per diluted common share associated with the terminated merger agreement consisting primarily of the breakup fee and the beneficial effect of the lower effective tax rate in light of pricing and benefit design assumptions with the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee of 215 per diluted common share excluding the individual commercial business impact the yearoveryear comparison was also favorably impacted by a writeoff of 243  per diluted common share in receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program and   the reserve strengthening for our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance business of 211  per common diluted share recorded in 2016  these items were partially offset by the impact of the tax reform law enacted on december 22 2017 or the tax reform law which resulted in the reduction of our net income due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates of 092 per diluted common share 064  per common diluted share in charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs in 2017 as well as the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense to support the policyholder obligations of penn treaty an unaffiliated longterm care insurance company of 024 per diluted common share excluding the impacts of the items above the increase in net income primarily was due to yearoveryear improvements in earnings for our individual commercial retail and group and specialty segments partially offset by lower earnings in the healthcare services segment 

  premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums decreased   641 million  or 12  from 2016  to 524 billion  for 2017  primarily due to lower premiums in the individual commercial segment partially offset by higher premiums in the retail segment primarily resulting from growth in our medicare advantage business and higher premiums in the group and specialty segment as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased   13 million  or 13  from 2016  for 2017  primarily due to an increase in services revenue in the healthcare services segment partially offset by a decrease in services revenue in the group and specialty segment as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows 

investment income 

investment income was 405 million  for 2017  increasing   16 million  or 41  from 2016  primarily due higher average invested balances and interest rates in 2017  partially offset by lower realized capital gains 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 435 billion  for 2017  a decrease  of 15 billion  or 34  from 2016  reflecting 505 million  in incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies recorded in 2016 excluding the longterm care reserve strengthening in 2016  the decrease primarily was due to a decrease in the individual commercial segment benefits expense partially offset by an increase in the retail and group and specialty segments benefits expense as discussed in the detailed segment results discussion that follows as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 483 million  in 2017  and 582 million  in 2016  

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2017  was 830  a decrease  of 190  basis points from 2016  primarily due to the incremental benefits expense in 2016 for the reserve strengthening in our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies excluding the impact of the above the decrease in the consolidated benefit ratio primarily was due to the decrease in the individual commercial segment benefit ratio partially offset by the increase in the retail and group and specialty segment benefit ratio as discussed in the segment results of operation discussion that follows favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased  the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 90  basis points in 2017  versus approximately 110  basis points in 2016  

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs decreased   606 million  or 84  from 2016  to 66 billion  in 2017  primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for the calendar year 2017 and lower individual commercial membership this was partially offset by charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs an increase in employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance increased spending associated with the medicare annual election period or aep as well as the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense recorded to support the policyholder obligations of penn treaty an unaffiliated longterm care insurance company 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2017  was 123  decreasing   100  basis points from 2016  primarily due to the temporary suspension of the health insurance industry fee for the calendar year 2017 the writeoff of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program in 2016 as well as operating cost efficiencies partially offset by the loss of scale efficiency from market exits in the 2017 period associated with the individual commercial product the estimated charges associated with both voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs recorded in 2017 increased employee compensation costs resulting from the continued strong performance as well as the impact of the estimated guaranty fund assessment expense recorded to support the policyholder obligations of penn treaty an unaffiliated longterm care insurance company the nondeductible health insurance industry fee impacted the operating cost ratio by 170 basis points in 2016 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2017  of 378 million  was relatively unchanged from 2016  

interest expense 

interest expense was 242 million  for 2017  compared to 189 million  for 2016  an increase  of 53 million  or 280  due to the issuance of 18 billion in senior notes a portion of the proceeds which were used to redeem 800 million of senior notes scheduled to mature in 2018 we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately   17 million  in december 2017 for the redemption of these senior notes which is included in interest expense  

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2017  was 391  compared to the effective tax rate of 605  in 2016  primarily reflecting the suspension of the annual health insurance industry fee in 2017 as well as previously nondeductible transaction costs that as a result of termination of the merger agreement became deductible for tax purposes and were recorded as such in the first quarter of 2017 partially offset by the tax reform law which increased our effective tax rate due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets at lower enacted corporate tax rates see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate   

the tax reform law enacted on december 22 2017 significantly reduced our federal corporate tax rate as a result we expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 325  to 335  the decline in the effective tax rate for 2018 primarily is due to the enactment of tax reform partially offset by the resumption of the annual health insurance industry fee in 2018

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased   612 million  or 12  from 2015  to 530 billion  for 2016  primarily reflecting higher premiums in the retail segment mainly driven by average membership growth and per member premium increases for certain of our lines of business these increases were partially offset by the writeoff of 583 million  of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program the loss of premiums associated with a large group medicare account that moved to a private exchange on january 1 2016 and a decline in premiums revenue associated with fewer individual commercial medical members as discussed in our segment results of operations discussion that follows average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership

investment income 

investment income totaled 389 million  for 2016  a decrease  of 85 million  or 179  from 2015  primarily due to lower realized capital gains in 2016  and lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average invested balance 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 450 billion  for 2016  an increase  of 738 million  or 17  from 2015  primarily due to 505 million  in incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies partially offset by the premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year excluding the longterm care reserve strengthening and impact of the premium deficiency reserve the increase is primarily due to an increase in the retail segment mainly driven by higher average individual medicare advantage membership as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 582 million  in 2016  and 236 million  in 2015  the increase in priorperiod medical claims reserve development year overyear primarily was due to favorable yearoveryear comparisons for our medicare advantage and individual commercial medical businesses 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2016  was 849  an increase  of 40  basis points from 2015  primarily due to the incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies the impact on the benefit ratio of lower consolidated premiums associated with the writeoff of receivables for the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program and the impact of the premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year excluding the impact of the writeoff of the commercial risk corridor receivables and the premium deficiency reserve these items were partially offset by yearoveryear improvement in both the retail and group and specialty segment benefit ratios as discussed in the segment results of operations discussion that follows favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased  the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 110  basis points in 2016  versus approximately 50  basis points in 2015

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2016  was 133  decreasing   30  basis points from 2015  primarily due to the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 concentra carried a higher operating cost ratio than our group and specialty and retail segments this was partially offset by the unfavorable yearoveryear comparison associated with the temporary suspension of certain discretionary administrative costs in the latter half of 2015 along with the impact of the commercial risk corridor receivables writeoff in the fourth quarter of 2016 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2016  of 354 million  was relatively unchanged from 2015

 liquidity 

historically our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities borrowings and proceeds from sales of businesses our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable benefits payable and other receivables and payables our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk the use of cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators 

the effect of the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law have impacted the timing of our operating cash flows as we build receivables for each coverage year that are expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years net collections under the 3rs associated with prior coverage years were   440 million  in 2017 as compared to 383 million in 2016 as more fully described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data we wrote off 583 million  in risk corridor receivables outstanding as of september 30 2016 including   415 million   associated with the 2014 and 2015 coverage years from inception of the risk corridor program through december 31 2017 we collected approximately 39 million  from cms for risk corridor receivables associated with the 2014 coverage year funded by hhs in accordance with previous guidance utilizing funds hhs collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 and 2015 risk corridor program   on november 2 2017 we filed suit against the united states of america in the united states court of federal claims on behalf of our health plans seeking recovery from the federal government of approximately 611 million  in payments under the risk corridor premium stabilization program established under the health care reform law for years 2014 2015 and 2016 the remaining net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was approximately 31 million  at december 31 2017  including the 44 million  reinsurance receivable related to the 2016  coverage year as compared to 456 million  at december 31 2016  the remaining net receivable balance is primarily related to our individual commercial medical business which we have exited january 1 2018 

for additional information on our liquidity risk please refer to item 1a – risk factors in this 2017  form 10k 

cash and cash equivalents increased  to 40 billion  at december 31 2017  from 39 billion  at december 31 2016  the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in the timing of working capital items earnings and enrollment activity as discussed below the increase in operating cash flows in 2017  primarily was due to the receipt of the merger termination fee net of related expenses and taxes paid higher earnings and the timing of working capital items  the increase in operating cash flows in 2016 primarily was due to the timing of working capital items and higher earnings exclusive of the commercial risk corridor receivables writeoff and the longterm care reserve strengthening in 2016 as well as the gain on sale of concentra and the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve in 2015 discussed previously 

the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



 the increase  in benefits payable in 2017  largely was due to an increase in amounts owed under capitated risk sharing and quality incentive arrangements partially offset by a decrease  in ibnr benefits payable decreased in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in ibnr as well as the application of 2016 results to the premium deficiency reserve liability recognized in 2015 associated with our individual commercial medical products compliant with the health care reform law for the 2016 coverage year there was no premium deficiency reserve liability at december 31 2016 or 2017 the increase in benefits payable in 2015  largely was due to increases in ibnr and in the amount of processed but unpaid claims due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuates due to monthend cutoff these items were partially offset by a decrease in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements in 2015 including the disbursement of a portion of our medicare risk adjustment collections under our contractual obligations associated with our risk sharing arrangements in addition benefits payable in 2015 reflects the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve discussed previously 

ibnr decreased during 2017 and 2016 primarily due to declines in individual and fullyinsured group commercial membership the decrease in ibnr during 2016 was also impacted by declines in group medicare advantage ibnr increased during 2015 primarily as a result of individual medicare advantage membership growth as discussed previously our cash flows are impacted by changes in enrollment the decline in membership experienced in 2017 and 2016 negatively impacted operating cash flows for those years 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the decrease in commercial and other receivables in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily was due to a decrease in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law the increases in commercial and other receivables in 2016 and 2015 primarily reflect increases in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law 

military services receivables at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our tricare south region contract the 2017 balance also includes transitionin receivables under our t2017 east region contract with collection scheduled in 2018 

many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014 including the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions as well as the nondeductible health insurance industry fee as discussed previously the timing of payments and receipts associated with these provisions impacted our operating cash flows as we built receivables for each coverage year that were expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years net collections under the 3rs associated with prior coverage years were   440 million  as compared to net collections of 383 million  in 2016  the net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was approximately 31 million  at december 31 2017  including certain amounts recorded in receivables as noted above the annual health insurance industry fee was suspended for the calendar year 2017  but has resumed in calendar year 2018 the annual health insurance industry fee was also suspended for the calendar year 2019 and is scheduled to resume in calendar year 2020 we paid the federal government annual health insurance industry fees of 916 million  in 2016  and  867 million  in 2015  we have exited our individual commercial medical business effective january 1 2018  

in addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense receipts for premiums and services revenues and amounts due under the risk limiting and health insurance industry fee provisions of the health care reform law other items impacting operating cash flows include income tax payments and the timing of payroll cycles resulting in one less payroll cycle in 2016 than in 2015 

cash flow from investing activities 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 526 million  in 2017  527 million  in 2016  and 523 million  in 2015  

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling   24 billion  in 2017  and 828 million  in 2016  proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities exceeded purchases by   103 million  in 2015  these net proceeds were used to fund normal working capital needs due to an increase in receivables associated with the 3rs in addition to the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d reinsurance subsidies as discussed below 

in 2015 we purchased a 284 million   note receivable directly from a thirdparty bank syndicate related to the financing of mcci holdings llcs business as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data the purchase of this note is included with purchases of investment securities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 

on june 1 2015 we completed the sale of concentra for approximately 1055 million  in cash excluding approximately 22 million  of transaction costs 

cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 31 million  in 2017  7 million  in 2016  and 38 million  in 2015  acquisitions in each year included healthcare services segment related acquisitions 

cash flow from financing activities 

our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9  months after the close of each calendar year receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were   19 billion   higher than claims payments  during 2017  and were 11 billion  higher than claims payments during 2016  claim payments were 361 million  higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claims subsidies for which we do not assume risk during 2015  in 2015 we experienced higher specialty prescription drug costs associated with a new treatment for hepatitis c than were contemplated in our bids which resulted in higher subsidy receivable balances under the terms of our contracts with cms our net payable for cms subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was 10 billion  at december 31 2017  compared to a net receivable of 09 billion  at december 31 2016  refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

under our administrative services only tricare south region contract reimbursements from the federal government exceeded health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk  by 11 million  in 2017  health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by 25 million  in 2016  and 4 million  in 2015  

claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were higher than reimbursements from hhs  by 44 million  in 2017  and by 28 million  in 2016  claim payments were less than reimbursements by 69 million  in 2015  see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

we repurchased 1299 million  shares for 305 billion  in 2017  and 185 million  shares for 329 million  in 2015  under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors we did not repurchase shares in 2016 due to restrictions under the merger agreement we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 115 million  in 2017  104 million  in 2016  and 56 million  in 2015  

as discussed further below we paid dividends to stockholders of 220 million  in 2017  177 million  in 2016  and 172 million  in 2015  

we entered into a commercial paper program in october 2014 net repayments of commercial paper were 153 million  in 2017  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2017  was 500 million  net repayments of commercial paper were 2 million  in 2016  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2016  was 475 million  net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 298 million  in 2015  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2015  was 414 million  

in march 2017 we issued 600 million  of 395  senior notes due march 15 2027 and 400 million   of 480   senior notes due march 15 2047  our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses paid as of march 31 2017 were 991 million  the net proceeds from these issuances are being used for general corporate purposes 

in december 2017 we issued 400 million  of 250  senior notes due december 15 2020 and 400 million  of   290  senior notes due december 15 2022  our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses paid as of december 31 2017 were 794 million  we used the net proceeds together with available cash to fund the redemption of our 300 million  aggregate principal amount of 630  senior notes maturing in august 2018 and our 500 million  aggregate principal amount of 720  senior notes maturing in june 2018 at   100   of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  for cash totaling approximately 829 million  

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2017  2016  and 2015  primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft

for a detailed discussion of the above please refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2017  was bbb  according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3  according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 2 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 8 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry humana inc our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company decreased to 688 million  at december 31 2017  from 20 billion  at december 31 2016  this decrease primarily reflects common stock repurchases insurance subsidiaries capital contributions and capital expenditures partially offset by insurance subsidiaries dividends noninsurance subsidiaries profits and net proceeds from debt issuance our use of operating cash derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by departments of insurance or comparable state regulatory agencies our regulated subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of 14 billion  in 2017  763 million  in 2016  and 493 million  in 2015  subsidiary dividends in 2015 reflect the impact of losses for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law and the november 5 2015 revised statutory accounting guidance requiring the exclusion of risk corridor receivables from related statutory surplus refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i  parent company financial information excluding puerto rico subsidiaries the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in   2018   is approximately   11 billion  in the aggregate actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix 

our parent company funded a subsidiary capital contribution of approximately 535 million  in the first quarter of 2017 for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care insurance policies discussed further in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards for further discussion of our reserving methodology including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderately adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2017  data 



 the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for retail group and specialty and individual commercial segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31 2017  net of reinsurance as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 483 million  in 2017  582 million  in 2016  and 236 million  in 2015  the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2017  2016  and 2015  



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2017  2016  and 2015  primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2017  estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

benefits expense excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized a premium deficiency reserve for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law associated with the 2016 coverage year as discussed in more detail in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

military services benefits expense for each year in the table above reflect expenses associated with our contracts with the veterans administration 

the higher benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable during 2016 primarily relates to reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 kmg acquisition as more fully described  below and in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data certain health policies sold to individuals prior to 2014 the first year plans compliant with the health care reform law were effective are accounted for as longduration as more fully described below  benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable in 2015 primarily reflects the release of reserves as individual commercial medical members transitioned to plans compliant with the health care reform law 

future policy benefits payable of 29 billion  and 28 billion  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care insurance life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on premium rate increase interest rate mortality morbidity persistency the percentage of policies remaining inforce and maintenance expense assumptions interest rates are based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business mortality a measure of expected death and morbidity a measure of health status assumptions are based on published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is issued and only change if our expected future experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs ie the loss recognition date because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative we perform loss recognition tests at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums may not be adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs 

future policy benefits payable include 23 billion  at december 31 2017  and   22 billion  at december 31 2016   associated with a nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 acquisition of kmg  approximately 29800  policies remain in force as of december 31 2017  no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block future policy benefits payable includes amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income for an additional liability that would exist on our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies if unrealized gains on the sale of the investments backing such products had been realized and the proceeds reinvested at then current yields there was a 168 million  additional liability at december 31 2017  and 77 million   additional liability at december 31 2016  amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income are net of applicable deferred taxes 

longterm care insurance policies provide nursing home and home health coverage for which premiums are collected many years in advance of benefits paid if any therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligation under long term care policies because the long duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets further we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold to the extent premium rate increases interest rates andor loss experience vary from our loss recognition date assumptions future material adjustments to reserves could be required 

during 2016 we recorded a loss for a premium deficiency the premium deficiency was based on current and anticipated experience that had deteriorated from our lockedin assumptions from the previous december 31 2013 loss recognition date particularly as they related to emerging experience indicating longer claims duration a prolonged lower interest rate environment and an increase in policyholder life expectancies based on this deterioration we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our closed block of longterm care insurance policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits and maintenance costs under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during 2016 we recorded 505 million  of additional benefits expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 659 million  partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 154 million  included in other longterm assets   

for our closed block of longterm care policies actuarial assumptions used to estimate reserves are inherently uncertain due to the potential changes in trends in mortality morbidity persistency and interest rates as well as premium rate increases as a result our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if these trends develop adversely to our expectations the estimated increase in reserves and additional benefit expense from hypothetically modeling adverse variations in our actuarial assumptions in the aggregate could be up to 250 million  net of reinsurance although such hypothetical revisions are not currently appropriate we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectation of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur and any such revision could be material generally accepted accounting principles do not allow us to unlock our assumptions for favorable items 

in addition future policy benefits payable includes amounts of 199 million  at december 31 2017  201 million  at december 31 2016  and 205 million  at december 31 2015  which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per employee basis for each month of coverage based on the type of coverage purchased single to family coverage options our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premiums revenue and administrative services only or aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay and for estimated rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on 

available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from for our medicare and commercial medical products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997bba and the benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnoses data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit claims that satisfy those guidelines for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the encounter data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk scores for 2016 10 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds increasing to 25 of the risk score calculated from claims data through eds for 2017 in april 2017 cms revised the pace of the phasein for 2018 15 of the risk score will be calculated from claims data submitted through eds   the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows  we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model including cms changes to the submission process is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” 

  

 investment securities 

investment securities totaled 123 billion  or 45  of total assets at december 31 2017  and 98 billion  or 39  of total assets at december 31 2016  debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2017  and 2016  



approximately 98  of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa  by sp at december 31 2017  most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb  the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 222 million  at december 31 2017  and 276 million  at december 31 2016  these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established taxexempt municipal securities that were not prerefunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of us states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds general obligation bonds which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer accounted for 18 billion  of these municipals in the portfolio special revenue bonds issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education and supported by the revenues of that project accounted for 19 billion  of these municipals our general obligation bonds are diversified across the us with no individual state exceeding 9  in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our taxexempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 94 million  and 132 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively of taxexempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent weighted average sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa  

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was less than 1 million  at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 30  at december 31 2017  and 23  at december 31 2016  

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2017  



under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

the recoverability of our nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities is supported by factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements these residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities at december 31 2017  primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit support with over 99  of the collateral consisting of prime loans the weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgagebacked securities was aa  at december 31 2017  

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2017  remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets than when the securities were purchased at december 31 2017  we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2017  there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2017  2016  or 2015  

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2017  goodwill and other longlived assets represented 19  of total assets and 52  of total stockholders’ equity compared to 20  and 47  respectively at december 31 2016  

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition the carrying amount of goodwill for our reportable segments has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the 2017 segment change discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we use the onestep process to review goodwill for impairment to determine both the existence and amount of goodwill impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government rates the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill with the exception of our provider services reporting unit in our healthcare services segment the provider services reporting unit with 590 million of goodwill would decline to less than 10 margin after factoring in a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense prior to 2009 under interest rate swap agreements we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements in 2008 we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 20 billion  unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2017  or december 31 2016  

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa  at december 31 2017  our net unrealized position increased   226 million  from a net unrealized loss position of 28 million  at december 31 2016  to a net unrealized gain position of 198 million  at december 31 2017  at december 31 2017  we had gross unrealized losses of 88 million  on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2017  while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 41 years  as of december 31 2017  and 44 years  as of december 31 2016  based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 697 million  

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2017  and 2016  our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once  have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once  and have changed by less than 100 basis points eight  times

 item 1 business 

 general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc and its subsidiaries referred to throughout this document as “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “humana” is a leading health and wellbeing company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care our strategy integrates care delivery the member experience and clinical and consumer insights to encourage engagement behavior change proactive clinical outreach and wellness for the millions of people we serve across the country as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 142 million  members in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 70 million  members in our specialty products during 2016  75  of our total premiums and services revenue were derived from contracts with the federal government including 14  derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms under which we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 598100  members as of december 31 2016  

humana inc was organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 and our website address is wwwhumanacom we have made available free of charge through the investor relations section of our web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statements and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission 

this annual report on form 10k or 2016  form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a – risk factors in this 2016  form 10k for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business 

aetna merger 

on july 2 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger which we refer to in this report as the merger agreement with aetna inc and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of aetna inc which we refer to collectively as aetna which sets forth the terms and conditions under which we agreed to merge with and become a wholly owned subsidiary of aetna a transaction we refer to in this report as the merger 

  

the merger was subject to customary closing conditions including among other things i the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and the receipt of necessary approvals under state insurance and healthcare laws and regulations and pursuant to certain licenses of certain of humana’s subsidiaries and ii the absence of legal restraints and prohibitions on the consummation of the merger   

  on december 22 2016 in order to extend the “end date” as defined in the merger agreement aetna and humana each agreed to waive until 1159 pm eastern time on february 15 2017 its right to terminate the merger agreement due to a failure of the mergers to have been completed on or before december 31 2016   

on july 21 2016 the us department of justice and the attorneys general of certain us jurisdictions filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the district of columbia against us and aetna alleging that the merger would violate section 7 of the clayton antitrust act and seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the merger from being completed on january 23 2017 the court ruled in favor of the doj and granted a permanent injunction of the proposed transaction on february 14 2017 we and aetna agreed to mutually terminate the merger agreement as our board determined that an appeal of the courts ruling would not be in the best interest of our stockholders under terms of the merger agreement we are entitled to a breakup fee of 1 billion  

health care reform 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee and a threeyear industry wide commercial reinsurance fee the health care reform law is discussed more fully in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health care reform” in this 2016  form 10k 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected additionally potential legislative changes including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes may occur 

business segments 

we manage our business with three  reportable segments retail group and healthcare services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos generally require a referral from the member’s primary care provider before seeing certain specialty physicians preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the 

flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy solutions provider home based and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2016  

  

medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part 

c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage or ma plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnosis data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit those claims that pass the filtering logic for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the claims data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk adjustment data used to calculate risk scores for 2016 10 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds increasing to 25 of the risk score calculated from claims data through eds for 2017   

at december 31 2016  we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 2837600  individual medicare advantage members including approximately 598100  members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 77 billion  which represented approximately 242  of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 140  of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2017  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2017  have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp offering cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “medicare part d provisions” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2017  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2017  have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan

we offer products that enable employers that provide postretirement health care benefits to replace medicare wrap or medicare supplement products with medicare advantage or standalone pdps from humana these products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s postretirement benefit structure 

statebased medicaid contracts 

our statebased contracts allow us to serve members enrolled in statebased medicaid programs including temporary assistance to needy families or tanf longterm support services or ltss and dual eligible demonstration programs tanf is a state and federally funded program that provides cash assistance and supportive services to assist families with children under age 18 helping them achieve economic selfsufficiency ltss is a state and federally funded program that offers states a broad and flexible set of program design options and refers to the delivery of longterm support services for our members who receive home and community or institutionbased services for longterm care our contracts are generally for three to five year terms 

medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries or dual eligibles the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of medicaid and medicare costs there were approximately 104 million  dual eligible individuals in the united states in 2016  trending upward due to medicaid eligibility expansions and individuals aging into the medicare program since the enactment of the health care reform law states are pursuing standalone dual eligible cms demonstration programs in which medicare medicaid and ltss benefits are more tightly integrated eligibility for participation in these standalone dual eligible demonstration programs may require statebased contractual relationships in existing medicaid programs 

we have contracts to serve medicaid eligible members in florida under the tanf and ltss programs our contracts in virginia and illinois serve members under each state’s standalone dual eligible demonstration program in addition in illinois we have an integrated care program or icp medicaid contract our kentucky medicaid contract is subject to a 100 coinsurance contract with caresource management group company ceding all the risk to caresource 

 in addition to the dual eligible members we serve under the virginia and illinois demonstration program we serve other dual eligible members enrolled in our medicare advantage and standalone prescription drug plans as of december 31 2016  we served approximately 486000  dual eligible members in our medicare advantage plans and approximately 1179000  dual eligible members in our standalone prescription drug plans

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2016  by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

automatic reductions to the federal budget known as sequestration took effect on april 1 2013 including aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year due to the uncertainty around the application of these reductions there can be no assurances that we can completely offset any reductions to the medicare healthcare programs 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2016  approximately 1193400  members or 84  of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts including 921000  individual medicare advantage members or 325  of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 191300  hmo members including 170500  individual medicare advantage members or 185  of the 921000  individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2016  with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 13 billion  or 29  of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2016  we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and urac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo additionally all products sold on the federal and state marketplaces are required to be accredited certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in most of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos markets with enough history and membership and for many of our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2016  we employed approximately 1500  sales representatives as well as approximately 1300  telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare and individual commercial health insurance 

and specialty products in our retail segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we have a marketing arrangement with walmart stores inc or walmart for our individual medicare standalone pdp offering we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers in addition we market our medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our group segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members in addition we have begun to offer plans to employer groups through private exchanges employers can give their employees a set amount of money and then direct them to a private exchange where employees can shop for a health plan and other benefits based on what the employer has selected as options we use licensed independent brokers independent agents and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products 

underwriting 

since 2014 the health care reform law requires all individual and certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly newly issued individual and certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have a larger membership base andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2016  form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a – risk factors in this 2016  form 10k 

certain other services 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing billingenrollment and customer service through intercompany service agreements approved if required by state regulatory authorities humana inc our parent company charges a management fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 51600  employees and approximately 2600  additional medical professionals working under management agreements primarily between us and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to the terminated merger with aetna 

our proposed merger with aetna has affected and may in the future materially and adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

on february 14 2017 we and aetna agreed to mutually terminate our merger agreement as our board determined that an appeal of the courts ruling enjoining the transaction would not be in the best interest of our stockholders although difficult to quantify we believe that the proposed merger with aetna and subsequent termination of the merger agreement has affected and may in the future materially and adversely affect our results of operations due to the following 

 the occurrence continuation or exacerbation of any of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

risks relating to our business 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns we continually review these estimates however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 



 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including longterm care life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental insurance policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from the assumptions we have locked in additional future adjustments to reserves could be required 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses any costs associated with exiting products additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts participation in health insurance exchanges and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments under the health care reform law and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we may also face increased competition due to participation by other insurers in the health insurance exchanges implemented under the health care reform law we believe that barriers to entry 

in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare military medicaid and health insurance exchange programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our statebased contracts strategy and our participation in the new health insurance exchanges our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs and our participation in health insurance exchanges 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we offer both standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plans with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer a medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 74  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  generated from our medicare products including 14  derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

the health care reform law created a federal medicaremedicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles this medicaremedicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of care between medicare and medicaid depending upon the results of those demonstration projects cms may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives 

to address the dual eligibles opportunity including our participation in statebased contracts or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members our business may be materially adversely affected 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial products including participation in certain health insurance exchanges introduction of new products and benefit designs including go365 and other wellness products growth of our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products the adoption of new technologies development of adjacent businesses and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives including implementing our integrated care delivery model that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition there can be no guarantees that the reconsideration that we filed with respect to certain of our star rating measures for the 2018 bonus year will be successful that operational measures we may take will successfully mitigate any negative effects of star quality ratings for the 2018 bonus year or future years or that we will not experience a decline in membership growth for 2018 as a result of our 2018 bonus year star ratings 

the achievement of star ratings of 4star or higher qualifies medicare advantage plans for premium bonuses our medicare advantage plans operating results may be significantly affected by their star ratings despite our operational efforts to improve our star ratings there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years in addition audits of our performance for past or future periods may result in downgrades to our star ratings accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

on october 12 2016 cms published updated star quality ratings for the 2018 bonus year which showed that the percentage of our july 31 2016 medicare advantage membership in 4star plans or higher had declined to approximately 37 percent from approximately 78 percent of our july 31 2015 medicare advantage membership this decline in membership in 4star rated plans does not take into account certain operational actions we intend to take over the coming quarters to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on star bonus revenues for 2018 moreover we expect the impact of cms’ comprehensive program audit on our star ratings to be limited to the 2018 bonus year and star results for the 2018 bonus year are not expected to materially impact our medicare revenue for 2017 

we believe that our star ratings for the 2018 bonus year do not accurately reflect our actual performance under the applicable star measures consequently we have filed for reconsideration of certain of those ratings by cms under the appropriate administrative process 

there can be no guarantees however that the request for reconsideration that we filed with cms will be successful that any operational measures we may take will successfully mitigate all negative effects of our star quality ratings for the 2018 bonus year which could be material or that we will not experience a decline in membership growth for 2018 as a result of our 2018 bonus year star ratings 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have reduced the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and 

enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

there can be no assurance that our information technology or it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems successfully could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders 

the costs to eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims stockholder suits and other securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require 

us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 75  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  these programs involve various risks as described further below 



diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s traditional feeforservice medicare program referred to as medicare ffs under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government feeforservice program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims in addition we conduct medical record reviews as part of our data and payment accuracy compliance efforts to more accurately reflect diagnosis conditions under the risk adjustment model these compliance efforts include the internal contract level audits described in more detail below 

cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnosis data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit those claims that pass the filtering logic for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the claims data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk adjustment data used to calculate risk scores for 2016 10 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds increasing to 25 of the risk score calculated from claims data through eds for 2017 the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans   

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provides that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire ma contract based upon a comparison to “benchmark” audit data in medicare ffs which we refer to as the ffs adjuster this comparison to the ffs adjuster is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of audit results because the government program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set provides the basis for ma plans’ risk adjustment to payment rates cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the government program data set 

the final methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to radv contract level audits conducted for contract year 2011 and subsequent years cms is currently conducting radv contract level audits for contract years 2011 2012 and 2013 in which two five and five of our medicare advantage plans are being audited respectively per cms guidance selected ma contracts will be notified of an audit at some point after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited the final reconciliation occurs in august of the calendar year following the payment year 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feeforservice business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been released we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of 

these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows however as indicated we are awaiting additional guidance from cms regarding the ffs adjuster accordingly we cannot determine whether such radv audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition cms comments in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to ma plans appear to be inconsistent with cms prior radv audit guidance these statements contained in the preamble to cms’ final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 150 million  at december 31 2016  

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the applicable year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately   9   months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 



or sell products the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or changes in our business practices the outcome of any current or future governmental or internal investigations cannot be accurately predicted nor can we predict any resulting penalties fines or other sanctions that may be imposed at the discretion of federal or state regulatory authorities nevertheless it is reasonably possible that any such outcome of litigation penalties fines or other sanctions could be substantial and the outcome of these matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows certain of these matters could also affect our reputation in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry the provisions of the health care reform law include among others imposing a significant new nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health care reform law also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers subject to federal administrative action and expands eligibility for medicaid programs subject to statebystate implementation of this expansion in addition the health care reform law has increased and will continue to increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected additionally potential legislative changes including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes may occur 

 for additional information please refer to the section entitled “health care reform” in “item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” appearing in this annual report 

 our continued participation in the federal and state health insurance exchanges which entail uncertainties associated with mix volume of business and the operation of premium stabilization programs which are subject to federal administrative action could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the health care reform law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective january 1 2014 with an annual open enrollment period insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges must offer a minimum level of benefits and are subject to guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations we may be adversely selected by individuals who have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in this market in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the health care reform law established to apportion risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our products the risk corridor program is a three 

year program and the department of health and human services hhs guidance provides that risk corridor collections over the life of the three year program will first be applied to any shortfalls from previous benefit years before application to current year obligations on november 10 2016 the us court of federal claims ruled in favor of the government in one of a series of cases filed by insurers against hhs to collect risk corridor payments rejecting all of the insurer’s statutory contract and constitutional claims for payment on november 18 2016 hhs issued a memorandum indicating a significant funding shortfall for the 2015 coverage year the second consecutive year of significant shortfalls given the successful challenge of the risk corridor provisions in court congressional inquiries into the funding of the risk corridor program and significant funding shortfalls under the first two years of the program during the fourth quarter of 2016 we wroteoff our risk corridor receivables in addition other regulatory changes to the implementation of the health care reform law that allowed individuals to remain in plans that are not compliant with the health care reform law or to enroll outside of the annual enrollment period may have an adverse effect on our pool of participants in the health insurance exchange 

for 2017 we are offering onexchange individual commercial medical plans in 11 states a reduction from the 15 states in which we offered onexchange coverage in 2016 in addition we discontinued substantially all health care reform law compliant offexchange individual commercial medical plans in 2017 despite this reduction in our individual commercial membership plans the above factors in addition to competitor actions to withdraw from exchanges andor alter their product offerings may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows if our premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals in addition audits of our submissions under the risk adjustment program may result in repayment of amounts distributed under the program any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions used in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows and we may be unable to adjust our product offerings geographic footprint or pricing during any given year in sufficient time to mitigate any such effects 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application including reductions in medicare advantage payment rates could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to the health care reform law the health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa among other requirements the hitech act and hipaa mandate individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information 

provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to hhs in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires hhs to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended 

prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including capital adequacy and other licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which 

may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives the divestiture of certain businesses could result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestitures on terms favorable to us 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy mail order business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of 

prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the us department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance   

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

general 

humana inc headquartered in louisville kentucky is a leading health and wellbeing company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care our strategy integrates care delivery the member experience and clinical and consumer insights to encourage engagement behavior change proactive clinical outreach and wellness for the millions of people we serve across the country 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

aetna merger 

on july 2 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger which we refer to in this report as the merger agreement with aetna inc and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of aetna inc which we refer to collectively as aetna which sets forth the terms and conditions under which we agreed to merge with and become a wholly owned subsidiary of aetna a transaction we refer to in this report as the merger 

the merger was subject to customary closing conditions including among other things i the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and the receipt of necessary approvals under state insurance and healthcare laws and regulations and pursuant to certain licenses of certain of humana’s subsidiaries and ii the absence of legal restraints and prohibitions on the consummation of the merger   

  on december 22 2016 in order to extend the “end date” as defined in the merger agreement aetna and humana each agreed to waive until 1159 pm eastern time on february 15 2017 its right to terminate the merger agreement due to a failure of the mergers to have been completed on or before december 31 2016 

on july 21 2016 the us department of justice and the attorneys general of certain us jurisdictions filed a civil antitrust complaint in the us district court for the district of columbia against us and aetna alleging that the merger would violate section 7 of the clayton antitrust act and seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the merger from being completed on january 23 2017 the court ruled in favor of the doj and granted a permanent injunction of the proposed transaction on february 14 2017 we and aetna agreed to mutually terminate the merger agreement as our board determined that an appeal of the courts ruling would not be in the best interest of our stockholders   under terms of the merger agreement we are entitled to a breakup fee of 1 billion  

business segments 

we manage our business with three  reportable segments retail group and healthcare services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources   

the retail segment consists of medicare benefits marketed to individuals or directly via group accounts as well as individual commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products in addition the retail segment also includes our contract 

with cms to administer the linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible and longterm support services benefits collectively our statebased contracts the group segment consists of employer group commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and voluntary insurance benefits as well as administrative services only or aso products in addition our group segment includes our health and wellness products primarily marketed to employer groups and military services business primarily our tricare south region contract the healthcare services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions provider services home based services and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health we will continue to report under the category of other businesses those businesses which do not align with the reportable segments described above primarily our closedblock longterm care insurance policies   

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and home based services as well as clinical programs to our retail and group customers  intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often use the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at a corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations  

seasonality 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

our group segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the group segment’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses similarly certain of our fullyinsured individual commercial medical products in our retail segment experience seasonality in the benefit ratio akin to the group segment including the effect of existing previously underwritten members transitioning to policies compliant with the health care reform law with us and other carriers as previously underwritten members transition it results in policy lapses and the release of reserves for future policy benefits partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred acquisition costs these policy lapses generally occur during the first quarter of the new coverage year following the open enrollment period reducing the benefit ratio in the first quarter the recognition of a premium deficiency reserve for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law in the fourth quarter of 2015 and subsequent changes in estimates also impact the quarterly benefit ratio pattern for this business in 2016 and 2015 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare and individual health care exchange marketing seasons 

highlights 

consolidated 



 retail segment 



includes 40 basis points of negative impact associated with star quality bonuses sectorwide excluding that item cms estimate would be a 065 percent increase based on our preliminary analysis using the same factors cms included in its estimate the components of which are detailed on cms website we anticipate the proposals in the advance notice would result in a change to our benchmark funding relatively in line with cms estimate excluding the impact attributable to star quality bonuses we believe we can design our 2018 medicare advantage plan filings including the applicable level of rate changes to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original medicare with a supplement policy and medicare advantage products offered by our competitors failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 we believe that the decline is primarily attributable to the impact of lower scores for certain stars measures as a result of our 2015 comprehensive program audit by cms the civil monetary penalty imposed by cms following the audit resulted in a significant reduction to the beneficiary access and plan performance or bapp measure additionally an issue with the timeliness of appeal decisions noted in the audit resulted in automatic downgrades to two additional star measures moreover higher threshold levels for certain individual star measures as compared to the previous year reduced our ratings on these measures thresholds for star measures are calculated across the sector without regard to weighted average membership of each plan together these factors more than offset our improved star rating performance in certain quality measures such as healthcare effectiveness data and information or hedis 

our healthcare effectiveness data and information set or hedis measures demonstrating the achievement of clinical outcomes are at recordhigh results for the company accordingly we believe that our star ratings for the 2018 bonus year do not accurately reflect our actual performance under certain star measures consequently we filed for reconsideration of certain of those ratings under the appropriate administrative process we are also evaluating our contract structures for rationalization to mitigate the negative impact on star bonus revenues for 2018 

the ultimate financial impact to us related to 2018 star bonus revenues is dependent upon multiple variables including but not limited to the number of medicare advantage members in 4star or higher rated plans and the geographic distribution of those members as well as a number of operational initiatives which would serve to mitigate the negative impact of our star performance star results for the 2018 bonus year are not expected to materially impact our medicare revenue for 2017 but could be material to 2018 medicare revenues 



passing of the health care reform law resulting in higher covered population morbidity and the ensuing enrollment and claims issues causing volatility in claims experience we took a number of actions in 2015 that we believed would improve the profitability of our individual commercial medical business in 2016   these actions were subject to regulatory restrictions in certain geographies and included premium increases for the 2016 coverage year related generally to the first half of 2015 claims experience the discontinuation of certain products as well as exit of certain markets for 2016 network improvements enhancements to claims and clinical processes and administrative cost control despite these actions the deterioration in the second half of 2015 claims experience together with 2016 open enrollment results that included the retention of many highutilizing members for 2016 resulted in a probable future loss as a result of our assessment in the fourth quarter of 2015 of the profitability of our individual commercial medical policies compliant with the health care reform law we recorded in that quarter a provision for probable future losses premium deficiency reserve for the 2016 coverage year of 176 million  or 074  per diluted common share in 2016 we increased the premium deficiency reserve for the 2016 coverage year by 208 million  primarily as a result of unfavorable current and projected claims experience at that time as of december 31 2016 we had no remaining premium deficiency reserve 

for 2017 we are offering onexchange individual commercial medical plans in 11 states a reduction from the 15 states in which we offered onexchange coverage in 2016 in addition we discontinued substantially all health care reform law compliant offexchange individual commercial medical plans effective january 1 2017 our 2017 geographic presence for our individual commercial medical offerings covers 156 counties down from our 2016 presence in 1351 counties covering both onexchange and offexchange offerings given recent competitor actions including market exits resulting in the automatic assignment of members to our plans as well as sales and renewal results from the open enrollment process we now expect 2017 premiums associated with health care reform law compliant offerings to be in the range of 850 million to 900 million by comparison our full year 2016 premiums associated with health care reform law compliant offerings were 33 billion the decrease from 2016 results reflects the adjustment to our geographic presence and product discontinuances erosion of competitive position partially offset by premium increases as well as the projected impact of certain competitor actions 

on february 14 2017 we announced we are exiting our individual commercial medical businesses january 1 2018  as discussed previously we have worked over the past several years to address market and programmatic challenges in order to keep coverage options available wherever we could offer a viable product this has included pursuing business changes such as modifying networks restructuring product offerings reducing the company’s geographic footprint and increasing premiums   all of these actions were taken with the expectation that our individual commercial medical business would stabilize to the point where we could continue to participate in the program however based on our initial analysis of data associated with our healthcare exchange membership following the 2017 open enrollment period we are seeing further signs of an unbalanced risk pool therefore we have decided that we cannot continue to offer this coverage for 2018   



for full year 2017  we expect net membership growth in our group medicare advantage offerings of 70000 to 80000 

 january 2017  individual commercial medical membership approximated 204000  including 152000  enrolled in plans compliant with the health care reform law the decline  of approximately 450800  members or 69  from december 31 2016  reflects net membership declines during the ongoing open enrollment period for healthcare exchanges and the impact of product and service area reductions

 health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee and a threeyear 25 billion industry wide commercial reinsurance fee the annual health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry was 8 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts starting in 2018 and is not deductible for income tax purposes which significantly increased our effective income tax rate our effective tax rate for 2016  was approximately 605  the consolidated appropriations act 2016 enacted on december 18 2015 included a onetime one year suspension in 2017 of the health insurer fee   this suspension will significantly reduce our operating costs and effective tax rate in 2017  our effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 36  to 37   the decline in the effective tax rate primarily is due to the suspension of the annual health insurance industry fee in 2017  the health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry was previously expected to be 14 billion in 2017 in 2016  we paid the federal government 916 million  for the annual health insurance industry fee a 57  increase from 867 million  in 2015  primarily reflecting growth in our market share 

in addition the health care reform law expands federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms comes in part from material additional fees and taxes on us as discussed above and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described in this 2016  form 10k 

as noted above the health care reform law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective january 1 2014 with an annual open enrollment period insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges must offer a minimum level of benefits 

and are subject to guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations we may be adversely selected by individuals who have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in this market in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the health care reform law established to apportion risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our products and audits of our submissions under these programs may result in returns of funds distributed in addition regulatory changes to the implementation of the health care reform law that allowed individuals to remain in plans that are not compliant with the health care reform law or to enroll outside of the annual enrollment period may have an adverse effect on our pool of participants in the health insurance exchange in addition states may impose restrictions on our ability to increase rates all of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows if our premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions used in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows and could impact our decision to participate or continue in the program in certain states for 2017 we are offering onexchange individual commercial medical plans in 11 states a reduction from the 15 states in which we offered onexchange coverage in 2016 in addition we discontinued substantially all health care reform law compliant offexchange individual commercial medical plans effective january 1 2017 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected additionally potential legislative changes including activities to repeal or replace the health care reform law creates uncertainty for our business and we cannot predict when or in what form such legislative changes may occur  we may be unable to adjust our product offerings geographic footprint or pricing during any given year such legislative changes occur in sufficient time to mitigate any adverse effects 

as discussed above it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as future legislative changes including legislative restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or regulatory restrictions on profitability including by comparison of our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability and a requirement that they remain within certain ranges of each other in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows including the delayed receipt of amounts due under the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law 

on november 10 2016 the us court of federal claims ruled in favor of the government in one of a series of cases filed by insurers unrelated to us against hhs to collect risk corridor payments rejecting all of the insurer’s statutory contract and constitutional claims for payment on november 18 2016 hhs issued a memorandum indicating a significant funding shortfall for the 2015 coverage year the second consecutive year of significant shortfalls given the successful challenge of the risk corridor provisions in court congressional inquiries into the funding of the risk corridor program and significant funding shortfalls under the first two years of the program during the fourth quarter of 2016 we wroteoff   583 million  in risk corridor receivables outstanding as of september 30 2016 including   415 million   associated with the 2014 and 2015 coverage years from inception of the risk corridor program through december 31 2016 we collected approximately 36 million  from cms for risk corridor receivables associated with the 2014 coverage year funded by hhs in accordance with previous guidance utilizing funds hhs collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 and 2015 risk corridor program   

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and home based services as well as clinical programs to our retail and group customers  and are described in note 17   to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this 2016  form 10k 

comparison of results of operations for 2016  and 2015   

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  

consolidated 



 summary 

net income for 2016 was 614 million  or 407  per diluted common share in 2016  compared to 13 billion  or 844  per diluted common share in 2015  net income includes a writeoff of 243  per diluted common share in 

receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program   and reserve strengthening for our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance business   of 211  per diluted common share as discussed below these items were partially offset by the impact of the premium deficiency reserve of 074  per diluted common share recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year in addition the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 resulted in an aftertax gain of 157  per diluted common share in 2015 excluding these items the increase primarily was due to yearoveryear improvement in results for our individual medicare advantage business and our healthcare services segment as well as increased profitability in our statebased medicaid business partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate as discussed below in addition 2016  includes expenses of 064  per diluted common share and 2015  includes expenses of  014  per diluted common share for transaction and integration planning costs associated with the merger certain of which were not deductible for tax purposes 

  premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased   612 million  or 12  from 2015  to 530 billion  for 2016  primarily reflecting higher premiums in the retail segment mainly driven by average membership growth and per member premium increases for certain of our lines of business these increases were partially offset by the writeoff of 583 million  of receivables associated with the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program the loss of premiums associated with a large group medicare account that moved to a private exchange on january 1 2016 and a decline in premiums revenue associated with fewer individual commercial medical members as discussed in our segment results of operations discussion that follows average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue decreased   437 million  or 311  from 2015  to 10 billion  for 2016  primarily due to the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 

investment income 

investment income totaled 389 million  for 2016  a decrease  of 85 million  or 179  from 2015  primarily due to lower realized capital gains in 2016  and lower interest rates partially offset by a higher average invested balance   

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 450 billion  for 2016  an increase  of 738 million  or 17  from 2015  primarily due to 505 million  in incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies partially offset by the premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year excluding the longterm care reserve strengthening and impact of the premium deficiency reserve the increase is primarily due to an increase in the retail segment mainly driven by higher average individual medicare advantage membership as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 582 million  in 2016  and 236 million  in 2015  the increase in priorperiod medical claims reserve development year overyear primarily was due to favorable yearoveryear comparisons for our medicare advantage and individual commercial medical businesses 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2016  was 849  an increase  of 40  basis points from 2015  primarily due to the incremental benefits expense for the reserve strengthening in our nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies the impact on the benefit ratio of lower consolidated premiums associated with the writeoff of receivables for the commercial risk corridor premium stabilization program and the impact of the premium deficiency reserve 

recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year excluding the impact of the writeoff of the commercial risk corridor receivables and the premium deficiency reserve these items were partially offset by yearoveryear improvement in both the retail and group segment benefit ratios as discussed in the segment results of operations discussion that follows favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased  the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 110  basis points in 2016  versus approximately 50  basis points in 2015  

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs decreased   41 million  or 06  from 2015  to 73 billion  in 2016  primarily due to the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2016  was 135  decreasing   10  basis points from 2015  primarily due to the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 concentra carried a higher operating cost ratio than our group and retail segments this was partially offset by the unfavorable yearoveryear comparison associated with the temporary suspension of certain discretionary administrative costs in the latter half of 2015 along with the impact of the commercial risk corridor receivables writeoff in the fourth quarter of 2016 in addition transaction and integration planning costs associated with the merger increased the operating cost ratio by 20 basis points in 2016 there was minimal impact for transaction costs to the operating cost ratio in 2015 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2016  of 354 million  was relatively unchanged from 2015  

interest expense 

interest expense was 189 million  for 2016  compared to 186 million  for 2015  an increase  of 3 million  or 16  

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2016  was 605  compared to the effective tax rate of 475  in 2015  primarily reflecting lower pretax income yearoveryear the beneficial effect of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 and the impact of nondeductible transaction costs associated with the merger nondeductible transaction and integration planning costs associated with the merger increased our effective tax rate by approximately 34  percentage points in 2016  versus approximately 04  percentage points in 2015  conversely the tax effect of the sale of concentra reduced our effective tax rate by approximately 45  percentage points in 2015 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate our effective tax rate for 2017   is expected to be approximately 36  to 37   the decline in the effective tax rate primarily is due to the suspension of the annual health insurance industry fee in 2017 

the effective tax rate for 2016 also reflects tax benefits associated with adopting new guidance related to the accounting for employee sharebased payments effective january 1 2016 as described in note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report which decreased our effective tax rate by approximately 12 percentage points in 2016

as previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2016 we increased future policy benefits expense by approximately 505 million  for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care insurance policies this increase primarily was driven by emerging experience indicating longer claims duration a prolonged lower interest rate environment and an increase in policyholder life expectancies as discussed further in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this 2016  form 10k 

comparison of results of operations for 2015  and 2014   

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  

consolidated 



 summary 

net income was 13 billion  or 844  per diluted common share in 2015  compared to 11 billion  or 736  per diluted common share in 2014  the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 resulted in an aftertax gain of 157 per diluted common share in 2015 excluding the impact of the sale of concentra the decrease primarily was 

due to a decline in retail segment pretax results including expense of 074  per diluted common share for a premium deficiency reserve for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year and an increase in the effective tax rate as discussed below these items were partially offset by yearoveryear improvement in the group and healthcare services segment pretax results and higher investment income in addition 2015  includes expenses of 014 per diluted common share for transaction costs associated with the merger certain of which were not deductible for tax purposes net income for 2014  includes expenses of 015 per diluted common share associated with a loss on extinguishment of debt for the redemption of certain senior notes in 2014  yearoveryear comparisons of diluted earnings per common share are also favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per common share in 2015  reflecting the impact of share repurchases 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased   65 billion  or 140  from 2014  to 524 billion  for 2015  primarily reflecting higher premiums in both the retail and group segments these higher premiums were primarily driven by average membership growth in the retail segment and an increase in fullyinsured group commercial medical per member premiums in the group segment 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue decreased   758 million  or 350  from 2014  to 14 billion  for 2015  primarily due to the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 as well as the loss of certain large group aso accounts as a result of continued discipline in pricing of services for selffunded accounts amid a highly competitive environment 

investment income 

investment income totaled 474 million  for 2015  an increase  of 97 million  from 2014  primarily due to higher realized capital gains in 2015 as a result of the repositioning of our portfolio given recent market volatility and anticipated changes to interest rates with higher average invested balances being substantially offset by lower interest rates 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 443 billion  for 2015  an increase  of 61 billion  or 160  from 2014  primarily due to an increase in the retail segment mainly driven by higher average medicare advantage membership and individual commercial medical onexchange and offexchange membership in plans compliant with the health care reform law as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 236 million  in 2015  and 518 million  in 2014  the decline in priorperiod medical claims reserve development year overyear primarily was due to medicare advantage and individual commercial medical claims development in the retail segment as discussed further in the segment results of operations discussion that follows 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2015  was 845  an increase  of 150  basis points from 2014  primarily due to increases in the retail segment including the impact of recognizing a premium deficiency reserve for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year and group segment ratios as discussed in the segment results of operations discussion that follows the increase in benefits expense associated with the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve increased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 30 basis points in 2015 favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 50 basis points in 2015 versus approximately 110 basis points in 2014 

operating costs 

consolidated operating costs decreased   321 million  or 42  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to cost management initiatives across all lines of business as well as the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 partially offset by increases in costs mandated by the health care reform law including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2015  was 136  decreasing   230  basis points from 2014  primarily due to decreases in the operating cost ratios in the group and retail segments reflecting cost management initiatives as well as the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 concentra carried a higher operating cost ratio 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2015  totaled 355 million  increasing 22 million  or 66  from 2014  reflecting higher depreciation expense from capital expenditures 

interest expense 

interest expense was 186 million  for 2015  compared to 192 million  for 2014  a decrease  of 6 million  or 31  primarily reflecting a higher average longterm debt balance due to the issuance of senior notes in september 2014 partially offset by the recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 37 million  in october 2014 for the redemption of our 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2016 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2015  was 475  compared to the effective tax rate of 472  in 2014  the increase in the effective tax rate primarily was due to an increase in the nondeductible health insurance industry fee from 2014 substantially offset by the favorable tax effect of the gain on the sale of concentra see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

   liquidity 

historically our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities borrowings and proceeds from sales of businesses our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable benefits payable and other receivables and payables our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of operating cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators 

the effect of the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law impact the timing of our operating cash flows as we build receivables for each coverage year that are expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years during 2016 net collections under the 3rs associated with prior coverage years were   383 million  we expect to collect the remaining 54 million   of reinsurance recoverables related to prior coverage years in 2017   on november 10 2016 the us court of federal claims ruled in favor of the government in one of a series of cases filed by insurers unrelated to us against hhs to collect risk corridor payments rejecting all 

of the insurer’s statutory contract and constitutional claims for payment on november 18 2016 hhs issued a memorandum indicating a significant funding shortfall for the 2015 coverage year the second consecutive year of significant shortfalls given the successful challenge of the risk corridor provisions in court congressional inquiries into the funding of the risk corridor program and significant funding shortfalls under the first two years of the program during the fourth quarter of 2016 we wroteoff   583 million  in risk corridor receivables outstanding as of september 30 2016 including   415 million   associated with the 2014 and 2015 coverage years from inception of the risk corridor program through december 31 2016 we collected approximately 36 million  from cms for risk corridor receivables associated with the 2014 coverage year funded by hhs in accordance with previous guidance utilizing funds hhs collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 and 2015 risk corridor program  the remaining net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was approximately 456 million  at december 31 2016  including the 54 million  related to the 2015  coverage year as compared to 982 million  at december 31 2015  any amounts receivable or payable associated with these risk limiting programs may have an impact on subsidiary liquidity with any temporary shortfalls funded by the parent company 

for additional information on our liquidity risk please refer to item 1a – risk factors in this 2016  form 10k 

cash and cash equivalents increased  to 39 billion  at december 31 2016  from 26 billion  at december 31 2015  the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in the timing of working capital items earnings and enrollment activity as discussed below the increase in operating cash flows in 2016  primarily was due to significantly favorable working capital items and higher earnings exclusive of the commercial risk corridor receivables writeoff and the longterm care reserve strengthening in 2016 as well as the gain on sale of concentra and the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve in 2015 discussed previously the working capital changes yearoveryear primarily reflect lower income tax payments changes in the net receivable balance associated with the premium stabilization programs established under health care reform or the 3rs and the timing of payroll cycles resulting in one less payroll cycle in 2016 partially offset by the timing of payments for benefits expense  the lower operating cash flows in 2015 primarily reflect the effect of significant growth in individual commercial medical and group medicare advantage membership in 2014 and changes in the timing of working capital items related to the growth in our pharmacy business 

the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



 the decrease  in benefits payable in 2016  largely was due to a decrease  in ibnr discussed further below as well as the application of 2016  results to the premium deficiency reserve liability recognized in 2015 associated with our individual commercial medical products compliant with the health care reform law for the 2016 coverage year there was no premium deficiency reserve liability at december 31 2016 the increases in benefits payable in 2015  and 2014  largely were due to increases in ibnr as well as an increase  in the amount of processed but unpaid claims due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuates due to monthend cutoff these items were partially offset by a decrease in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements in both 2015 and 2014 including the disbursement of a portion of our medicare risk adjustment collections under our contractual obligations associated with our risk sharing arrangements in addition benefits payable in 2015  reflects the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve discussed previously 

ibnr decreased during 2016  primarily due to declines in group medicare advantage individual commercial medical and fullyinsured commercial group medical membership in 2016 ibnr increased during 2015 primarily as a result of individual medicare advantage membership growth while during 2014 ibnr also increased as a result of individual medicare advantage membership growth as well as significant growth in individual commercial medical and group medicare advantage membership as discussed previously our cash flows are impacted by changes in enrollment in 2014 the first year plans compliant with the health care reform law were effective membership in new fullyinsured individual commercial medical plans compliant with the health care reform law grew as compared with much lower growth in membership in these plans in 2015 and a decline in membership in these plans in 2016 similarly growth in group medicare advantage membership in 2014 favorably impacted the 2014 cash flows while a decline in group medicare advantage membership in 2015 and more significantly in 2016 negatively impacted the 2015 and 2016 cash flows 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



as disclosed previously on june 1 2015 we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary concentra net receivables associated with concentra were classified as heldforsale at december 31 2014 excluded from the table above for comparative purposes 

medicare receivables are impacted by changes in revenue associated with individual and group medicare membership changes as well as the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the increases in commercial and other receivables in 2016  as compared to 2015  primarily reflects an increase in our receivable associated with the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law similarly excluding the effect of classifying concentra receivables as heldforsale at december 31 2014 the increase in commercial and other receivables in 2014   primarily was due to the commercial risk adjustment provisions of the health care reform law which became effective in 2014 

military services receivables at december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our current tricare south region contract 

many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014 including the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions as well as the nondeductible health insurance industry fee as discussed previously the timing of payments and receipts associated with these provisions impact our operating cash flows as we build receivables for each coverage year that are expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years during 2016 net collections under the 3rs associated with prior coverage years were   383 million  as compared to net collections of 417 million  in 2015  there were no amounts collected in 2014 the first year of the programs the net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was approximately 456 million  at december 31 2016  including certain amounts recorded in receivables as noted above in 2016  we paid the federal government 916 million  for the annual health insurance industry fee compared to our payments of 867 million  in 2015  and  562 million  in 2014  

in addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense receipts for premiums and services revenues and amounts due under the risk limiting and health insurance industry fee provisions of the health care reform law other items impacting operating cash flows include income tax payments and the timing of payroll cycles resulting in one less payroll cycle in 2016 than in 2015 

cash flow from investing activities 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 527 million  in 2016  523 million  in 2015  and 528 million  in 2014  

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling   828 million  in 2016  proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities exceeded purchases by   103 million  in 2015  and 411 million  in 2014  these net proceeds were used to fund normal working capital needs due to an increase in receivables associated with the 3rs in addition to the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d reinsurance subsidies as discussed below 

in 2015 we purchased a 284 million   note receivable directly from a thirdparty bank syndicate related to the financing of mcci holdings llcs business as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data the purchase of this note is included with purchases of investment securities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 

on june 1 2015 we completed the sale of concentra for approximately 1055 million  in cash excluding approximately 22 million  of transaction costs 

cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 7 million  in 2016  38 million  in 2015  and 18 million  in 2014  acquisitions in each year included health and wellness related acquisitions 

cash flow from financing activities 

our financing cash flows are significantly impacted by the timing of claims payments and the related receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9  months after the close of each calendar year receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were   11 billion   higher than claims payments  during 2016  conversely claims payments were 361 million  higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claims subsidies for which we do not assume risk during 2015  and 945 million  higher during 2014  in 2014 and 2015 we experienced higher specialty prescription drug costs associated with a new treatment for hepatitis c than were contemplated in our bids which resulted in higher subsidy receivable balances in those years that were settled in 2015 and 2016 respectively under the terms of our contracts with cms our net receivable for cms subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was 09 billion  at december 31 2016  compared to 20 billion  at december 31 2015  refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

under our administrative services only tricare south region contract health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government  by 25 million  in 2016  and by 4 million  in 2015  reimbursements from the federal government equaled health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk in 2014  

claims payments associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were   higher than reimbursements from hhs  by 28 million  in 2016  and less than reimbursements by 69 million  in 2015  and by 26 million  in 2014  see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

we repurchased 185 million  shares for 329 million  in 2015  and 57 million  shares for 730 million  in 2014 excludes another 100 million held back pending final settlement of an accelerated stock repurchase plan in march 2015 under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors we did not repurchase shares in 2016 due to restrictions under the merger agreement we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 104 million  in 2016  56 million  in 2015  and 42 million  in 2014  

as discussed further below we paid dividends to stockholders of 177 million  in 2016  and 172 million  in each of 2015  and 2014  

we entered into a commercial paper program in october 2014 net repayments of commercial paper were 2 million  in 2016  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2016  was 475 million  net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 298 million  in 2015  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2015  was 414 million  there were no net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper in 2014  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2014  was 175 million  

in september 2014 we issued 400 million of 2625 senior notes due october 1 2019 600 million of 385 senior notes due october 1 2024 and 750 million of 495 senior notes due october 1 2044 our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses were 173 billion  we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem our 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2016  2015  and 2014  primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2016  was a  according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3  according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 2 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 8 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry humana inc our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company 

increased to 20 billion  at december 31 2016  from 16 billion  at december 31 2015  this increase primarily reflects operating cash derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries profits partially offset by capital expenditures payment of stockholder dividends and common stock repurchases our use of operating cash derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by departments of insurance or comparable state regulatory agencies our regulated subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of 763 million  in 2016  493 million  in 2015  and 927 million  in 2014  subsidiary dividends in 2015 reflect the impact of losses for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law and the november 5 2015 revised statutory accounting guidance requiring the exclusion of risk corridor receivables from related statutory surplus refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i  parent company financial information excluding puerto rico subsidiaries the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in   2017   is approximately   850 million  in the aggregate actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix

under state guaranty assessment laws including those related to state cooperative failures in the industry we may be assessed up to prescribed limits for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or lines of business as we do penn treaty is a financially distressed unaffiliated longterm care insurance company a final court ruling on penn treatys insolvency would trigger a guarantee fund assessment that would result in expense for us based on current information estimated at approximately 30 million 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards for further discussion of our reserving methodology including our use of completion and claims per member per month trend factors to estimate ibnr refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2016  data 



 the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for retail and group segment tables including information about incurred and paid claims development as of december 31 2016  net of reinsurance as well as cumulative claim frequency and the total of ibnr included within the net incurred claims amounts 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 582 million  in 2016  236 million  in 2015  and 518 million  in 2014  the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2016  2015  and 2014  



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2016  2015  and 2014  primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions our favorable development for each of the years presented above is discussed further in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2016  estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

benefits expense excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized a premium deficiency reserve for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law associated with the 2016 coverage year as discussed in more detail in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

military services benefits expense for each year in the table above reflect expenses associated with our contracts with the veterans administration 

the higher benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable during 2016 primarily relates to reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 kmg america corporation or kmg acquisition more fully described  below and in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data certain health policies sold to individuals prior to 2014 the first year plans compliant with the health care reform law were effective are accounted for as longduration as more fully described below  the decrease in benefits expense associated with future policy benefits payable in 2015 primarily reflects the release of reserves as individual commercial medical members transitioned to plans compliant with the health care reform law 

future policy benefits payable of 28 billion  and 22 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care insurance life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on premium rate increase interest rate mortality morbidity persistency the percentage of policies remaining inforce and maintenance expense assumptions interest rates are based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business mortality a measure of expected death and morbidity a measure of health status assumptions are based on published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is issued and only change if our expected future experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs ie the loss recognition date because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative we perform loss recognition tests at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the level of the liability together with the present 

value of future gross premiums may not be adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs 

future policy benefits payable include 22 billion  at december 31 2016  and   15 billion  at december 31 2015   associated with a nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 acquisition of kmg  approximately 30800  policies remain in force as of december 31 2016  no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block future policy benefits payable includes amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income for an additional liability that would exist on our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies if unrealized gains on the sale of the investments backing such products had been realized and the proceeds reinvested at then current yields there was a 77 million  additional liability at december 31 2016  and no additional liability at december 31   2015  amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income are net of applicable deferred taxes 

longterm care insurance policies provide nursing home and home health coverage for which premiums are collected many years in advance of benefits paid if any therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligation under long term care policies because the long duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets further we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold to the extent premium rate increases interest rates andor loss experience vary from our loss recognition date assumptions future material adjustments to reserves could be required 

during 2016 we recorded a loss for a premium deficiency the premium deficiency was based on current and anticipated experience that had deteriorated from our lockedin assumptions from the previous december 31 2013 loss recognition date particularly as they related to emerging experience indicating longer claims duration a prolonged lower interest rate environment and an increase in policyholder life expectancies based on this deterioration we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our closed block of longterm care insurance policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits and maintenance costs under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during 2016 we recorded 505 million  of additional benefits expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 659 million  partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 154 million  included in other longterm assets   

for our closed block of longterm care policies actuarial assumptions used to estimate reserves are inherently uncertain due to the potential changes in trends in mortality morbidity persistency and interest rates as well as premium rate increases as a result our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if these trends develop adversely to our expectations the estimated increase in reserves and additional benefit expense from hypothetically modeling adverse variations in our actuarial assumptions in the aggregate could be up to 250 million  net of reinsurance although such hypothetical revisions are not currently appropriate we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectation of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur and any such revision could be material generally accepted accounting principles do not allow us to unlock our assumptions for favorable items 

in addition future policy benefits payable includes amounts of 201 million  at december 31 2016  205 million  at december 31 2015  and 210 million  at december 31 2014  which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per employee basis for each month of coverage based on the type of coverage purchased single to family coverage options our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premiums revenue and administrative services only or aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay and for estimated rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from for our medicare and individual commercial medical products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage or ma plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all ma plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to ma plans rates paid to ma plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims cms is phasingin the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the risk adjustment processing system or raps to diagnosis data from the encounter data system or eds the raps process requires ma plans to apply a filter logic based on cms guidelines and only submit those claims that pass the filtering logic for submissions through eds cms requires ma plans to submit all the claims data and cms will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk adjustment data used to calculate risk scores for 2016 10 of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through eds increasing to 25 of the risk score calculated from claims data through eds for 2017 the phasein from raps to eds could result in different risk scores from each dataset as a result of plan processing issues cms processing issues or filtering logic differences between raps and eds and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows  we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model including cms changes to the submission process is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 98 billion  or 39  of total assets at december 31 2016  and 91 billion  or 37  of total assets at december 31 2015  debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2016  and 2015  the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2016  and 2015  



approximately 98  of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa  by sp at december 31 2016  most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb  the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 276 million  at december 31 2016  and 178 million  at december 31 2015  these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established taxexempt municipal securities that were not prerefunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of us states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds general obligation bonds which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer accounted for 14 billion  of these municipals in the portfolio special revenue bonds issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education and supported by the revenues of that project accounted for 16 billion  of these municipals our general obligation bonds are diversified across the us with no individual state exceeding 11  in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our taxexempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 132 million  and 173 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively of taxexempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent weighted average sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa  

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was less than 1 million  at december 31 2016  and 1 million  at december 31 2015  there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 23  at december 31 2016  and 25  at december 31 2015  

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2016  



under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

the recoverability of our nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities is supported by factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements these residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities at december 31 2016  primarily were composed of senior tranches having high 

credit support with over 99  of the collateral consisting of prime loans the weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgagebacked securities was aa  at december 31 2016  

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2016  remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets than when the securities were purchased at december 31 2016  we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2016  there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2016  2015  or 2014  

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2016  goodwill and other longlived assets represented 20  of total assets and 47  of total stockholders’ equity compared to 20  and 48  respectively at december 31 2015  

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition the carrying amount of goodwill for our reportable segments has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the 2015 segment change discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we use a twostep process to review goodwill for impairment the first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law or changes in government rates the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill with the exception of our provider services reporting unit in our healthcare services segment the provider services reporting unit would decline to less than 10 margin after factoring in a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense prior to 2009 under interest rate swap agreements we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements in 2008 we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2016  or december 31 2015  

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa  at december 31 2016  our net unrealized position decreased   120 million  from a net unrealized gain position of 92 million  at december 31 2015  to a net unrealized loss position of 28 million  at december 31 2016  at december 31 2016  we had gross unrealized losses of 196 million  on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2016  while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 44 years  as of december 31 2016  and 41 years  as of december 31 2015  based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 590 million  

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2016  and 2015  our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once  have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points two  times and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven  times

health care reform 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee and a threeyear industry wide commercial reinsurance fee the health care reform law is discussed more fully in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health care reform” in this 2015 form 10k 

business segments 

on january 1 2015 we realigned certain of our businesses among our reportable segments to correspond with internal management reporting changes and renamed our employer group segment to the group segment our three reportable segments remain retail group and healthcare services the more significant realignments included reclassifying medicare benefits offered to groups to the retail segment from the group segment bringing all of our medicare offerings which are now managed collectively together in one segment recognizing that in some instances we market directly to individuals that are part of a group medicare account in addition we realigned our military services business primarily consisting of our tricare south region contract previously included in the other businesses category to our group segment as we consider this contract with the government to be a group account prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2015 presentation  see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data in this 2015 form 10k for segment financial information 

we manage our business with three  reportable segments retail group and healthcare services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos generally require a referral from the member’s primary care provider before seeing certain specialty physicians preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy solutions provider home based and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2015  



medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

at december 31 2015  we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 2753400  individual medicare advantage members including approximately 587400  members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 78 billion  which represented approximately 263  of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 145  of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2016  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2016  have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp offering cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “medicare part d provisions” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2016  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2016  have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

group medicare advantage and medicare standalone pdp 

we offer products that enable employers that provide postretirement health care benefits to replace medicare wrap or medicare supplement products with medicare advantage or standalone pdps from humana these products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s postretirement benefit structure

medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries or dual eligibles the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of medicaid and medicare costs there were approximately 102 million  dual eligible individuals in the united states in 2015  trending upward due to medicaid eligibility expansions and individuals aging into the medicare program since the enactment of the health care reform law states are pursuing standalone dual eligible cms demonstration programs in which medicare medicaid and ltss benefits are more tightly integrated eligibility for participation in these standalone dual eligible demonstration programs may require statebased contractual relationships in existing medicaid programs 

we have contracts to serve medicaid eligible members in florida under the tanf and ltss programs our contracts in virginia and illinois serve members under each state’s standalone dual eligible demonstration program in addition in illinois we have an integrated care program or icp medicaid contract our kentucky medicaid contract is subject to a 100 coinsurance contract with caresource management group company ceding all the risk to caresource

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2015  by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

automatic reductions to the federal budget known as sequestration took effect on april 1 2013 including aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year due to the uncertainty around the application of these reductions there can be no assurances that we can completely offset any reductions to the medicare healthcare programs see “legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters” in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per 

member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2015  approximately 1100000  members or 77  of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts including 863000  individual medicare advantage members or 313  of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 196600  hmo members including 172000  individual medicare advantage members or 199  of the 863000  individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2015  with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 768 million  or 17  of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2015  we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and urac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo additionally all products sold on the federal and state marketplaces are required to be accredited certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in most of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos markets with enough history and membership and for many of our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2015  we employed approximately 1600  sales representatives as well as approximately 1400  telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products in our retail segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we have a marketing arrangement with walmart stores inc or walmart for our individual medicare standalone pdp offering we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers in addition we market our medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our group segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members in addition we have begun to offer plans to employer groups through private exchanges employers can give their employees a set amount of money and then direct them to a private exchange there employees can shop for a health plan and other benefits based on what the employer has selected as options we use licensed independent brokers independent agents and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products 

underwriting 

beginning in 2014 the health care reform law requires all individual and certain group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly newly issued individual and certain group health plans are not subject to underwriting in 2014 and beyond further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

prior to 2014 through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determined the risk we were willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups had to meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have a larger membership base andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2015  form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a – risk factors in this 2015  form 10k 

certain other services 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing billingenrollment and customer service through intercompany service agreements approved if required by state regulatory authorities humana inc our parent company charges a management fee for reimbursement of certain centralized services provided to its subsidiaries 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 50100  employees and approximately 1600  additional medical professionals working under management agreements primarily between us and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 




 item 1a risk factors 

risks relating to the merger with aetna 

  

the merger with aetna is subject to various closing conditions including governmental and regulatory approvals as well as other uncertainties and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed 

on july 2 2015 we entered into an agreement and plan of merger which we refer to as the “merger agreement” with aetna inc or “aetna” echo merger sub inc or “sub 1” and echo merger sub llc or “sub 2” each a wholly owned subsidiary of aetna under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement sub 1 will merge with and into us the “merger” in the merger each outstanding share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive i 08375 of a share of aetna common stock and ii 125 in cash without interest subject to any required withholding taxes immediately after the merger we as the surviving corporation in the merger will be merged with and into sub 2 with sub 2 remaining as the surviving entity of that merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of aetna to be renamed humana llc the merger is expected to close in the second half of 2016 

on october 19 2015 at separate meetings our stockholders approved the adoption of the merger agreement and aetna’s shareholders approved the issuance of aetna common stock in the merger consummation of the merger remains subject to other customary closing conditions however a number of which are not within our or aetna’s control and it is possible that such conditions may prevent delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the merger these conditions include among other things i the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and the receipt of necessary approvals under state insurance and healthcare laws and regulations and pursuant to certain licenses of certain of humana’s subsidiaries ii the absence of legal restraints and prohibitions on the consummation of the merger iii listing of the aetna common stock to be issued in the merger on the new york stock exchange iv subject to the relevant standards set forth in the merger agreement the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by each party v material compliance by each party with its covenants in the merger agreement and vi no “company material adverse effect” with respect to us and no “parent material adverse effect” with respect to aetna in each case since the execution of and as defined in the merger agreement in addition aetna’s obligation to consummate the merger is subject to a the condition that the required regulatory approvals do not impose any condition that individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a “regulatory material adverse effect” as such term is defined in the merger agreement and b cms has not imposed any sanctions with respect to our medicare advantage business that individually or in the aggregate is or would reasonably be expected to be material and adverse to us and its subsidiaries taken as a whole we cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise 

if the merger does not receive or timely receive the required regulatory approvals and clearances or if any regulatory agencies impose certain conditions relating to the required regulatory approvals that would reasonably be expected to have a regulatory material adverse effect or if an event occurs that delays or prevents the merger such failure or delay to complete the merger may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position cash flows and the price per share for our common stock 

the merger agreement prohibits us from pursuing alternative transactions to the merger 

following the receipt of approval by our stockholders and aetnas shareholders with respect to the aetna stock to be issued in the transaction on october 19 2015 the merger agreement is binding on the parties subject to customary closing conditions the merger agreement prohibits us from initiating soliciting knowingly encouraging knowingly facilitating or entering into discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding alternative acquisition proposals this provision prevents us from affirmatively seeking offers from other possible acquirers that may be superior to the pending merger we do not have the ability to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal since our stockholders have voted to approve the adoption of the merger agreement 

the number of shares of aetna common stock that our stockholders will receive in the merger is based on a fixed exchange ratio because the market price of aetna’s common stock will fluctuate our stockholders cannot be certain of the value of the portion of the merger consideration to be paid in aetna common stock 

upon completion of the merger each outstanding share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive i 08375 of a share of aetna common stock and ii 125 in cash without interest subject to any required withholding taxes the exchange ratio for determining the number of shares of aetna common stock that our stockholders will receive in the merger is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of aetna’s common stock which will likely fluctuate before and after the completion of the merger fluctuations in the value of aetna’s common stock could result from changes in the business operations or prospects of aetna prior to or following the closing of the merger regulatory considerations general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of us or aetna 

while the merger is pending we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows or result in a loss of employees customers members or suppliers 

the merger agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion or termination of the merger generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent aetna’s prior written consent we may find that these and other contractual restrictions in the merger agreement may delay or prevent us from responding or limit our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period even if our management believes they may be advisable the pendency of the merger may also divert management’s attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations 

 our employees customers members and suppliers may experience uncertainties about the effects of the merger in connection with the pending merger it is possible that some customers members suppliers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the merger similarly current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the merger which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees if any of these effects were to occur it could materially and adversely impact our results of operations financial position cash flows and the price per share for our common stock 

failure to consummate the merger could negatively impact our results of operations financial position cash flows and the price per share for our common stock 

if the merger is not consummated our ongoing businesses may be materially and adversely affected and we will not have realized any of the potential benefits of having consummated the transaction and we will be subject to a number of risks including the following 

 18 

 if the merger is not consummated these risks may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position cash flows and the price per share for our common stock 

risks relating to our business 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns we continually review these estimates however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends any reserve including a premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including longterm care life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental insurance policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from the assumptions we have locked in additional future adjustments to reserves could be required 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts participation in health insurance exchanges and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments under the health care reform law and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we may also face increased competition due to participation by other insurers in the health insurance exchanges implemented under the health care reform law we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare military medicaid and health insurance exchange programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our statebased contracts strategy and our participation in the new health insurance exchanges our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs and our participation in health insurance exchanges 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we offer both standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plans with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer a medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 72  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  generated from our medicare products including 14  derived from our individual medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

the recently implemented health care reform law created a federal medicaremedicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles this medicaremedicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of care between medicare and medicaid depending upon the results of those demonstration projects cms may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives to address the dual eligibles opportunity including our participation in statebased contracts or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members our business may be materially adversely affected 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial products including participation in certain health insurance exchanges introduction of new products and benefit designs including humanavitality and other wellness products growth of our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products the adoption of new technologies development of adjacent businesses and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives including implementing our integrated care delivery model that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have reduced the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

there can be no assurance that our information technology or it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems successfully could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders 

the costs to eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

our business may be materially adversely impacted by the adoption of a new coding set for diagnoses 

federal regulations related to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended hipaa contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information on october 1 2015 icd10 the current system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the united states replaced the prior set of codes for dates of service on or after october 1 2015 health plans and providers are required to use icd10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures while we prepared for the transition to icd10 if unforeseen circumstances arise it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if some providers continue to use icd9 codes on claims after october 1 2015 including providers in our network who are employees we will have to reject such claims which may lead to claim resubmissions increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction further providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in increased claim submissions or lost revenues under risk adjustment during the transition to icd10 certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner if we do not adequately implement the new icd10 coding set or if providers in our network do not adequately transition to the new icd10 coding set our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims stockholder suits and other securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 23 

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 73  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  these programs involve various risks as described further below 

 24 

premiums and services revenue associated with the tricare south region contract accounted for approximately 1  of our total premiums and services revenue on april 1 2012 we began delivering services under the current tricare south region contract that the defense health agency or dha formerly known as the tricare management activity awarded to us on february 25 2011 the current 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2017 is subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year during its term at the government’s option on january 22 2016 we received notice from the dha of its intent to exercise its option to extend the tricare south region contract through march 31 2017 the loss of the tricare south region contract should it occur may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans   

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provides that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire ma contract based upon a comparison to “benchmark” audit data in medicare ffs which we refer to as the ffs adjuster this comparison to the ffs adjuster is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of audit results because the government program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set provides the basis for ma plans’ risk adjustment to payment rates cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the government program data set 

the final methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to radv contract level audits currently being conducted for contract year 2011 in which two of our medicare advantage plans are being audited per cms guidance selected ma contracts will be notified of an audit at some point after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited the final reconciliation occurs in august of the calendar year following the payment year we were notified on september 15 2015 that five of our medicare advantage contracts have been selected for audit for contract year 2012 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feeforservice business which we used to represent a proxy of the ffs adjuster which has not yet been released we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for each contract year on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows however as indicated we are awaiting additional guidance from cms regarding the ffs adjuster accordingly we cannot determine whether such radv audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in addition cms comments in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to ma plans appear to be inconsistent with cms prior radv audit guidance these statements contained in the preamble to cms’ final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above we will continue to work with cms to ensure that ma plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 22 million  at december 31 2015  

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes 

we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets   increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry the provisions of the health care reform law include among others imposing a significant new nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health care reform law also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled 

with programs designed to spread risk among insurers subject to federal administrative action and expands eligibility for medicaid programs subject to statebystate implementation of this expansion in addition the health care reform law has increased and will continue to increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected for additional information please refer to the section entitled “health care reform” in “item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” appearing in this annual report 

 our participation in the new federal and state health insurance exchanges which entail uncertainties associated with mix volume of business and the operation of premium stabilization programs which are subject to federal administrative action could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the health care reform law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective january 1 2014 with an annual open enrollment period insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges must offer a minimum level of benefits and are subject to guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations we may be adversely selected by individuals who have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in this market in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the health care reform law established to apportion risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our products during 2015 we received our interim settlement associated with our risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year the interim settlement representing only 126  of risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year was funded by hhs in accordance with previous guidance utilizing funds hhs collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 risk corridor program   hhs provided guidance under the three year risk corridor program that future collections will first be applied to any shortfalls from previous coverage years before application to current year obligations risk corridor payables to issuers are obligations of the united states government under the health care reform law which requires the secretary of hhs to make full payments to issuers in the event of a shortfall at the end of the three year program hhs has asserted it will explore other sources of funding for risk corridor payments subject to the availability of appropriations  in addition regulatory changes to the implementation of the health care reform law that allowed individuals to remain in plans that are not compliant with the health care reform law or to enroll outside of the annual enrollment period may have an adverse effect on our pool of participants in the health insurance exchange all of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows if our premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions used in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application including reductions in medicare advantage payment rates could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to the health care reform law the health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes 

administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa among other requirements the hitech act and hipaa mandate individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to the us department of health and human services in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires the us department of health and human services to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including capital adequacy and other licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives the divestiture of certain businesses could result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestitures on terms favorable to us 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract 

is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy mail order business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance   

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

business segments 

on january 1 2015 we realigned certain of our businesses among our reportable segments to correspond with internal management reporting changes and renamed our employer group segment to the group segment our three reportable segments remain retail group and healthcare services the more significant realignments included reclassifying medicare benefits offered to groups to the retail segment from the group segment bringing all of our medicare offerings which are now managed collectively together in one segment recognizing that in some instances we market directly to individuals that are part of a group medicare account in addition we realigned our military services business primarily consisting of our tricare south region contract previously included in the other businesses category to our group segment as we consider this contract with the government to be a group account prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2015 presentation    this is further described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

we manage our business with three  reportable segments retail group and healthcare services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources   

the retail segment consists of medicare benefits marketed to individuals or directly via group accounts as well as individual commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products in addition the retail segment also includes our contract with cms to administer the linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible and longterm support services benefits collectively our statebased contracts the group segment consists of employer group commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and voluntary insurance benefits as well as administrative services only or aso products in addition our group segment includes our health and wellness products primarily marketed to employer groups and military services business primarily our tricare south region contract the healthcare services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions provider services home based services and clinical programs as well as services and capabilities to advance population health we will continue to report under the category of other businesses those businesses which do not align with the reportable segments described above primarily our closedblock longterm care insurance policies   

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and home based services as well as clinical programs to our retail and group customers  intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often use the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at a corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and are included with intersegment eliminations  

seasonality 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

our group segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the group segment’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses similarly certain of our fullyinsured individual commercial medical products in our retail segment experience seasonality in the benefit ratio akin to the group segment including the effect of existing previously underwritten members transitioning to policies compliant with the health care reform law with us and other carriers as previously underwritten members transition it results in policy lapses and the release of reserves for future policy benefits partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred acquisition costs these policy lapses generally occur during the first quarter of the new coverage year following the open enrollment period reducing the benefit ratio in the first quarter the recognition of a premium deficiency reserve for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law in the fourth quarter of 2015 discussed in more detail in the highlights that follow negatively impacted the benefit ratio pattern in 2015 and conversely is expected to favorably impact the benefit ratio in 2016 for this business the quarterly benefit ratio pattern for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law will be relatively flat throughout 2016 as opposed to the increasing benefit ratio pattern exhibited in prior years 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare and individual health care exchange marketing seasons

risk coding modifications and other funding formula changes indicated 2016 medicare advantage funding increases for us of approximately 10 on average although the overall rate adjustment is positive geographicspecific impacts may vary significantly from this average particularly in florida we believe we have effectively designed medicare advantage products based upon the applicable level of rate changes while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original medicare with a supplement policy and medicare advantage products offered by our competitors failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 we took a number of actions in 2015 to improve the profitability of our individual commercial medical business in 2016 these actions were subject to regulatory restrictions in certain geographies and included premium increases for the 2016 coverage year related generally to the first half of 2015 claims experience the discontinuation of certain products as well as exit of certain markets for 2016 network improvements enhancements to claims and clinical processes and administrative cost control despite these actions the deterioration in the second half of 2015 claims experience together with 2016 open enrollment results indicating the retention of many highutilizing members for 2016 resulted in a probable future loss as a result of our assessment of the profitability of our individual medical policies compliant with the health care reform law in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a provision for probable future losses premium deficiency reserve for the 2016 coverage year of 176 million  or 074  per diluted common share the premium deficiency reserve includes the estimated benefit of approximately 340 million  associated with risk corridor provisions expected for the 2016 coverage year   

in light of the premium deficiency reserve recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015 for the 2016 coverage year results for this business for 2016 are expected to primarily include results associated with the winddown of plans that are not compliant with the health care reform law including the related release of policy reserves as well as indirect administrative costs associated with plans that are compliant with the health care reform law we are continuing to evaluate our participation in the individual commercial medical line of business for 2017 

 we expect a net decline in individual commercial medical membership excluding medicare supplement for full year 2016  of 200000 to 300000 primarily reflecting increases in premiums as well as benefit redesigns that took effect on january 1 2016 this membership expectation takes into account plans compliant with the health care reform law both on and off exchange and legacy plans that are not compliant with the health care reform law membership estimates for 2016 include the expectation of coverage termination by 50 to 60 of the approximately 100000 members impacted by plan discontinuances

 health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and the introduction of plan designs based on set actuarial values in addition the health care reform law established insurance industry assessments including an annual health insurance industry fee and a threeyear 25 billion industry wide commercial reinsurance fee the annual health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry was 8 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter and is not deductible for income tax purposes which significantly increased our effective income tax rate our effective tax rate for 2015  was approximately 475  including the favorable impact of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 our effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be approximately 49  to 51  excluding the impact of transaction costs associated with the merger in 2015  we paid the federal government 867 million  for the annual health insurance industry fee a 543  increase from 562 million  in 2014  primarily reflecting an increase in the total industry fee we expect our portion of the annual health insurance industry fee for 2016 to be higher than in 2015 given growth in our market share the consolidated appropriations act 2016 enacted on december 18 2015 included a onetime one year suspension in 2017 of the health insurer fee   this will significantly reduce our effective tax rate in 2017  the health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry was previously expected to be 14 billion in 2017 

in addition the health care reform law expands federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms comes in part from material additional fees and taxes on us as discussed above and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described in this 2015 10k 

as noted above the health care reform law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective january 1 2014 with an annual open enrollment period insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges must offer a minimum level of benefits and are subject to guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations we may be adversely selected by individuals who have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in this market in addition the risk 

corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the health care reform law established to apportion risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our products in addition regulatory changes to the implementation of the health care reform law that allowed individuals to remain in plans that are not compliant with the health care reform law or to enroll outside of the annual enrollment period may have an adverse effect on our pool of participants in the health insurance exchange in addition states may impose restrictions on our ability to increase rates all of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows if our premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions used in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows and could impact our decision to participate or continue in the program in certain states 

as discussed above it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as future legislative changes including legislative restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or regulatory restrictions on profitability including by comparison of our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability and a requirement that they remain within certain ranges of each other in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows including the delayed receipt of amounts due under the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law during 2015 we received our interim settlement associated with our risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year the interim settlement representing only 126  of risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year was funded by hhs in accordance with previous guidance utilizing funds hhs collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 risk corridor program  the risk corridor program is a three year program and hhs guidance provides that risk corridor collections over the life of the three year program will first be applied to any shortfalls from previous benefit years before application to current year obligations risk corridor payables to issuers are obligations of the united states government under the health care reform law which requires the secretary of hhs to make full payments to issuers in the event of a shortfall at the end of the three year program hhs has asserted it will explore other sources of funding for risk corridor payments subject to the availability of appropriations   

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and home based services as well as clinical programs to our retail and group customers  and are described in note 17   to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this 2015 10k 

comparison of results of operations for 2015  and 2014   

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  

consolidated 



 summary 

net income was 13 billion  or 844  per diluted common share in 2015  compared to 11 billion  or 736  per diluted common share in 2014  the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 resulted in an aftertax gain 

of 157  per diluted common share in 2015 excluding the impact of the sale of concentra the decrease primarily was due to a decline in retail segment pretax results including expense of 074  per diluted common share for a premium deficiency reserve for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year and an increase in the effective tax rate as discussed below these items were partially offset by yearoveryear improvement in the group and healthcare services segment pretax results and higher investment income in addition 2015  includes expenses of 014  per diluted common share for transaction costs associated with the merger certain of which are not deductible for tax purposes net income for 2014 includes expenses of 015  per diluted common share associated with a loss on extinguishment of debt for the redemption of certain senior notes in 2014  yearoveryear comparisons of diluted earnings per common share are also favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per common share in 2015  reflecting the impact of share repurchases 

  premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased   65 billion  or 140  from 2014  to 524 billion  for 2015  primarily reflecting higher premiums in both the retail and group segments these higher premiums were primarily driven by average membership growth in the retail segment and an increase in fullyinsured group commercial medical per member premiums in the group segment average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue decreased   758 million  or 350  from 2014  to 14 billion  for 2015  primarily due to the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 as well as the loss of certain large group aso accounts as a result of continued discipline in pricing of services for selffunded accounts amid a highly competitive environment 

investment income 

investment income totaled 474 million  for 2015  an increase  of 97 million  or 257  from 2014  primarily due to higher realized capital gains in 2015 as a result of the repositioning of our portfolio given recent market volatility and anticipated changes to interest rates with higher average invested balances being substantially offset by lower interest rates 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 443 billion  for 2015  an increase  of 61 billion  or 160  from 2014  primarily due to an increase in the retail segment mainly driven by higher average medicare advantage membership and individual commercial medical onexchange and offexchange membership in plans compliant with the health care reform law as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 236 million  in 2015  and 518 million  in 2014  the decline in priorperiod medical claims reserve development year overyear primarily was due to medicare advantage and individual commercial medical claims development in the retail segment as discussed further in the segment results of operations discussion that follows 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2015  was 845  an increase  of 150  basis points from 2014  primarily due to increases in the retail segment including the impact of a recognizing a premium deficiency reserve for certain of our individual commercial medical products for the 2016 coverage year and group segment ratios as discussed in the segment results of operations discussions that follows the increase in benefits expense associated with the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve increased  the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 30  basis points in 2015  favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development decreased  the consolidated benefit ratio by approximately 50  basis points in 2015  versus approximately 110  basis points in 2014  

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs decreased   321 million  or 42  from 2014  to 73 billion  in 2015  primarily due to cost management initiatives across all lines of business as well as the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 partially offset by increases in costs mandated by the health care reform law including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2015  was 136  decreasing   230  basis points from 2014  primarily due to decreases in the operating cost ratios in the group and retail segments reflecting cost management initiatives as well as the completion of the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 concentra carried a higher operating cost ratio 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2015  totaled 355 million  increasing   22 million  or 66  from 2014  reflecting higher depreciation expense from capital expenditures 

interest expense 

interest expense was 186 million  for 2015  compared to 192 million  for 2014  a decrease  of 6 million  or 31  primarily reflecting a higher average longterm debt balance due to the issuance of senior notes in september 2014 partially offset by the recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 37 million in october 2014 for the redemption of our 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2016 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2015  was 475  compared to the effective tax rate of 472  in 2014  the increase in the effective tax rate primarily was due to an increase in the nondeductible health insurance industry fee from 2014  substantially offset by the favorable tax effect of the gain on the sale of concentra see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate our effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be approximately 49  to 51  excluding the impact of any nondeductible transaction costs associated with the merger

 we experienced higher than expected medical costs as compared to the assumptions used in our pricing for 2015 primarily due to lowerthanexpected 2015 medicare advantage financial claim recovery levels and lowerthananticipated reductions in inpatient admissions in addition medical claims associated with certain individual commercial medical products in particular products compliant with the health care reform law exceeded the assumptions used when we set pricing for 2015 we took a number of actions in 2015 to improve the profitability of our individual commercial medical business in 2016   these actions were subject to regulatory restrictions in certain geographies and included premium increases for the 2016 coverage year related generally to the first half of 2015 claims experience the discontinuation of certain products as well as exit of certain markets for 2016 network improvements enhancements to claims and clinical processes and 

administrative cost control despite these actions the deterioration in the second half of 2015 claims experience together with 2016 open enrollment results indicating the retention of many highutilizing members for 2016 resulted in a probable future loss as a result of our assessment of the profitability of our individual medical policies compliant with the health care reform law in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a provision for probable future losses premium deficiency reserve for the 2016 coverage year of 176 million  the increase in benefits expense associated with the recognition of the premium deficiency reserve increased  the retail segment benefit ratio by approximately 40  basis points in 2015

block of longterm care insurance policies included with other businesses as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data as well as the benefit of a reduction in benefits expense in 2013  related to a favorable settlement of contract claims with the dod excluding these items the increase in net income primarily resulted from higher pretax income in our healthcare services segment substantially offset by lower pretax income in our retail and group segments in addition 2014 was favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per common share reflecting the impact of share repurchases 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased   71 billion  or 184  from 2013  to 460 billion  for 2014  primarily due to increases in both retail and group segment premiums mainly driven by higher average individual and group medicare advantage membership as well as higher individual commercial medical membership in addition yearoveryear comparisons to 2013  were negatively impacted by sequestration which became effective april 1 2013 premiums revenue for our other businesses declined primarily due to the loss of our puerto rico medicaid contracts effective september 30 2013 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased   55 million  or 26  from 2013  to 22 billion  for 2014  primarily due to an increase in services revenue in our retail segment due to the acquisition of american eldercare in september 2013

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2014  was 830  a decrease  of 90  basis points from 2013  primarily due to reserve strengthening in 2013  associated with our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies included with other businesses as discussed above as well as the loss of our medicaid contracts in puerto rico effective september 30 2013 which more than offset higher ratios yearoveryear in the retail and group segments

liquidity 

the merger agreement includes customary restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger generally requiring us to conduct our business in the ordinary course and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent aetna’s prior written consent historically our primary sources of cash have included receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities borrowings and proceeds from sales of businesses our primary uses of cash historically have included disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including premiums receivable benefits payable and other receivables and payables our cash flows are impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d subsidies for which we do not assume risk the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements of state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of operating cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by state departments of insurance or comparable state regulators 

the effect of the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law impact the timing of our operating cash flows as we build receivables for each coverage year that are expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years on june 30 2015 we received notification from cms of risk adjustment and reinsurance settlement amounts for 2014 during 2015  we collected 392 million  net for risk adjustment and reinsurance recoverable settlements associated with the 2014 coverage year in addition during 2015  we received our interim settlement associated with our risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year the interim settlement representing only 126  of risk corridor receivables for the 2014 coverage year was funded by hhs in accordance with previous guidance utilizing funds hhs collected from us and other carriers under the 2014 risk corridor program  we collected 25 million  net of payments for risk corridor associated with the 2014 coverage year during 2015  hhs provided guidance under the three year risk corridor program that future collections will first be applied to any shortfalls from previous coverage years before application to current year obligations risk corridor payables to issuers are obligations of the united states government under the health care reform law which requires the secretary of hhs to make full payments to issuers in the event of a shortfall at the end of the three year program hhs has asserted it will explore other sources of funding for risk corridor payments subject to the availability of appropriations  the 

remaining net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was approximately 982 million  at december 31 2015  including 219 million  related to the 2014 coverage year and 679 million  at december 31 2014  any amounts receivable or payable associated with these risk limiting programs may have an impact on subsidiary liquidity with any temporary shortfalls funded by the parent company 

for additional information on our liquidity risk please refer to item 1a – risk factors in this 2015 form 10k 

cash and cash equivalents increased  to 26 billion  at december 31 2015  from 19 billion  at december 31 2014  the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings enrollment activity and the timing of working capital items as discussed below the lower operating cash flows in 2015  primarily reflect the effect of significant growth in individual commercial medical and group medicare advantage membership in 2014  and changes in the timing of working capital items related to the growth in our pharmacy business operating cash flows for 2014 were favorably impacted and conversely operating cash flows for 2015  were negatively impacted from the typical pattern of claim payments that lagged premium receipts related to new membership in 2014  individual commercial medical added 548000  new members in 2014 compared to a decline of 90400  members in 2015 likewise group medicare advantage added 60600  new members in 2014 compared to a decline of 5600  members in 2015 in addition 2015 and 2014 operating cash flows were impacted by increased receivables associated with the 3rs 

the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefits expense and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



 the increase s in benefits payable in 2015  and 2014  largely were due to an increase  in ibnr ibnr increased during 2015 primarily as a result of individual medicare advantage membership growth while during 2014 ibnr also increased as a result of individual medicare advantage membership growth as well as significant growth in individual commercial medical and group medicare advantage membership as discussed previously our cash flows are impacted by changes in enrollment in 2014  the first year plans compliant with the health care reform law were effective membership in new fullyinsured individual commercial medical plans compliant with the health care reform law grew as compared with a decline in membership in these plans in 2015  similarly growth in group medicare advantage membership in 2014  favorably impacted the 2014  cash flows while a decline in group medicare advantage membership in 2015  negatively impacted the 2015  cash flows 

in addition the increase  in benefits payable in 2015  reflects the recognition of a premium deficiency reserve associated with our individual commercial medical products compliant with the health care reform law for the 2016 coverage year an increase  in the amount of processed but unpaid claims due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuates due to monthend cutoff also contributed to the benefits payable increase in each of 2015  and 2014  these items were partially offset by a decrease in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements in both 2015  and 2014  including the disbursement of a portion of our medicare risk adjustment collections under our contractual obligations associated with our risk sharing arrangements the increase in benefits payable in 2013  primarily was due to an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims due to our pharmacy benefit administrator and an increase in ibnr primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



as disclosed previously on june 1 2015 we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary concentra net receivables associated with concentra were classified as heldforsale at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 and excluded from the table above for comparative purposes 

medicare receivables are impacted by revenue growth associated with growth in individual and group medicare membership and the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the increases in commercial and other receivables in each of 2015  2014  and 2013  primarily are due to growth in the business excluding the effect of classifying concentra receivables as heldforsale at december 31 2014 the increase in commercial and other receivables from 2013  to 2014  is primarily due to the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law which became effective in 2014 

military services receivables at december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our current tricare south region contract 

many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014 including the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions as well as the nondeductible health insurance industry fee as discussed previously the timing of payments and receipts associated with these provisions impact our operating cash flows as we build receivables for each coverage year that are expected to be collected in subsequent coverage years the net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was approximately 982 million  at december 31 2015  and 679 million  at december 31 2014  including certain amounts recorded in receivables as noted above in 2015  we paid the federal government 867 million  for the annual health insurance industry fee compared to our payment of 562 million  in 2014  

in addition to the timing of payments of benefits expense receipts for premiums and services revenues and amounts due under the risk limiting and health insurance industry fee provisions of the health care reform law other items impacting operating cash flows primarily resulted from the timing of working capital related to the growth in our pharmacy and payments for the medicare part d risk corridor provisions of our contracts with cms 

cash flow from investing activities 

on june 1 2015 we completed the sale of concentra for approximately 1055 million  in cash excluding approximately 22 million  of transaction costs 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 523 million  in 2015  528 million  in 2014  and 441 million  in 2013  

in 2015  we purchased a 284 million   note receivable directly from a thirdparty bank syndicate related to the financing of mcci holdings llcs business as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data the purchase of this note is included with purchases of investment securities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 

proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities exceeded purchases by   103 million  in 2015  and 411 million  in 2014  these net proceeds were used to fund normal working capital needs due to an increase in receivables associated with the 3rs in addition to the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d reinsurance subsidies as discussed below we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling   592 million  in 2013  

cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 38 million  in 2015  18 million  in 2014  and 187 million  in 2013  acquisitions in 2015  and 2014  included health and wellness related acquisitions cash paid for acquisitions in 2013  primarily related to the american eldercare and other health and wellness related acquisitions 

cash flow from financing activities 

claims payments were   361 million   higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk  during 2015  945 million higher during 2014 and 155 million higher during 2013 our 2014  financing cash flows were negatively impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk we experienced higher specialty prescription drug costs associated with a new treatment for hepatitis c than were contemplated in our bids which resulted in higher subsidy receivable balances in 2014  that were settled in 2015 under the terms of our contracts with cms our net receivable for cms subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was 20 billion  at december 31 2015  compared to 17 billion  at december 31 2014  refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

under our administrative services only tricare south region contract health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government  by 4 million  in 2015  and were less than reimbursements from the federal government by  5 million  in 2013  reimbursements from the federal government equaled health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk in 2014  receipts from hhs associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were   higher than claims payments  by 69 million  in 2015  and 26 million  in 2014  see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

we repurchased 19  million shares for 329 million  in 2015  57 million  shares for 730 million  in 2014  excludes another 100 million held back pending final settlement of an accelerated stock repurchase plan in march 2015 and 58 million  shares for 502 million  in 2013  under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 56 million  in 2015  42 million  in 2014  and 29 million  in 2013  

as discussed further below we paid dividends to stockholders of 172 million  in each of 2015  and 2014  and 168 million  in 2013  

we entered into a commercial paper program in october 2014 net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were 298 million   2015  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2015  was 414 million  there were no net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper in 2014  and the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during 2014  was 175 million 

in september 2014 we issued 400 million of 2625 senior notes due october 1 2019 600 million of 385 senior notes due october 1 2024 and 750 million of 495 senior notes due october 1 2044 our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses were 173 billion  we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem our 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2015  2014  and 2013  primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft 

future sources and uses of liquidity 

dividends 

the following table provides details of dividend payments excluding dividend equivalent rights in 2013  2014  and 2015  under our board approved quarterly cash dividend policy 



the merger discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data does not impact our ability and intent to continue quarterly dividend payments prior to the closing of the merger consistent with our historical dividend payments under the terms of the merger agreement we have agreed with aetna that our quarterly dividend will not exceed 029 per share prior to the closing of the merger  declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of our board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change in addition under the terms of the merger agreement we have agreed with aetna to coordinate the declaration and payment of dividends so that our stockholders do not fail to receive a quarterly dividend around the time of the closing of the merger   

on october 29 2015  the board declared a cash dividend of 029  per share that was paid on january 29 2016  to stockholders of record on december 30 2015  for an aggregate amount of 43 million  

stock repurchases 

in september 2014  our board of directors replaced a previous share repurchase authorization of up to 1 billion  of which 816 million  remained unused with a new current authorization for repurchases of up to 2 billion  of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans expiring on december 31 2016  under the share repurchase authorization shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases through plans designed to comply with rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or in privatelynegotiated transactions including pursuant to accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume pricing and timing pursuant to the merger agreement after july 2 2015 we are prohibited from repurchasing any of our outstanding securities without the prior written consent of aetna other than repurchases of shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting or settlement of outstanding restricted stock awards accordingly as announced on july 3 2015 we have suspended our share repurchase program our remaining repurchase authorization was   104 billion  as of july 3 2015   

senior notes 

in september 2014 we issued 400 million of 2625 senior notes due october 1 2019 600 million of 385 senior notes due october 1 2024 and 750 million of 495 senior notes due october 1 2044 our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses were 173 billion  we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem the 645  senior unsecured notes as discussed below we previously issued 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 that were redeemed in october 2014 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 300 million of 630 senior notes due august 1 2018 600 million of 315 senior notes due december 1 2022 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 and 400 million of 4625 senior notes due december 1 2042 

in october 2014 we redeemed the 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2016 at 100   of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  for cash totaling approximately 560 million  we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately 37 million  in october 2014 in connection with the redemption of these notes 

our senior notes which are unsecured may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified makewhole amount the 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded in addition each series of our senior notes other than the 630 senior notes contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances on july 2 2015 we entered into a merger agreement with aetna that when closed may require redemption of the notes if the notes are downgraded below investment grade by both standard  poor’s rating services or sp and moody’s investors services inc or moody’s 

credit agreement 

our   5 year   10 billion   unsecured revolving credit agreement expires july 2018 under the credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread the libor spread currently   110   basis points varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 90  to 150   basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently   15   basis points may fluctuate between   10  and 25   basis points depending upon our credit ratings the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option 

the terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds in addition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of 85 billion   at december 31 2015   and a maximum leverage ratio of 301  we are in compliance with the financial covenants with actual net worth of   103 billion   and an actual leverage ratio of 131  as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of december 31   2015  in addition the credit agreement includes an uncommitted 250 million  incremental loan facility 

at december 31 2015  we had no  borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement and we had outstanding letters of credit of 1 million  secured under the credit agreement  no amounts have been drawn on these letters of credit accordingly as of december 31 2015  we had 999 million  of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement   

commercial paper 

in october 2014 we entered into a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discount basis through certain broker dealers amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed from time to time with the aggregate face or principal amount outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed 1 billion  the net proceeds of issuances have been and are 

expected to be used for general corporate purposes the maximum principal amount outstanding at any one time during the year ended   december 31 2015 was 414 million  there was 299 million  outstanding at december 31 2015  

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2015  was bbb  according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3  according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 2 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 8 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry humana inc our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company increased to 16 billion  at december 31 2015  from 14 billion  at december 31 2014  this increase primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of concentra on june 1 2015 proceeds from issuance of commercial paper and subsidiary dividends to the parent company partially offset by funding of subsidiary working capital requirements common stock repurchases capital expenditures and payment of stockholder dividends our use of operating cash derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by departments of insurance our regulated subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of 493 million  in 2015  927 million  in 2014  and 967 million  in 2013  subsidiary dividends in 2015 reflect the impact of losses for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law and the november 5 2015 revised statutory accounting guidance requiring the exclusion of risk corridor receivables from related statutory surplus described below refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i  parent company financial information excluding puerto rico subsidiaries the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in   2016   is approximately   900 million  in the aggregate actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix 

on november 5 2015 the national association of insurance commissioners or naic issued statutory accounting guidance for receivables associated with the risk corridor provisions under the health care reform law which requires the receivables to be excluded from subsidiary surplus this accounting guidance required additional capital contributions into certain subsidiaries during 2015 this statutory accounting guidance does not affect our financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under which we have recorded a receivable for risk corridor amounts due to us as an obligation of the united states government under the health care reform law at december 31 2015 our gross risk corridor receivable for the 2014 and 2015 coverage years in the aggregate was 459 million  we expect to record a risk corridor receivable of approximately 340 million  in 2016 for the 2016 coverage year 

certain regulated subsidiaries recognized premium deficiency reserves for our individual commercial medical policies compliant with the health care reform law for the 2016 coverage year in the fourth quarter of 2015 further the statutorybased premium deficiency excludes the estimated benefit associated with the risk corridor provisions as a reduction in subsidiary surplus in accordance with the previously discussed november 5 2015 statutory accounting guidance requiring the exclusion of risk corridor amounts from subsidiary surplus as a result of the statutorybased premium deficiency we will fund capital contributions into certain regulated subsidiaries of 450 million during the first quarter of 2016   

in 2015 we paid the federal government 867 million  for the annual health insurance industry fee and expect to pay a higher amount in 2016 given an increase in market share the consolidated appropriations act 2016 enacted on december 18 2015 included a onetime one year suspension in 2017 of the health insurer fee

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies primarily related to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent two months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent two months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis 

based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing changes in medical management processes product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent two months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent two months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including recoveries of overpayments receipt cycle times claim inventory levels outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors claim payments to providers for services rendered are often net of overpayment recoveries for claims paid previously as contractually allowed claim overpayment recoveries can result from many different factors including retroactive enrollment activity audits of provider billings andor payment errors changes in patterns of claim overpayment recoveries can be unpredictable and result in completion factor volatility as they often impact older dates of service the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increases in electronic claim submissions from providers decrease the receipt cycle time if claims are submitted or processed on a faster slower pace than prior periods the actual claim may be more less complete than originally estimated using our completion factors which may result in reserves that are higher lower than required 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services new higher priced technologies and medical procedures and new prescription drugs and therapies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes the tort liability system increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population lifestyle changes including diet and smoking catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent two months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent two months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent two months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2015  data 



 the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 236 million  in 2015  518 million  in 2014  and 474 million  in 2013  the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2015  2014  and 2013  



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2015  2014  and 2013  primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the decline in favorable prior period development in 2015 primarily was due to the impact of lower financial claim recoveries due in part to our gradual implementation during 2014 of inpatient authorization review prior to admission as opposed to post adjudication as well as higher than expected flu associated claims from the fourth quarter of 2014 and continued volatility in claims associated with individual commercial medical products  the higher favorable prior period development during 2014 and 2013 resulted from increased membership better than originally expected utilization across most of our major business lines and increased financial recoveries the increase in financial recoveries primarily resulted from claim audit process enhancements as well as increased volume of claim audits and expanded audit scope all lines of business benefited from these improvements 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2015  estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

benefits expense excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



in the fourth quarter of 2015 we recognized a premium deficiency reserve for our individual commercial medical business compliant with the health care reform law associated with the 2016 coverage year as discussed in more detail in note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

military services benefits expense for 2015 and 2014 reflect expenses associated with our contracts with the veterans administration military services benefits expense for 2013 reflects the beneficial effect of a favorable settlement of contract claims with the dod partially offset by expenses associated with our contracts with the veterans administration 

certain health policies sold to individuals prior to 2014 the first year plans compliant with the health care reform law were effective are accounted for as longduration as more fully described below the reduction in future policy benefits in 2015 reflects the release of reserves as individual commercial medical members transition to plans compliant with the health care reform law 

future policy benefits payable of 22 billion  and 23 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care insurance life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on premium rate increase interest rate mortality morbidity persistency the percentage of policies remaining inforce and maintenance expense assumptions interest rates are based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business mortality a measure of expected death and morbidity a measure of health status assumptions are based on published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is issued and only change if our expected future experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs ie the loss recognition date because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative we perform loss recognition tests at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums may not be adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs 

future policy benefits payable include 15 billion  at december 31 2015  and   2014   associated with a nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 acquisition of kmg  approximately 31800  policies remain in force as of december 31 2015  no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block future policy benefits payable includes amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income for an additional liability that would exist on our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies if unrealized gains on the sale of the investments backing such products had been realized and the proceeds reinvested at then current yields there was no  additional liability at december 31 2015  and 123 million of additional liability at december 31   2014  amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income are net of applicable deferred taxes 

longterm care insurance policies provide nursing home and home health coverage for which premiums are collected many years in advance of benefits paid if any therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligation under long term care policies because the long duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets further we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold to the extent premium rate increases interest rates andor loss experience vary from our loss recognition date assumptions future material adjustments to reserves could be required 

during 2013 we recorded a loss for a premium deficiency the premium deficiency was based on current and anticipated experience that had deteriorated from our lockedin assumptions from the previous december 31 2010 loss recognition date particularly as they related to emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies and utilization of home health care services based on this deterioration and combined with lower interest rates we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our closed block of longterm care insurance policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits and maintenance costs under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during 2013 we recorded 243 million  of additional benefits expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 350 million  partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 107 million  included in other longterm assets 

for our closed block of longterm care policies actuarial assumptions used to estimate reserves are inherently uncertain due to the potential changes in trends in mortality morbidity persistency and interest rates as well as premium rate increases as a result our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if these trends develop adversely to our expectations the estimated increase in reserves and additional benefit expense from hypothetically modeling adverse variations in our actuarial assumptions in the aggregate could be up to 400 million  net of reinsurance although such hypothetical revisions are not currently appropriate we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectation of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur and any such revision could be material generally accepted accounting principles do not allow us to unlock our assumptions for favorable items 

in addition future policy benefits payable includes amounts of 205 million  at december 31 2015  210 million  at december 31 2014  and 215 million  at december 31 2013  which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per employee basis for each month of coverage based on the type of coverage purchased single to family coverage options our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premiums revenue and administrative services only or aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay and for estimated rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on 

available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from for our medicare and individual commercial medical products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans rates paid to medicare advantage plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 91 billion  or 37  of total assets at december 31 2015  and 95 billion  or 41  of total assets at december 31 2014  debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2015  and 2014  the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2015  and 2014  



approximately 98  of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa  by sp at december 31 2015  most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb  the 

higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 178 million  at december 31 2015  and 199 million  at december 31 2014  these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established taxexempt municipal securities that were not prerefunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of us states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds general obligation bonds which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer accounted for 10 billion  of these municipals in the portfolio special revenue bonds issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education and supported by the revenues of that project accounted for 14 billion  of these municipals our general obligation bonds are diversified across the us with no individual state exceeding 11  in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our taxexempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 173 million  and 484 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively of taxexempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent weighted average sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa  

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was 1 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 25  at december 31 2015  and 21  at december 31 2014  

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2015  



under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows 

to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

the recoverability of our nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities is supported by factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements these residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities at december 31 2015  primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit support with over 99  of the collateral consisting of prime loans the weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgagebacked securities was aa  at december 31 2015  

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2015  remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets than when the securities were purchased at december 31 2015  we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2015  there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2015  2014  or 2013  

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2015  goodwill and other longlived assets represented 20  of total assets and 48  of total stockholders’ equity compared to 24  and 59  respectively at december 31 2014  

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition the carrying amount of goodwill for our reportable segments has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the 2015 segment change discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we use a twostep process to review goodwill for impairment the first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill with the exception of our provider services reporting unit in our healthcare services segment the provider services reporting unit would decline to approximately 10 margin after factoring in a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense prior to 2009 under interest rate swap agreements we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements in 2008 we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2015  or december 31 2014  

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa  at december 31 2015  our net unrealized position decreased   383 million  from a net unrealized gain position of 475 million  at december 31 2014  to a net unrealized gain position of 92 million  at december 31 2015  at december 31 2015  we had gross unrealized losses of 126 million  on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates since the time the securities were purchased there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2015  while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the 

sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 41 years  as of december 31 2015  and 41 years  as of december 31 2014  based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 459 million  

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2015  and 2014  our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once  have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points two  times and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven  times

humana inc was organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 and our website address is wwwhumanacom we have made available free of charge through the investor relations section of our web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statements and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission

health care reform 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry implementation dates of the health care reform law began in september 2010 and will continue through 2018 and many aspects of the health care reform law are already effective and have been implemented by us certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers an annual insurance industry premiumbased assessment and a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee the 

health care reform law is discussed more fully in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health care reform” 

business segments 

on january 1 2014 we reclassified certain of our businesses from our healthcare services segment to our employer group segment to correspond with internal management reporting changes our reportable segments remain the same and prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2014 presentation  see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for segment financial information 

we manage our business with   three   reportable segments retail employer group and healthcare services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos generally require a referral from the member’s primary care provider before seeing certain specialty physicians preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy provider home based and integrated wellness services at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement and sophisticated data analytics three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction engaging members in clinical programs and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2014  



individual medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional feeforservice medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as medicare ffs as an alternative to medicare ffs in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under medicare ffs our medicare advantage plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs chronic care management and care coordination to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of medicare ffs typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide 

members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

most of our medicare pffs plans are networkbased products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans in these areas we offer medicare pffs plans that have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to medicare ffs payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

at december 31 2014  we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 2446200  individual medicare advantage members including approximately 542400  members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 72 billion  which represented approximately 278  of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 150  of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2015  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2015  have been approved 

individual medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp plan cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “medicare part d provisions” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2015  and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2015  have been approved 

we have administered cms’s limited income newly eligible transition or linet prescription drug plan program since 2010 this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet prescription drug plan program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

medicare and medicaid dual eligible and longterm care support services 

medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries or dual eligibles the dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of medicaid and medicare costs there were approximately 96 million  dual eligible individuals in the united states in 2014  trending upward due to medicaid eligibility expansions and individuals aging into the medicare program these dual eligibles may enroll in a privatelyoffered medicare advantage product but may also receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing the dual eligible population is a strategic area of focus for us and we are leveraging the capabilities of our integrated care delivery model including care management programs particularly as they relate to chronic conditions to expand our services to this population as of december 31 2014  we served approximately 404000  dual eligible members in our medicare advantage plans and approximately 992000  dual eligible members in our standalone prescription drug plans 

since the enactment of the health care reform law states are pursuing standalone dual eligible cms demonstration programs in which medicare medicaid and longterm care support services ltss benefits are more tightly integrated eligibility for participation in these standalone dual eligible demonstration programs may require statebased contractual relationships in existing medicaid programs we were successful in our bids for statebased contracts in florida and virginia in 2013 and in ohio illinois and kentucky in 2012 ohio illinois and virginia are contracts for standalone dual eligible demonstration programs serving individuals dually eligible for both the federal medicare program and the statebased medicaid program we began serving members in illinois in the first quarter of 2014 and in virginia in the second quarter of 2014 we partner with organizations including caresource management group company to serve individuals in certain states we began serving members in kentucky and certain ltss regions in florida at various effective dates ranging from the second half of 2013 through the first quarter of 2014 

ltss eligible beneficiaries heavily overlap with the dual eligible population on september 6 2013  we acquired american eldercare inc or american eldercare the largest provider of nursing home diversion services in the state of florida serving frail and elderly individuals in home and communitybased settings american eldercare complements our core capabilities and strength in serving seniors and disabled individuals with a unique focus on individualized and integrated care and has contracts to provide medicaid longterm support services across the entire state of florida the enrollment effective dates for the various regions ranged from august 2013 to march 2014

military services 

under our tricare south region contract with the united states department of defense or dod we provide administrative services to arrange health care services for the dependents of active duty military personnel and for retired military personnel and their dependents we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the dod on april 1 2012 we began delivering services under our current tricare south region contract that the defense health agency or dha formerly known as the tricare management activity awarded to us on february 25 2011 under the current contract we provide administrative services while the federal government retains all of the risk of the cost of health benefits accordingly we account for revenues under the current contract net of estimated health care costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement 

closed block of longterm care insurance policies 

we have a nonstrategic closed block of approximately 32700  longterm care insurance policies associated with our acquisition of kmg america corporation in 2007 longterm care insurance policies are intended to protect the insured from the cost of longterm care services including those provided by nursing homes assisted living facilities and adult day care as well as home health care services no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block and we are evaluating strategic alternatives for this business 

informatics 

programs to enhance the quality of care for members are key elements of our integrated care delivery model we believe that technology represents a significant opportunity in health care that positively impacts our members we have enhanced our health information technology capabilities enabling us to create a more complete view of an individual’s health designed to connect coordinate and simplify health care while reducing costs these capabilities include our health care analytics engine which reviews millions of clinical data points each day to provide members providers and payers realtime clinical insights and gapsincare data to improve health outcomes as well as technology that allows disparate electronic health record systems and humana to share data that gives providers a comprehensive view of the patient and enables the exchange of essential health information in realtime as we have integrated these and related assets into our operations over the past few years we have enhanced our ability to leverage predictive modeling capabilities that enable us to anticipate rather than react to our members’ health needs to that end we have accelerated our process for identifying and reaching out to members in need of clinical intervention at december 31 2014  we had approximately 420700  members with complex chronic conditions in the humana chronic care program 

a 501  increase compared with approximately 280200  members at december 31 2013  reflecting enhanced predictive modeling capabilities and focus on proactive clinical outreach and member engagement particularly for our medicare advantage membership we believe these initiatives lead to better health outcomes for our members and lower health care costs 

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2014  by market and product 



provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we employ or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met 

we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

automatic reductions to the federal budget known as sequestration took effect on april 1 2013 including aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year due to the uncertainty around the application of these reductions there can be no assurances that we can completely offset any reductions to the medicare healthcare programs see “legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters” in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

capitation 

we offer providers a continuum of opportunities to increase the integration of care and offer assistance to providers in transitioning from a feeforservice to a valuebased arrangement these include performance bonuses shared savings and shared risk relationships for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo membership under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries 

at december 31 2014  approximately 883000  members or 64  of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts including 709000  individual medicare advantage members or 290  of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 141200  hmo members including 113200  individual medicare advantage members or 160  of the 709000  individual medicare advantage members covered under riskbased contracts at december 31 2014  with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the 

underlying claims experience was approximately 833 million  or 22  of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2014  we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and urac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo additionally all products sold on the federal and state marketplaces are required to be accredited certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa reviews our compliance based on standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in most of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos markets with enough history and membership except puerto rico and for many of our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2014  we employed approximately 1700  sales representatives as well as approximately 1200  telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of individual medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products in our retail segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our individual medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country which provides an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our individual medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our employer group segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members in addition we have begun to offer plans to employer groups through private exchanges employers can give their employees a set amount of money and then direct them to a private exchange there employees can shop for a health plan and other benefits based on what the employer has selected as options we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers we use licensed independent brokers independent agents and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products 

underwriting 

beginning in 2014 the health care reform law requires all individual and group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments accordingly newly issued individual and group health plans are not subject to underwriting in 2014 and beyond further underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

prior to 2014 through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determined the risk we were willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups had to meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in item 1a – risk factors in this 2014  form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a – risk factors in this 2014  form 10k 

certain other services 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing billingenrollment and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 57000  employees and approximately 2700  additional medical professionals working under management agreements primarily between concentra and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 




 item 1a risk factors 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns these estimates however involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower the cost of healthcare services delivered to our members and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including longterm care life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental insurance policies sold to individuals for which some 

of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from the assumptions we have locked in additional future adjustments to reserves could be required 

while we proactively attempt to effectively manage our operating expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs statebased contracts participation in health insurance exchanges and expansion of clinical capabilities as part of our integrated care delivery model investments in health and wellbeing product offerings acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments under the health care reform law and implementation of regulatory requirements may increase our operating expenses 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable or effectively manage our operating expenses may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program or competitors in the delivery of health care services we may also face increased competition due to participation by other insurers in the health insurance exchanges implemented under the health care reform law we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

the policies and decisions of the federal and state governments regarding the medicare military medicaid and health insurance exchange programs in which we participate have a substantial impact on our profitability these governmental policies and decisions which we cannot predict with certainty directly shape the premiums or other revenues to us under the programs the eligibility and enrollment of our members the services we provide to our members and our administrative health care services and other costs associated with these programs legislative or regulatory actions such as those resulting in a reduction in premium payments to us an increase in our cost of administrative and health care services or additional fees taxes or assessments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose membership with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership with unfavorable 

medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our statebased contracts strategy and our participation in the new health insurance exchanges our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in these products 

our future performance depends in large part upon our ability to execute our strategy including opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs the successful implementation of our integrated care delivery model our strategy with respect to statebased contracts including those covering members dually eligible for the medicare and medicaid programs and our participation in health insurance exchanges 

we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we offer both standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plans with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer a medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 72  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  generated from our medicare products in particular our contracts with cms in florida these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

the recently implemented health care reform law created a federal medicaremedicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles this medicaremedicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of care between medicare and medicaid depending upon the results of those demonstration projects cms may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives to address the dual eligibles opportunity including our participation in statebased contracts or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members our business may be materially adversely affected 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial products including participation in the new health insurance exchanges introduction of new products and benefit designs including humanavitality and other wellness products growth of our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products the adoption of new technologies development of adjacent businesses and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives including implementing our integrated care delivery model that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have reduced the number of systems we operate have 

upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

there can be no assurance that our information technology or it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we are unable to defend our information technology security systems against cybersecurity attacks or prevent other privacy or data security incidents that result in security breaches that disrupt our operations or in the unintended dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could be exposed to significant regulatory fines or penalties liability or reputational damage or experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in the ordinary course of our business we process store and transmit large amounts of data including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or a thirdparty a cybersecurity attack may penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of thirdparties create system disruptions cause shutdowns or deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our it security systems successfully could materially affect us due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our members customers providers and other stakeholders 

the costs to eliminate or address cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be substantial our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential members in addition breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other thirdparties could expose our members’ private information and result in the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or other thirdparties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in significant regulatory fines or penalties litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 

our business may be materially adversely impacted by the adoption of a new coding set for diagnoses 

federal regulations related to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended hipaa contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information icd9 the current system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the united states was scheduled to be replaced by icd10 code sets on october 1 2014 however on april 1 2014 the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 was signed into law delaying implementation of icd10 until at least october 1 2015 for dates of service on or after the date of final implementation health plans and providers will be required to use icd10 codes for such diagnoses and procedures while we have prepared for the transition to icd10 if unforeseen circumstances arise it is possible that we could be exposed to investigations and allegations of noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition if some providers continue to use icd9 codes on claims after the final implementation date including providers in our network who are employees we will have to reject such claims which may lead to claim resubmissions increased call volume and provider and customer dissatisfaction further providers may use icd10 codes differently than they used icd9 codes in the past which could result in lost revenues under risk adjustment during the transition to icd10 certain claims processing and payment information we have historically used to establish our reserves may not be reliable or available in a timely manner if we do not adequately implement the new icd10 coding set or if providers in our network do not adequately transition to the new icd10 coding set our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages or changes in our business practices increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including breach of contract actions employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 21 

 

in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may materially adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services or otherwise change our business practices may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 76  of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

 22 

performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false claims act as a government contractor we may be subject to qui tam litigation brought by individuals who seek to sue on behalf of the government alleging that the government contractor submitted false claims to the government litigation of this nature is filed under seal to allow the government an opportunity to investigate and to decide if it wishes to intervene and assume control of the litigation if the government does not intervene the lawsuit is unsealed and the individual may continue to prosecute the action on his or her own 

 cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data these audits are referred to herein as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans 

in 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provides that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire ma contract based upon a comparison to “benchmark” audit data in medicare ffs which we refer to as the ffs adjuster this comparison to the medicare ffs benchmark audit is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of audit results because the government program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set provides the basis for ma plans’ risk adjustment to payment rates cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between ma plans and medicare ffs data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in ma plan data versus the government program data set   

the final methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to the current round of radv contract level audits being conducted on 2011 premium payments selected ma contracts will be notified of an audit at some point after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited the final reconciliation occurs in august of the calendar year following the payment year we have been notified that certain of our medicare advantage contracts have been selected for audit for contract year 2011   

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information we perform internal contract level audits based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits is an audit of our private feeforservice business which we used to represent a proxy of the benchmark audit data in medicare ffs which has not yet been released we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for contract years 2011 the first year that application of extrapolated audit results is applicable through 2014 on the results of these internal contract level audits and update our estimates as each audit is completed estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows however 

as indicated we are awaiting additional guidance from cms regarding the benchmark audit data in medicare ffs accordingly we cannot determine whether such radv audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows   

in addition cms’ recent comments in formalized guidance regarding “overpayments” to medicare advantage plans appear to be inconsistent with cms’ prior radv audit guidance these statements contained in the preamble to cms’ final rule release regarding medicare advantage and part d prescription drug benefit program regulations for contract year 2015 appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an “overpayment” without reconciliation to the principles underlying the ffs adjuster referenced above we will continue to work with cms to ensure that medicare advantage plans are paid accurately and that payment model principles are in accordance with the requirements of the social security act which if not implemented correctly could have material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net receivable of 69 million  at december 31 2014  

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome subsidy or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 24 

two years we expect a corresponding substantial reduction in our obligations to providers due to the uncertainty around the application of any such reductions there can be no assurances that we can completely offset any reductions to the medicare healthcare programs applied by the budget control act of 2011   

 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets   increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry the provisions of the health care reform law include among others imposing a significant new nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health care reform law also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers subject to federal administrative action and expands eligibility for medicaid programs subject to statebystate implementation of this expansion in addition the health care reform law has increased and will continue to increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare implementation dates of the provisions of the health care reform law began in september 2010 and continue through 2018 if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health care reform law our business may be materially adversely affected for additional information please refer to the section entitled “health care reform” in “item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” appearing in this annual report 

 our participation in the new federal and state health insurance exchanges which entail uncertainties associated with mix volume of business and the operation of premium stabilization programs which are subject to federal administrative action could adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the health care reform law required the establishment of health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance that became effective january 1 2014 with an annual open enrollment period insurers participating on the health insurance exchanges must offer a minimum level of benefits and are subject to guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations we may be adversely selected by individuals who have a higher acuity level than the anticipated pool of participants in this market in addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the health care reform law established to apportion risk for insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to our products in addition regulatory changes to the implementation of the health care reform law that allowed individuals to remain in plans that are not compliant with the health care reform law may have an adverse effect on our pool of participants in the health insurance exchange all of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows if our premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals any variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions used in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application including reductions in medicare advantage payment rates could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to the health care reform law the health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans and providers 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa on january 17 2013 hhs issued the omnibus final rule on hipaa privacy security breach notification requirements and enforcement requirements under the hitech act and a final regulation for required changes to the hipaa privacy rule for the genetic information nondiscrimination act or gina the omnibus final rule became effective on march 26 2013 with a compliance date of september 23 2013 among other requirements the hitech act and omnibus final rule mandates individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to state attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to the us department of health and human services in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires the us department of health and human services to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between certain of our subsidiaries and affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services 

to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions divestitures and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions divestitures strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue our acquisition 

strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally in addition from time to time we evaluate alternatives for our businesses that do not meet our strategic growth or profitability objectives among the businesses that we are currently evaluating is our closed block of longterm care insurance policies business while no decision has been made with respect to any course of action if we were to divest this business it is reasonably likely that we would have to recognize a material loss that will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the divestiture of certain other businesses could also result individually or in the aggregate in the recognition of material losses and a material adverse effect on our results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such divestitures on terms favorable to us 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we employ or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers a key component of our integrated care delivery strategy is to increase the number of providers who share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts with us or place us at a competitive disadvantage or do not enter into contracts with us that encourage the delivery of quality medical services in a costeffective manner our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed fee per month to provide a basket of required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy mail order business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies and other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally 

regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations requiring registration with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance   

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost it is uncertain whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from certain of our licensed subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company certain of our insurance subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans administrative expense reimbursements or other cash transfers to humana inc and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entitys level of 

statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix dividends from our noninsurance companies such as in our healthcare services segment are generally not restricted by departments of insurance in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

executive overview 

general 

humana inc headquartered in louisville ky is a leading health and wellbeing company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care our strategy integrates care delivery the member experience and clinical and consumer insights to encourage engagement behavior change proactive clinical outreach and wellness for the millions of people we serve across the country 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs which excludes depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

business segments 

on january 1 2014 we reclassified certain of our businesses from our healthcare services segment to our employer group segment to correspond with internal management reporting changes our reportable segments remain the same and prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2014 presentation  this is further described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

we manage our business with   three   reportable segments retail employer group and healthcare services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

the retail segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products marketed directly to individuals and includes our contract with cms to administer the linet prescription drug plan program and contracts with various states to provide medicaid dual eligible and longterm support services benefits collectively our statebased contracts the employer group segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and voluntary benefit products as well as administrative services only or aso products and our health and wellness products primarily marketed to employer groups the healthcare services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions provider services home based services integrated behavioral health services and predictive modeling and informatics services the other businesses category consists of our military services primarily our tricare south region contract puerto rico medicaid and closedblock longterm care insurance policies 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider home based and behavioral health to our retail and employer group customers intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest 

expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at the corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations 

seasonality 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

our employer group segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of medicare standalone pdp in the retail segment with the employer group’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses similarly certain of our fullyinsured individual commercial medical products in our retail segment experience seasonality in the benefit ratio akin to the employer group segment including the effect of existing members transitioning to policies compliant with the health care reform law 

in addition the retail segment also experiences seasonality in the operating cost ratio as a result of costs incurred in the second half of the year associated with the medicare and individual health care exchange marketing seasons

 health care reform 

the health care reform law enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry implementation dates of the health care reform law began in september 2010 and will continue through 2018 and many aspects of the health care reform law are already effective and have been implemented by us certain significant provisions of the health care reform law include among others mandated coverage requirements mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers an annual insurance industry premiumbased assessment and a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee certain provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014 including 

 43 

the health care reform law also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers subject to federal administrative action and expands eligibility for medicaid programs subject to statebystate implementation of this expansion in addition the health care reform law has increased and will continue to increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms comes in part from material additional fees and taxes on us as discussed above and other health plans and individuals which began in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described in this report 

as discussed above it is reasonably possible that the health care reform law and related regulations as well as future legislative changes including legislative restrictions on our ability to manage our provider network or otherwise operate our business or regulatory restrictions on profitability including by comparison of our medicare advantage profitability to our nonmedicare advantage business profitability and a requirement that they remain within certain ranges of each other in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs further lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows including the receipt of amounts due under the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law in 2015 related to claims paid in 2014 which payments may be subject to federal administrative action 

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments primarily consist of sales of services rendered by our healthcare services segment primarily pharmacy provider and behavioral health services to our retail and employer group customers and are described in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

comparison of results of operations for 2014  and 2013   

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  

consolidated 



 

 summary 

net income was 11 billion  or 736  per diluted common share in 2014  compared to 12 billion  or 773  per diluted common share in 2013  net income for 2014 includes expenses of 015  per diluted common share associated with a loss on extinguishment of debt for the redemption of certain senior notes in 2014  and net income for 2013   

includes benefits expense of 099 per diluted common share for reserve strengthening associated with our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies included with other businesses as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data as well as the benefit of a reduction in benefits expense in 2013  related to a favorable settlement of contract claims with the dod excluding these items the increase in net income primarily resulted from higher pretax income in our healthcare services segment substantially offset by lower pretax income in our retail and employer group segments in addition 2014 was favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per common share reflecting the impact of share repurchases 

  premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased   71 billion  or 184  from 2013  to 460 billion  for 2014  primarily due to increases in both retail and employer group segment premiums mainly driven by higher average individual and group medicare advantage membership as well as higher individual commercial medical membership in addition yearoveryear comparisons to the 2013  were negatively impacted by sequestration which became effective april 1 2013 premiums revenue for our other businesses declined primarily due to the loss of our puerto rico medicaid contracts effective september 30 2013 average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased   55 million  or 26  from 2013  to 22 billion  for 2014  primarily due to an increase in services revenue in our retail segment due to the acquisition of american eldercare in september 2013 

investment income 

investment income totaled 377 million  for 2014  an increase  of 2 million  from 2013  as higher average invested balances were partially offset by lower interest rates 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 382 billion  for 2014  an increase  of 56 billion  or 172  from 2013  primarily due to increases in both the retail and employer group segments mainly driven by higher average individual and group medicare advantage membership as well as higher individual commercial medical membership as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 518 million  in 2014  and 474 million  in 2013  these increases in favorable medical claims reserve development primarily resulted from increased membership and better than originally expected utilization across most of our major business lines and increased financial recoveries the increase in financial recoveries primarily resulted from claim audit process enhancements as well as increased volume of claim audits and expanded audit scope all lines of business benefited from these improvements 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2014  was 830  a decrease  of 90  basis points from 2013  primarily due to reserve strengthening in 2013  associated with our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies included with other businesses as discussed above as well as the loss of our medicaid contracts in puerto rico effective september 30 2013 which more than offset higher ratios yearoveryear in the retail and employer group segments 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased   1284 million  or 202  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to costs mandated by the health care reform law including the nondeductible health insurance industry fee and investments in health care exchanges and statebased contracts partially offset by operating cost efficiencies 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2014  was 159  increasing   40  basis points from 2013  primarily due to increases in the operating cost ratios in our retail and employer group segments due to the same factors impacting consolidated operating costs as described above 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2014  totaled 333 million  unchanged from 2013  

interest expense 

interest expense was 192 million  for 2014  compared to 140 million  for 2013  an increase  of 52 million  or 371  in september 2014 we issued 400 million of 2625 senior notes due october 1 2019 600 million of 385 senior notes due october 1 2024 and 750 million of 495 senior notes due october 1 2044 in october 2014 we redeemed the 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2016 at 100   of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt included in interest expense of approximately 37 million   in connection with the redemption of these notes 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2014  was 472  compared to the effective tax rate of 359  in 2013  the nondeductible nature of the health insurance industry fee levied on the insurance industry beginning in 2014 as mandated by the health care reform law increased our effective tax rate by approximately 94  percentage points for 2014  see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

comparison of results of operations for 2013 and 2012 

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

consolidated 



 summary 

net income was 12 billion or 773 per diluted common share in 2013 compared to 12 billion or 747 per diluted common share in 2012 the increase in net income primarily was driven by improved operating performance across most of our major business lines including medicare advantage membership growth in our retail and employer 

group segments these increases were partially offset by benefits expense of 099 per diluted common share in 2013 for reserve strengthening associated with our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies included with other businesses as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data yearoveryear comparisons of diluted earnings per common share are favorably impacted by a lower number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per common share in 2013 reflecting the impact of share repurchases 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased 18 billion or 49 from 2012 to 388 billion for 2013 primarily due to increases in both retail and employer group segment premiums mainly driven by higher average individual and group medicare advantage membership partially offset by the impact of sequestration which became effective april 1 2013 as well as a decline in premiums for other businesses the decline in premiums for other businesses primarily reflects the transition to the current tricare south region contract effective april 1 2012 and the termination of the puerto rico medicaid contracts effective september 30 2013 as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data on april 1 2012 we began delivering services under the current tricare south region contract that the dha awarded to us on february 25 2011 we account for revenues under the current contract net of estimated healthcare costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement and as such there are no premiums recognized under the current contract our previous contract was accounted for similar to our fullyinsured products and as such we recognized premiums under the previous contract 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased 383 million or 222 from 2012 to 21 billion for 2013 primarily due to an increase in services revenue in our healthcare services segment and an increase in services revenue for our other businesses due to the transition to the current tricare south region contract on april 1 2012 the increase in services revenue in our healthcare services segment primarily resulted from the acquisitions of metropolitan on december 21 2012 and seniorbridge on july 6 2012 and growth in our provider services operations 

investment income 

investment income totaled 375 million for 2013 a decrease of 16 million from 2012 as higher average invested balances were more than offset by lower interest rates and lower net realized capital gains yearoveryear 

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 326 billion for 2013 an increase of 16 billion or 51 from 2012 primarily due to a yearoveryear increase in the retail and employer group segments benefits expense mainly driven by an increase in the average number of medicare members partially offset by a decrease in benefits expense for other businesses in 2013 the decrease in benefits expense for other businesses primarily was due to the transition to the current administrative services only tricare south region contract on april 1 2012 and the termination of the puerto rico medicaid contracts effective september 30 2013 we do not record benefits expense under the current tricare south region contract our previous contract was accounted for similarly to our fullyinsured products and as such we recorded benefits expense under the previous contract retail segment benefits expense increased 19 billion or 89 from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to membership growth as more fully described herein under the section entitled “benefits expense recognition” actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 474 million in 2013 and 257 million in 2012 these increases in favorable medical claims reserve development primarily resulted from claims trend for the prior year ultimately developing more favorably than originally expected across most of our major business lines and increased financial recoveries the increase in financial recoveries primarily resulted from claim audit process enhancements as well as increased volume of claim audits and expanded audit scope 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2013 was 839 an increase of 20 basis points from 2012 primarily due to reserve strengthening associated with our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies included with other 

businesses as discussed above partially offset by the increase in favorable prioryear medical claims reserve development of 217 million from 2012 to 2013 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased 525 million or 90 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in operating costs in our retail and healthcare services segments the increase in the retail segment primarily reflects investment spending for exchanges under the health care reform law and new statebased contracts as well as increased marketing spending for medicare 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2013 was 155 increasing 40 basis points from 2012 the impact of the current tricare south region contract being accounted for as an administrative services fee only arrangement beginning april 1 2012 was partially offset by improved operating leverage in our retail and employer group segments 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2013 totaled 333 million an increase of 38 million or 129 from 2012 primarily due to capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization associated with 2012 and 2013 acquisitions 

interest expense 

interest expense was 140 million for 2013 compared to 105 million for 2012 an increase of 35 million or 333 in december 2012 we issued 600 million of 315 senior notes due december 1 2022 and 400 million of 4625 senior notes due december 1 2042

in our group medicare advantage products which generally carry a higher benefit ratio than our fullyinsured commercial group products the employer group segment’s benefits expense included the beneficial effect of 138 million  in favorable prioryear medical claims reserve development versus 48 million  in 2012 the change in favorable prioryear medical claims reserve development from 2012 to 2013 primarily was driven by claims trend for the prior year ultimately developing more favorably than originally expected and increased financial recoveries the increase in financial recoveries primarily resulted from claim audit process enhancements as well as increased volume of claim audits and expanded audit scope this favorable prioryear medical claims reserve development decreased the employer group segment benefit ratio by approximately 130 basis points in 2013 versus approximately 50 basis points in 2012

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items including taxes and assessments the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent our use of operating cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by departments of insurance 

for 2014 the effect of the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions of the health care reform law commonly referred to as the 3rs impacted the timing of our operating cash flows as we built a receivable in 2014 that is expected to be collected in 2015 the net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was 679 million  at december 31 2014  in addition our 2014 financing cash flows have been negatively impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d reinsurance subsidies for which we do not assume risk we are experiencing higher specialty prescription drug costs associated with a new treatment for hepatitis c than were contemplated in our bids which resulted in higher reinsurance subsidy receivables balances in 2014 that will be settled in 2015 under the terms of our contracts with cms any amounts receivable or payable associated with these risk limiting programs and cms subsidies may have an impact on regulated subsidiary liquidity with any temporary shortfalls funded by the parent company

cash and cash equivalents increased  to 19 billion  at december 31 2014  from 11 billion  at december 31 2013  the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  is summarized as follows 



cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings enrollment activity and the timing of working capital items as discussed below cash flows were positively impacted by annual medicare enrollment gains because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months in addition 2014 operating cash flows were impacted by lower earnings and increased receivables associated with the 3rs partially offset by an increase in benefits payable from growth in membership 

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and payments of benefits expense we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



medicare receivables are impacted by revenue growth associated with growth in individual and group medicare membership and the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the increases in commercial and other receivables in 2014  and 2013  primarily are due to growth in the business in addition the increase in commercial and other receivables in 2014  is primarily due to the commercial risk adjustment provision of the health care reform law which became effective in 2014 

military services receivables at december 31 2014  and 2013  primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our current tricare south region contract the 409 million decrease in military services receivables from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 primarily resulted from the transition to our current tricare south region contract which we account for similar to 

an administrative services fee only agreement as such beginning april 1 2012 payments of the federal government’s claims and related reimbursements for the current tricare south region contract are classified with receipts withdrawals from contract deposits as a financing item in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



 the increase  in benefits payable in 2014  primarily was due to an increase  in ibnr primarily as a result of medicare advantage and individual commercial membership growth and an increase  in the amount of processed but unpaid claims due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff these items were partially offset by a decrease in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements primarily related to the disbursement of a portion of our medicare risk adjustment collections under our contractual obligations associated with our risk sharing arrangements the increase in benefits payable in 2013 primarily was due to an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff and an increase in ibnr primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth the increase in benefits payable in 2012 primarily was due to an increase in ibnr primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth partially offset by a 335 million  decrease in the military services benefits payable due to the runout of claims under the previous tricare south region contract that expired on march 31 2012 a decrease in the amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements and a decrease in the amounts due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff under the current tricare south region contract effective april 1 2012 the federal government retains the risk of the cost of health benefits and related benefit obligation as further described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

many provisions of the health care reform law became effective in 2014 including the commercial risk adjustment risk corridor and reinsurance provisions as well as the nondeductible health insurance industry fee as discussed previously the timing of payments and receipts associated with these provisions impacted our operating cash 

flows as we built a receivable in 2014 that is expected to be collected in 2015 the net receivable balance associated with the 3rs was approximately 679 million  at december 31 2014  including certain amounts recorded in receivables as noted above in september 2014 we paid the federal government 562 million  for the annual health insurance industry fee 

in addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and services revenues payments of benefits expense and amounts due under the risk limiting and health insurance industry fee provisions of the health care reform law other working capital items impacting operating cash flows primarily resulted from the timing of payments for the medicare part d risk corridor provisions of our contracts with cms and changes in the timing of the collection of pharmacy rebates 

cash flow from investing activities 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 528 million  in 2014  441 million  in 2013  and 410 million  in 2012  excluding acquisitions we expect total capital expenditures in 2015  to be in a range of approximately 575 million  to 625 million  primarily reflecting increased spending associated with growth in our provider services and pharmacy businesses in our healthcare services segment 

proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities exceeded purchases by 411 million  in 2014 these net proceeds were used to fund normal working capital needs due to an increase in receivables in 2014 that will be collected in 2015 associated with the 3rs in addition to the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d reinsurance subsidies as discussed below we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling 592 million  in 2013  and 320 million  in 2012  

cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired was 18 million  in 2014  187 million  in 2013  and 12 billion  in 2012  acquisitions in 2014  included health and wellness related acquisitions cash paid for acquisitions in 2013  primarily related to the american eldercare and other health and wellness related acquisitions in 2012  acquisitions included metropolitan arcadian seniorbridge and other health and wellness and technology related acquisitions 

cash flow from financing activities 

claims payments were   945 million   higher than receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk  during 2014  155 million higher during 2013 and 341 million higher during 2012 as discussed previously our   2014   financing cash flows have been negatively impacted by the timing of payments to and receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk we experienced higher specialty prescription drug costs associated with a new treatment for hepatitis c than were contemplated in our bids which is resulting in higher subsidy receivable balances in 2014  that will be settled in 2015 under the terms of our contracts with cms our net receivable for cms subsidies and brand name prescription drug discounts was 17 billion  at december 31 2014  compared to 713 million  at december 31 2013  refer to note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

under our current administrative services only tricare south region contract that began april 1 2012 reimbursements from the federal government equaled health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk in 2014  health care cost payments were less than reimbursements by 5 million  in 2013  and exceeded reimbursements by 56 million in 2012  due to the timing of such receipts receipts from hhs associated with cost sharing provisions of the health care reform law for which we do not assume risk were   26 million   higher than claims payments  for the year ended 2014  see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

we repurchased 57 million  shares for 730 million  in 2014  which excludes another 100 million  of stock held back pending final settlement of an accelerated stock repurchase plan 58 million  shares for 502 million  in 2013  and 

63 million  shares for 460 million  in 2012  under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 42 million  in 2014  29 million  in 2013  and 58 million  in 2012  

as discussed further below we paid dividends to stockholders of 172 million  in 2014  168 million  in 2013  and 165 million  in 2012  

in september 2014 we issued 400 million of 2625 senior notes due october 1 2019 600 million of 385 senior notes due october 1 2024 and 750 million of 495 senior notes due october 1 2044 our net proceeds reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses were 173 billion  we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem our 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes   

in december 2012 we issued 600 million of 315 senior notes due december 1 2022 and 400 million of 4625 senior notes due december 1 2042 our net proceeds reduced for the discount and cost of the offering were 990 million we used the proceeds from the offering primarily to finance the acquisition of metropolitan including the retirement of metropolitan’s indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses 

in march 2012 we repaid without penalty junior subordinated longterm debt of 36 million 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2014  2013  and 2012  primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft 

future sources and uses of liquidity 

dividends 

the following table provides details of dividend payments excluding dividend equivalent rights in 2012  2013  and 2014  under our board approved quarterly cash dividend policy 



in october 2014  the board declared a cash dividend of 028  per share that was paid on january 30 2015  to stockholders of record on december 31 2014  for an aggregate amount of 42 million  declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 

stock repurchase authorization 

in september 2014  the board of directors replaced its previously approved share repurchase authorization of up to 1 billion  of which 816 million  remained unused with the current authorization for repurchases of up to 2 billion  of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans expiring on december 31 2016  under the current share repurchase authorization shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases or in privatelynegotiated transactions including pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement with investment banks subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume pricing and timing as of february 18 2015  the remaining authorized amount under the current authorization totaled approximately 137 billion  after giving effect to the 500 million accelerated share repurchase program we entered into in november 2014 with goldman sachs  co 

senior notes 

in september 2014 we issued 400 million of 2625 senior notes due october 1 2019 600 million of 385 senior notes due october 1 2024 and 750 million of 495 senior notes due october 1 2044 our net proceeds 

reduced for the underwriters discount and commission and offering expenses were 173 billion  we used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem the 500 million   645  senior unsecured notes as discussed below 

in october 2014 we redeemed the 500 million 645 senior unsecured notes due june 1 2016 at 100   of the principal amount plus applicable premium for early redemption and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  for cash totaling approximately 560 million  we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt included in interest expense of approximately 37 million  in connection with the redemption of these notes 

credit agreement 

our   5 year   10 billion   unsecured revolving credit agreement expires july 2018 under the credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread the libor spread currently   110   basis points varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 90  to 150   basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently   15   basis points may fluctuate between   10  and 25   basis points depending upon our credit ratings the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option 

the terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds in addition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of   78 billion   at december 31 2014   and a maximum leverage ratio of 301  we are in compliance with the financial covenants with actual net worth of   96 billion   and actual leverage ratio of 141  as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of december 31   2014  in addition the credit agreement includes an uncommitted 250 million  incremental loan facility 

at december 31 2014  we had no  borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement we have outstanding letters of credit of 4 million  issued under the credit agreement at december 31 2014  no amounts have been drawn on these letters of credit accordingly as of december 31 2014  we had 996 million  of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement   

commercial paper 

in october 2014 we entered into a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes privately placed on a discount basis through certain broker dealers amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed from time to time with the aggregate face or principal amounts outstanding under the program at any time not to exceed 1 billion  the net proceeds of issuances have been and are expected to be used for general corporate purposes including to repurchase shares of our common stock the maximum principal amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any one time during the year ended   december 31 2014 was 175 million  there were no outstanding borrowings at december 31 2014  

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement and our commercial paper program or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2014  was bbb  according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3  according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis 

points or annual interest expense by 2 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 8 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry humana inc our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries certain of which are subject to regulatory restrictions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated insurance subsidiaries cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company increased to 14 billion  at december 31 2014  from 508 million  at december 31 2013  primarily due to net proceeds of 173 billion  from the september 2014 issuance of senior notes offset by the 560 million  senior note redemption discussed above and share repurchases our use of operating cash flows derived from our noninsurance subsidiaries such as in our healthcare services segment is generally not restricted by departments of insurance our subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of 927 million  in 2014  967 million  in 2013  and 12 billion  in 2012  the declines in dividends to the parent in 2013 and 2014 primarily were a result of higher surplus requirements associated with premium growth refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i – parent company financial information regulatory requirements including subsidiary dividends to the parent are discussed in more detail in the following section excluding puerto rico subsidiaries the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in   2015   is approximately   800 million  in the aggregate 

in september 2014 we paid the federal government   562 million   for the annual health insurance industry fee attributed to calendar year 2014 in accordance with the health care reform law in 2015 the health insurance industry fee increases by 41 for the industry taken as a whole accordingly absent changes in market share we would expect a 41 increase in our fee in 2015

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 



our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing changes in medical management processes product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including recoveries of overpayments receipt cycle times claim inventory levels outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors claim payments to providers for services rendered are often net of overpayment recoveries for claims paid previously as contractually allowed claim overpayment recoveries can result from many different factors including retroactive enrollment activity audits of provider billings andor payment errors changes in patterns of claim overpayment recoveries can be unpredictable and result in completion factor volatility as they often impact older dates of service the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increases in electronic claim submissions from providers decrease the receipt cycle time if claims are submitted or processed on a faster slower pace than prior periods the actual claim may be more less complete than originally estimated using our completion factors which may result in reserves that are higher lower than required 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services new higher priced technologies and medical procedures and new prescription drugs and therapies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of 

each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes the tort liability system increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population lifestyle changes including diet and smoking catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2014  data 



 70 

the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 



the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 



 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 518 million  in 2014  474 million  in 2013  and 257 million  in 2012  the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2014  2013  and 2012  



the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2014  2013  and 2012  primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions in addition the favorable medical claims reserve development during 2014  and 2013  reflects increased membership and better than originally expected utilization across most of our major business lines and increased financial recoveries the increase in financial recoveries primarily resulted from claim audit process enhancements as well as increased volume of claim audits and expanded audit scope all lines of business benefited from these improvements   

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2014  estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

benefits expense associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



due to the transition to the current tricare south region contract on april 1 2012 which is accounted for as an administrative services only contract as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data there was no military services benefits payable at december 31 2014  or 2013  this transition is also the primary reason for the decline in military services benefits expense from 2012 to 2013 

future policy benefits payable of 23 billion  and 22 billion  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care insurance life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years at policy issuance these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity and maintenance expense assumptions interest rates are based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business mortality a measure of expected death and morbidity a measure of health status assumptions are based on published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is issued and only change if our expected future experience deteriorates to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs ie the loss recognition date because these policies have longterm claim payout periods there is a greater risk of significant variability in claims costs either positive or negative we perform loss recognition tests at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums may not be adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits and maintenance costs 

future policy benefits payable include 15 billion  at december 31 2014  and 14 billion  at december 31 2013   associated with a nonstrategic closed block of longterm care insurance policies acquired in connection with the 2007 acquisition of kmg  approximately 32700  policies remain in force as of december 31 2014  no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block future policy benefits payable includes amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income for an additional liability that would exist on our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies if unrealized gains on the sale of the investments backing such products had been realized and the proceeds reinvested at then current yields there was 123 million  of additional liability at december 31 2014  and no additional 

liability at december 31   2013  amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income are net of applicable deferred taxes 

longterm care insurance policies provide nursing home and home health coverage for which premiums are collected many years in advance of benefits paid if any therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest morbidity mortality and maintenance expense assumptions from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies a prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligation under long term care policies because the long duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets further we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care insurance policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold to the extent premium rate increases andor loss experience vary from our loss recognition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required 

during 2013  we recorded a loss for a premium deficiency with respect to our closed block of longterm care insurance policies the premium deficiency was based on current and anticipated experience that had deteriorated from our lockedin assumptions from the previous december 31 2010 loss recognition date particularly as they related to emerging experience due to an increase in life expectancies and utilization of home health care services based on this deterioration and combined with lower interest rates we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits and maintenance costs under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during 2013  we recorded 243 million  of additional benefits expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 350 million  partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 107 million  included in other longterm assets 

during 2012  we recorded a change in estimate associated with future policy benefits payable for our closedblock of longterm care insurance policies resulting in additional benefits expense of 29 million  and a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable this change in estimate was based on current claim experience demonstrating an increase in the length of the time policyholders already in payment status remained in such status future policy benefits payable was increased to cover future payments to policyholders currently in payment status 

for our closed block of longterm care policies actuarial assumptions used to estimate reserves are inherently uncertain due to the potential changes in trends in mortality morbidity persistency the percentage of policies remaining inforce and interest rates as a result our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if these trends develop adversely to our expectations the estimated increase in reserves and additional benefit expense from hypothetically modeling adverse variations in our actuarial assumptions in the aggregate could be up to 300 million net of reinsurance although such hypothetical revisions are not currently appropriate we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectation of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur generally accepted accounting principles do not allow us to unlock our assumptions for favorable items this hypothetical modeling does not contemplate a divestiture situation we are evaluating alternatives related to our closed block of long term care policies while no decision has been made with respect to any course of action if we were to divest this business it is reasonably likely that we would have to recognize a material loss and that loss could exceed the amount provided above 

in addition future policy benefits payable includes amounts of 210 million  at december 31 2014  215 million  at december 31 2013  and 220 million  at december 31 2012  which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per employee basis for each month of coverage based on the type of coverage purchased single to family coverage options our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premiums revenue and administrative services only or aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay and for estimated rebates under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health care reform law  enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium remittances from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from cms for our medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans rates paid to medicare advantage plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s medicare ffs program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 95 billion  or 41  of total assets at december 31 2014  and 98 billion  or 47  of total assets at december 31 2013  debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2014  and 2013  the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2014  and 2013  



approximately 96  of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa  by sp at december 31 2014  most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb  the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 199 million  at december 31 2014  and 222 million  at december 31 2013  these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established taxexempt municipal securities that were not prerefunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of us states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds general obligation bonds which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer accounted for 10 billion  of these municipals in the portfolio special revenue bonds issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education and supported by the revenues of that project accounted for 18 billion  of these municipals our general obligation bonds are diversified across the us with no individual state exceeding 11  in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our taxexempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 484 million  and 548 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively of taxexempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent weighted average sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa  

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was 1 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 21  at december 31 2014  and 23  at december 31 2013  

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2014  



under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

the recoverability of our nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities is supported by factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements these residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities at december 31 2014  primarily were composed of senior tranches having high 

credit support with over 99  of the collateral consisting of prime loans the weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgagebacked securities was aa  at december 31 2014  

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2014  remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates in the current markets than when the securities were purchased at december 31 2014  we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2014  there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2014  2013  or 2012  

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2014  goodwill and other longlived assets represented 24  of total assets and 59  of total stockholders’ equity compared to 27  and 61  respectively at december 31 2013  

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition the carrying amount of goodwill for our reportable segments has been retrospectively adjusted to conform to the 2014  segment change discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

we use a twostep process to review goodwill for impairment the first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the health care reform law the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense prior to 2009 under interest rate swap agreements we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements in 2008 we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 10 billion  unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2014  or december 31 2013  

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa  at december 31 2014  our net unrealized position increased   225 million  from a net unrealized gain position of 250 million  at december 31 2013  to a net unrealized gain position of 475 million  at december 31 2014  at december 31 2014  we had gross unrealized losses of 41 million  on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates in the current markets than when the securities were purchased and as such there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2014 while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 41 years  as of december 31 2014  and 43 years  as of december 31 2013  based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 466 million  

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2014  and 2013  our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once  have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points three  times and have changed by less than 100 basis points six  times

 item 1 business tableend general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc and its subsidiaries referred to throughout this document as “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “humana” is a leading health care company that offers a wide range of insurance products and health and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to lifelong wellbeing as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 121 million members in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 81 million members in our specialty products during 2012 75 of our total premiums and services revenue were derived from contracts with the federal government including 15 derived from our medicare advantage contracts in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms under which we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 384200 members as of december 31 2012 

humana inc was organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 and our website address is wwwhumanacom we have made available free of charge through the investor relations section of our web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statements and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission 

this annual report on form 10k or 2012 form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a – risk factors in this 2012 form 10k for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business 

health insurance reform 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry there are many provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

certain significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation include among others mandated coverage requirements rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of federally facilitated or statebased exchanges coupled with programs 

  

designed to spread risk among insurers an annual insurance industry premiumbased assessment and a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee implementation dates of the health insurance reform legislation began in september 2010 and continue through 2018 the health insurance reform legislation is discussed more fully in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health insurance reform” 

business segments 

we manage our business with three reportable segments retail employer group and health and wellbeing services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

the retail segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products marketed directly to individuals the employer group segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups the health and wellbeing services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including provider services pharmacy integrated wellness and home care services the other businesses category consists of our military services primarily our tricare south region contract medicaid and closedblock longterm care businesses as well as our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition program or the linet program 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our health and wellbeing services segment primarily pharmacy behavioral health and provider services to our retail and employer group customers intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at the corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations 

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos generally require a referral from the member’s primary care provider before seeing certain specialty physicians preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy provider services integrated wellness and home care services at the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model which unites quality care high member engagement 

  

and sophisticated data analytics our approach to primary physiciandirected care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent integrated costeffective and memberfocused the model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole while offering our members a simple seamless healthcare experience the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 25 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under original medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as original medicare as an alternative to original medicare in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under original medicare our medicare advantage plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

  

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original medicare typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions care management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan most hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in some cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

on january 1 2011 most of our members enrolled in pffs plans transitioned to networkedbased ppo type products due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans our medicare pffs plans generally have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to original medicare payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

at december 31 2012 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 1927600 individual medicare advantage members including approximately 384200 members in florida these florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 59 billion which represented approximately 28 of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 15 of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 

our hmo and ppo products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2013 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2013 have been approved

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d including a pdp plan cobranded with walmart stores inc or the humanawalmart plan generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on the following january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our pdp bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “medicare part d provisions” our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp products have been renewed for 2013 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2013 have been approved 

medicare and medicaid dual eligible 

medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries or dual eligibles there were approximately 9 million dual eligible individuals in the united states in 2012 these dual eligibles may enroll in a privatelyoffered medicare advantage product but may also receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits such as nursing home care andor assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing as of december 31 2012 we served approximately 285500 dual eligible members in our medicare advantage plans and approximately 697300 dual eligible members in our standalone prescription drug plans during 2012 we were successful in our bids for medicaid business in ohio illinois and kentucky including dual eligible beneficiaries in both ohio and illinois we partnered with caresource management group company to serve the ohio and kentucky individuals under a march 2012 strategic alliance agreement

other businesses 

products and services offered by our other businesses are described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for our other businesses for the year ended december 31 2012 

 

 military services 

under our tricare south region contract with the united states department of defense or dod we provide administrative services to arrange health care services for the dependents of active duty military 

  

personnel and for retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in an hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers similar to a ppo 

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the dod on april 1 2012 we began delivering services under a new tricare south region contract that the department of defense tricare management activity or tma awarded to us on february 25 2011 under the new contract we provide administrative services including offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs claim processing customer service enrollment and other services while the federal government retains all of the risk of the cost of health benefits accordingly we account for revenues under the new contract net of estimated health care costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement our current tricare south region contract covers approximately 3123900 eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2012 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas oklahoma and kentucky the fort campbell area only the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract the new 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2017 is subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year during its term at the government’s option the tma has notified us of its intent to exercise its option to extend the tricare south region contract through march 31 2014 

our previous tricare south region contract that expired on march 31 2012 provided a financial interest in the underlying health care cost therefore we reported revenues on a gross basis we shared the risk with the federal government for the cost of health benefits incurred under our previous contract earning more revenue or incurring additional cost based on the variance of actual health care costs from an annually negotiated target health care cost the tricare south region contract represented approximately 93 of total military services premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 

medicaid 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a statespecific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

our medicaid business consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico 

linet 

in 2010 we began to administer cms’s linet program this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

  

closed block of longterm care insurance 

we have a closed block of approximately 34000 longterm care policies associated with our acquisition of kmg america corporation in 2007 longterm care policies are intended to protect the insured from the cost of longterm care services including those provided by nursing homes assisted living facilities and adult day care as well as home health care services no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block 

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2012 by market and product 

 

  

 provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers whom we own or with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care providers specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include laboratories ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

  

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems the use of sophisticated analytics and enrolling members into various care management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care provider who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met we have available care management programs related to complex chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease we also have programs for prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index other nationally recognized inflation indexes or specific negotiations with the provider outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the terms of our contracts with hospitals and physicians may also vary between medicare and commercial business a significant portion of our medicare network contracts including those with both hospitals and physicians are tied to medicare reimbursement levels and methodologies 

the budget control act of 2011 established a twelvemember joint committee of congress known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction to propose legislation to reduce the united states federal deficit by 15 trillion for fiscal years 20122021 the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction to achieve a targeted deficit reduction by december 23 2011 triggered an automatic reduction including aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year although these reductions are scheduled to take effect on march 1 2013 at this time it is unclear how this automatic reduction may be applied to various medicare healthcare programs or the timing of when such reductions may actually begin we expect that if such reductions were to occur there would be a corresponding substantial reduction in our obligations to providers due to the uncertainty around the timing or application of any such reductions there can be no assurances that we could completely offset any reductions to the medicare healthcare programs applied by the budget control act of 2011 

capitation 

for some of our medical membership we share risk with providers under capitation contracts where physicians and hospitals accept varying levels of financial risk for a defined set of membership primarily hmo under the typical capitation arrangement we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to cover all or a defined portion of the benefits provided to the capitated member 

  

we believe these riskbased models represent a key element of our integrated care delivery model at the core of our strategy our health plan subsidiaries may enter into these riskbased contracts with third party providers or our owned provider subsidiaries including metropolitan an mso acquired december 21 2012 

at december 31 2012 approximately 1131700 members or 94 of our medical membership were covered under riskbased contracts including 511700 individual medicare advantage members or 265 of our total individual medicare advantage membership 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we typically process all claims and monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we delegated claim processing functions under capitation arrangements covering approximately 124500 hmo members including 73500 individual medicare advantage members at december 31 2012 with the provider assuming substantially all the risk of coordinating the members’ health care benefits capitation expense under delegated arrangements for which we have a limited view of the underlying claims experience was approximately 633 million or 20 of total benefits expense for the year ended december 31 2012 we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

providers participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating providers includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of providers reviews the applications of providers being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and the utilization review accreditation commission or urac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa performs reviews of our compliance with standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in most of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos markets with enough history and membership except puerto rico and for many of our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

  

at december 31 2012 we employed approximately 1700 sales representatives as well as approximately 900 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of individual medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products in our retail segment including making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our individual medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our individual medicare and individual commercial health insurance and specialty products through licensed independent brokers and agents for our medicare products commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure regulated in structure and amount by cms for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

in our employer group segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers we use licensed independent brokers independent agents and employees to sell our group products many of our larger employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we pay brokers and agents using the same commission structure described above for our individual commercial health insurance and specialty products 

underwriting 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions beginning in 2014 the health insurance reform legislation requires all individual and group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in the section entitled “risk factors” in this 2012 form 10k 

  

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see the section entitled “risk factors” in this 2012 form 10k 

certain other services 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing billingenrollment and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 43400 employees and approximately 2400 medical professionals working under management agreements between concentra and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages

 item 1a risk factors tableend if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members if we are unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a better health care experience for our members lower costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members or if our estimates of benefits expense are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefits expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns these estimates however involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in payment patterns and medical cost trends 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 key to our operational strategy is the implementation of clinical initiatives that we believe provide a better health care experience for our members lower these costs and appropriately document the risk profile of our members our profitability and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage health care costs through among other things the application of medical management programs such as our chronic care management program 

  

in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including life insurance annuities health and longterm care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables as modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 11 billion at december 31 2012 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg america corporation acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest rates morbidity rates and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions additional future adjustments to reserves could be required 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in medicare products 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position us for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs including our hmo and ppo products as well as our standalone pdp products and the successful 

  

implementation of our integrated care delivery model we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia 

the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 72 of our total premiums and services revenue in 2012 generated from our medicare products these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

recently enacted health insurance reform legislation created a federal medicaremedicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles this medicaremedicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of care between medicare and medicaid depending upon the results of those demonstration projects cms may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives to address the dual eligibles opportunity or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members our business may be materially adversely affected 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial products such as aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including humanavitality and other wellness products expansion of our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products the adoption of new technologies development of adjacent businesses and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives including outsourcing certain business functions and implementing our integrated care delivery model that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems to protect our proprietary rights to our systems or to defend against cybersecurity attacks our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have reduced the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate 

  

pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents providers and other stakeholders through webenabled technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our information technology or it security systems causing a security breach may lead to a material disruption of our it business systems andor the loss of business information if a cybersecurity attack were to be successful we could be materially adversely affected due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers brokers agents providers and other stakeholders 

there can be no assurance that our it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business may be materially adversely impacted by cms’s adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnoses commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the number of codes utilized we may be required to incur significant expenses in implementing the new coding set by the current compliance date of october 1 2014 if we do not adequately implement the new coding set our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions securities laws claims and tort claims 

  

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see “legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters” in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these matters with certainty 

  

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 78 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected ma contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data these audits are referred to herein as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to ma plans 

on february 24 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the final payment error calculation methodology provides that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for an ma contract if any the results of the audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire ma contract based upon a comparison to “benchmark” audit data in the government feeforservice program this comparison to the government program benchmark audit is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of audit results because the government program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set provides the basis for ma plans’ risk adjustment to payment rates 

the final methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to the next round of radv contract level audits to be conducted on 2011 premium payments selected ma contracts will be notified of an audit at some point after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited the final reconciliation occurs in august of the calendar year following the payment year 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information during 2012 we completed internal contract level audits of certain contracts based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits was an audit of our private feeforservice business which we used to represent a proxy of the benchmark audit data in the government feeforservice program which has not yet been released we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for contract years 2011 the first year that application of extrapolated audit results is applicable and 2012 on the results of these internal contract level audits estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows however as indicated we are awaiting additional guidance from cms regarding the benchmark audit data in the government feeforservice program and the identification of our specific ma contracts that will be selected for audit accordingly we cannot determine whether such audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 356 million at december 31 2012 

  

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 

  

   

recently enacted health insurance reform including the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products and particularly how the ratio may apply to medicare plans lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows in addition if the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments including a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee were imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments such as through the reduction of our operating costs or adjustments to premium pricing or benefit design there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the health insurance reform legislation have been issued to date by the department of health and human services or hhs the department of labor the treasury department and the national association of insurance commissioners there are many provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

the provisions of the health insurance reform legislation include among others imposing significant new nondeductible federal premium taxes and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products and particularly how the ratio may apply to medicare advantage and prescription drug plans additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health insurance reform legislation also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes federallyfacilitated or statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and expands eligibility for medicaid programs in addition the law will increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health plans and individuals beginning in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare implementation dates of the provisions of the health insurance reform legislation began in september 2010 and continue through 2018 

implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the health insurance reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation implementation and timing of these changes which we expect to occur over the next several years the health insurance reform legislation will change the way we do business potentially impacting our pricing benefit design product mix geographic mix and distribution channels in particular implementing regulations and related guidance are forthcoming on various aspects of the minimum benefit ratio requirement’s applicability to medicare including aggregation credibility thresholds and its application to prescription drug plans the response of other companies to health insurance reform legislation and adjustments to their offerings if any could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets it is reasonably possible that the health insurance reform 

  

legislation and related regulations as well as future legislative changes in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health insurance reform legislation our business may be materially adversely affected in addition if the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments including a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee were imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments such as through the reduction of our operating costs or adjustments to premium pricing or benefit design there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application including reductions in medicare advantage payment rates could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to the health insurance reform legislation the health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa among other requirements the hitech act mandates individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations requires business associates to comply with certain provisions of the hipaa privacy and security rule and grants enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights on january 17 2013 hhs issued the omnibus final rule on hipaa privacy security breach notification requirements and enforcement requirements under the hitech act and a final regulation for required changes to the hipaa privacy rule for the genetic information nondiscrimination act or gina the omnibus final rule becomes effective on march 26 2013 with an applicable compliance date of september 23 2013 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations 

  

vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to the us department of health and human services in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires the us department of health and human services to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

workers’ compensation laws and regulations 

in performing services for the workers’ compensation industry through our subsidiary concentra inc we must comply with applicable state workers’ compensation laws workers’ compensation laws generally require employers to assume financial responsibility for medical costs lost wages and related legal costs of workrelated illnesses and injuries these laws generally establish the rights of workers to receive benefits and to appeal benefit denials prohibit charging medical copayments or deductibles to employees may restrict employers’ rights to select healthcare providers or direct an injured employee to a specific provider to receive nonemergency workers’ compensation medical care and may include special requirements for physicians providing nonemergency care for workers’ compensation patients including requiring registration with the state agency governing workers’ compensation as well as special continuing education and training licensing and other regulatory requirements to the extent that we are governed by these regulations we may be subject to additional licensing requirements financial oversight and procedural standards for beneficiaries and providers 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiaries limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between concentra and its affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other 

  

governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases 

  

delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements vary significantly at the state level our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately 51 billion and 47 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements excluding puerto rico subsidiaries the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2013 is approximately 911 million in the aggregate this compares to ordinary dividends that were able to be paid in 2012 of approximately 860 million we expect the amount of dividends to be paid to our parent company in 2013 to approximate the amount of ordinary dividends 

any failure to manage operating costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our operating costs impacts our profitability while we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs and expansion of clinical capabilities a part of our integrated care delivery model greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products investments in health and wellbeing product offerings expansion into new specialty markets acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments under health insurance reform legislation such as the threeyear commercial reinsurance fee and implementation of regulatory requirements may occur from time to time 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our operating costs in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions transactions outside of our core business space or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously the 

  

failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may also be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we own or contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care providers for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs and internet companies as well as other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy in addition some states have proposed laws to regulate online pharmacies and we may be subject to this legislation if it is passed federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations pharmacies must register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in 

  

addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose us to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost recent events have raised uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed 

  

specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our 720 815 315 and 4625 senior notes contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances our 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under recent regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us economy continues to experience a period of slow economic growth and high unemployment we have closely monitored the impact that this volatile economy is having on our operations workforce reductions have caused corresponding membership losses in our fullyinsured commercial group business continued weakness in the us economy and any continued high unemployment may materially adversely affect our medical membership results of operations financial position and cash flows 

additionally the continued weakness of the us economy has adversely affected the budget of individual states and of the federal government this could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military services and medicaid programs and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

in addition general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and other care increasing the costs of claims expenses submitted to us 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

certain european union member states have total fiscal obligations greater than their respective gross domestic products this imbalance has caused investor concern over such countries’ ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth currently the european debt crisis has caused credit spreads to widen and liquidity to tighten in the fixed income debt markets a weaker european economy may transcend europe cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of european financial institutions and the stability of european member economies and likewise adversely affect usbased financial institutions the stability of the global financial markets and the us economy we have no direct exposure to sovereign issuances of spain italy ireland portugal or greece 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

given the current economic climate our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility 

over the past three years the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility companyspecific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the 

  

regulatory environment may have contributed to this volatility our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could materially reduce our stock price in addition broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana is a leading health care company that offers a wide range of insurance products and health and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to lifelong wellbeing by leveraging the strengths of our core businesses we believe that we can better explore opportunities for existing and emerging adjacencies in health care that can further enhance wellness opportunities for the millions of people across the nation with whom we have relationships 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefits expense as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

business segments 

we manage our business with three reportable segments retail employer group and health and wellbeing services in addition the other businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

the retail segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products marketed directly to individuals the employer group segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups the health and wellbeing services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including provider services pharmacy integrated wellness and home care services the other businesses category consists of our military services primarily our tricare south region contract medicaid and closedblock longterm care businesses as well as our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition program or the linet program 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our health and wellbeing services segment primarily pharmacy behavioral health and provider services to our retail and employer group customers intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at the corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations 

  

seasonality 

one of the product offerings of our retail segment is medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program these plans provide varying degrees of coverage our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

our employer group segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of the retail segment with the employer group’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses

 health insurance reform 

the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation enacted significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the health insurance reform legislation have been issued to date by the department of health and human services or hhs the department of labor the treasury department and the national association of insurance commissioners there are many provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

implementation dates of the health insurance reform legislation began in september 2010 and continue through 2018 the following outlines certain provisions of the health insurance reform legislation 

 

  

  

  

   

 the health insurance reform legislation also specifies benefit design guidelines limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants and expands eligibility for medicaid programs in addition the law will increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health plans and individuals beginning in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described herein 

in addition certain provisions in the health insurance reform legislation tie medicare advantage premiums to the achievement of certain quality performance measures star ratings beginning in 2012 medicare advantage plans with an overall star rating of three or more stars out of five were eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates initially quality bonuses were limited to the few plans that achieved four or more stars as an overall rating but cms has expanded the quality bonus to three star plans for a three year period through 2014 star ratings issued by cms in october 2012 indicated that 99 of our medicare advantage members are now in plans that will qualify for quality bonus payments in 2014 up from 98 in 2013 further the percentage of our medicare advantage members in plans with an overall star rating of four or more stars including one five star plan increased to 40 plans that earn an overall star rating of five are immediately eligible to enroll members year round beginning in 2015 plans must have a star rating of four or higher to qualify for bonus money notwithstanding successful historical efforts to improve our star ratings and other quality measures for 2012 and 2013 and the continuation of such efforts there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in future years accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

as discussed above implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the health insurance reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation implementation and timing of these changes which we expect to occur over the next several years the health insurance reform legislation will change the way we do business potentially impacting our pricing benefit design product mix geographic mix and distribution channels in particular implementing regulations and related guidance are forthcoming on various aspects of the minimum benefit ratio requirement’s applicability to medicare including aggregation credibility thresholds and its application to prescription drug plans the response of other companies to the health insurance reform legislation and adjustments to their offerings if any could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets it is reasonably possible that the health insurance reform legislation and related regulations as well as future legislative changes in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our 

  

ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows if the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments including a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee were imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments such as through the reduction of our operating costs or adjustments to premium pricing or benefit design there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our health and wellbeing services segment primarily pharmacy behavioral health and provider services to our retail and employer group customers and are described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

consolidated 

 

  

  summary 

net income was 12 billion or 747 per diluted common share in 2012 compared to 14 billion or 846 per diluted common share in 2011 primarily due to lower operating results in the retail segment partially offset by improved operating performance in the health and wellbeing services segment during 2012 we experienced a significant increase in the retail segment benefit ratio primarily associated with our individual 

  

medicare advantage products primarily due to a planned increase in the target benefit ratio associated with positioning for health insurance reform legislation funding changes and minimum benefit ratio requirements and a higher benefit ratio experienced on new membership than the assumptions used in our 2012 medicare bids our diluted earnings per common share for 2012 included 018 per diluted common share for benefits expense related to the settlement of a litigation matter associated with our military services business as well as 011 per diluted common share for benefits expense associated with reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care policies in our other businesses as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased 19 billion or 54 from 2011 to 370 billion for 2012 primarily due to increases in both retail and employer group segment premiums mainly driven by higher average individual and group medicare advantage membership partially offset by lower premiums for our other businesses due to the transition to the new tricare south region contract as discussed previously on april 1 2012 we began delivering services under the new tricare south region contract that the tma awarded to us on february 25 2011 we account for revenues under the new contract net of estimated healthcare costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement and as such there are no premiums recognized under the new contract our previous contract was accounted for similar to our fullyinsured products and as such we recognized premiums under the previous contract average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased 366 million or 269 from 2011 to 17 billion for 2012 primarily due to an increase in service revenue for our other businesses due to the transition to the new tricare south region contract on april 1 2012 and an increase in services revenue in our health and wellbeing services segment from growth in our concentra operations and the acquisition of seniorbridge on july 6 2012

benefits expense 

consolidated benefits expense was 310 billion for 2012 an increase of 22 billion or 75 from 2011 primarily due to a yearoveryear increase in retail and employer group segment benefits expense in 2012 primarily driven by an increase in the average number of medicare members partially offset by a decrease in benefits expense for other businesses primarily due to the transition to the new administrative services only tricare south region contract on april 1 2012 we do not record benefits expense under the new contract our previous contract was accounted for similar to our fullyinsured products and as such we recorded benefits expense under the previous contract retail segment benefits expense increased 33 billion or 188 from 2011 to 2012 and employer group segment benefits expense increased 12 billion or 165 from 2011 to 2012 we experienced favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 257 million in 2012 and 372 million in 2011 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2012 was 837 increasing 160 basis points from the 2011 benefit ratio of 821 primarily driven by increases in both the retail and employer group segments benefit ratios as 

  

described further in our segment results discussion that follows the 115 million decline in favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development from 2011 to 2012 negatively impacted yearoveryear comparisons of the benefit ratio yearoveryear comparisons of the consolidated benefit ratio were favorably impacted by 20 basis points due to the continued growth of our health  wellbeing services segment and the related savings realized on a consolidated basis from providing these services directly to our members at fair market value rather than through a third party 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased 435 million or 81 during 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due an increase in operating costs in our retail segment as a result of medicare advantage growth 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2012 was 151 increasing 30 basis points from the 2011 operating cost ratio of 148 as the negative impact of the new tricare south region contract being accounted for as an administrative services fee only arrangement was partially offset by improved operating leverage 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2012 totaled 295 million an increase of 25 million or 93 from 2011 primarily reflecting depreciation and amortization expense associated with the acquisitions of anvita in the fourth quarter of 2011 arcadian in the first quarter of 2012 seniorbridge in the third quarter of 2012 and other health and wellness businesses during 2012

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased 805 million or 1450 from 2010 to 14 billion for 2011 primarily due to an increase in provider services revenue in our health and wellbeing services segment primarily as a result of the acquisition of concentra on december 21 2010 

investment income

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2011 was 821 declining 80 basis points from the 2010 benefit ratio of 829 primarily driven by a decline in the retail segment benefit ratio and a net charge for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care policies in our other businesses in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 yearoveryear comparisons of the benefit ratio were negatively impacted by the 62 million decline in favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development from 2010 to 2011 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased 10 billion or 232 during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in operating costs in our health and wellbeing segment as a result of the acquisition of concentra on december 21 2010 as well as an increase in operating costs in our retail segment as a result of increased expenses associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership operating costs for 2010 include 147 million for the writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical policies in our retail segment 

  

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2011 was 148 increasing 160 basis points from the 2010 operating cost ratio of 132 the 147 million writedown of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 increased the operating cost ratio 50 basis points for 2010 excluding the impact of the writedown of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 the increase primarily reflects the greater percentage of our revenues derived from concentra acquired december 21 2010 in our health and wellbeing services segment which carries a higher operating cost ratio on external revenues than our other segments as well as an increase in the retail and employer group segment operating cost ratios 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2011 totaled 270 million an increase of 25 million or 102 from 2010 primarily reflecting depreciation and amortization expense associated with our concentra operations acquired on december 21 2010

interest expense was 109 million for 2011 compared to 105 million for 2010 an increase of 4 million or 38 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2011 was 365 compared to the effective tax rate of 372 in 2010 the higher tax rate for 2010 primarily was due to the cumulative adjustment associated with estimating the retrospective aspect of new limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of 500000 per employee as mandated by the health insurance reform legislation see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

pretax income for our other businesses of 84 million for 2011 compared to pretax losses of 2 million for 2010 pretax losses for 2010 include the impact of a net charge of 139 million associated with reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care policies excluding this charge the yearoveryear decline primarily reflects a decrease in pretax income associated with our contract with cms to administer the linet program 

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums services revenue and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent 

cash and cash equivalents decreased to 13 billion at december 31 2012 from 14 billion at december 31 2011 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings enrollment activity and changes in working capital items as discussed below cash flows were positively impacted by medicare enrollment gains in 2012 2011 and 2010 because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months 

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and payments of benefits expense we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable 

  

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 medicare receivables are impacted by revenue growth associated with growth in individual and group medicare membership and the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

military services receivables at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 primarily consisted of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees under our previous tricare south region contract that expired on march 31 2012 the claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the 41 million increase in base receivables for 2011 as compared to 2010 and the 26 million decrease in base receivables for 2010 as compared to 2009 the 409 million decrease in military services receivables from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 primarily resulted from the transition to our new tricare south region contract which we account for similar to an administrative services fee only agreement as such beginning april 1 2012 payments of the federal government’s claims and related reimbursements for the new tricare south region contract are classified with receipts withdrawals from contract deposits as a financing item in our consolidated statements of cash flows military services receivables at december 31 2012 primarily consist of administrative services only fees owed from the federal government for administrative services provided under our new tricare south region contract 

commercial and other receivables for 2012 2011 and 2010 include 166 million 144 million and 109 million respectively of patient services receivables acquired with the acquisition of concentra in december 2010 in addition the allowance for doubtful accounts increased 33 million from 2010 to 2011 the increase in concentra receivables in 2010 and the related allowance in 2011 result from the requirement to record acquired balances at fair value at the acquisition date excluding the receivables acquired with concentra commercial and other receivables reflect the timing of reimbursements from the puerto rico health insurance administration for our medicaid business 

  

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

    the increase in benefits payable in 2012 primarily was due to an increase in ibnr primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth partially offset by a 335 million decrease in the military services benefits payable due to the runout of claims under the previous tricare south region contract that expired on march 31 2012 a decrease in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements and a decrease in the amounts due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff under the new tricare south region contract effective april 1 2012 the federal government retains the risk of the cost of health benefits and related benefit obligation as further described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data the increase in benefits payable in 2011 primarily was due to an increase in processed but unpaid claims including amounts due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff and an increase in military services benefits payable the increase in benefits payable in 2010 primarily was due to an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements as well as an increase in ibnr both primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth partially offset by a decrease in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to the monthend cutoff 

in addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and services fees and payments of benefits expense other working capital items impacting operating cash flows primarily resulted from the timing of payments for the medicare part d risk corridor provisions of our contracts with cms changes in the timing of the collection of pharmacy rebates and the timing of payments for premium rebates associated with minimum benefit ratios required under the health insurance reform legislation 

  

cash flow from investing activities 

cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 1235 million in 2012 226 million in 2011 and 833 million in 2010 primarily related to the metropolitan arcadian seniorbridge and other health and wellness and technology related acquisitions in 2012 anvita and other retail segment acquisitions in 2011 and the concentra acquisition in 2010 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling 320 million in 2012 796 million in 2011 and 756 million in 2010 

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our provider services operations including medical and administrative facility improvements necessary for activities such as the provision of care to members claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 410 million in 2012 346 million in 2011 and 222 million in 2010 with 2012 and 2011 reflecting increased spending associated with growth in our provider services and pharmacy businesses in our health and wellbeing services segment excluding acquisitions we expect total capital expenditures in 2013 in a range of approximately 425 million to 450 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

in december 2012 we issued 600 million of 315 senior notes due december 1 2022 and 400 million of 4625 senior notes due december 1 2042 our net proceeds reduced for the discount and cost of the offering were 990 million we used the proceeds from the offering primarily to finance the acquisition of metropolitan including the retirement of metropolitan’s indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses 

in march 2012 we repaid without penalty junior subordinated longterm debt of 36 million 

receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were 341 million less than claims payments during 2012 378 million less than claim payments during 2011 and 237 million less than claims payments during 2010 under our new administrative services only tricare south region contract that began april 1 2012 health care cost payments for which we do not assume risk exceeded reimbursements from the federal government by 56 million in 2012 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

we repurchased 625 million shares for 460 million in 2012 68 million shares for 492 million in 2011 and 199 million shares for 100 million in 2010 under share repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 58 million in 2012 49 million in 2011 and 8 million in 2010 

during 2012 we paid dividends to stockholders of 165 million as discussed further below we paid dividends to stockholders of 82 million during 2011 no dividends were paid during 2010 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2012 2011 and 2010 primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in book overdraft 

future sources and uses of liquidity 

dividends 

in april 2011 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and may be adjusted as business or market conditions change 

  

the following table provides details of dividend payments in 2011 and 2012 

 

 in october 2012 the board of directors declared a cash dividend of 026 per share that was paid on january 25 2013 for an aggregate amount of 42 million to stockholders of record as of the close of business on december 31 2012 

stock repurchase authorization 

in april 2012 the board of directors replaced its previously approved share repurchase authorization of up to 1 billion of which 461 million remained unused with the current authorization for repurchases of up to 1 billion of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans the current authorization will expire june 30 2014 under this share repurchase authorization shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases or in privatelynegotiated transactions subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume pricing and timing as of february 1 2013 the remaining authorized amount under the current authorization totaled 640 million 

senior notes 

in december 2012 we issued 600 million of 315 senior notes due december 1 2022 and 400 million of 4625 senior notes due december 1 2042 our net proceeds reduced for the discount and cost of the offering were 990 million we used the proceeds from the offering primarily to finance the acquisition of metropolitan including the retirement of metropolitan’s indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses we previously issued 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 300 million of 630 senior notes due august 1 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 the 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded in addition our 720 815 315 and 4625 senior notes contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances all six series of our senior notes which are unsecured may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified makewhole amount our senior notes are more fully discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

our 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving agreement expires in november 2016 under the credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread the libor spread currently 120 basis points varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 875 to 1475 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 175 basis points may fluctuate between 125 and 275 basis points depending upon our credit ratings the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option 

  

the terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds in addition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of 66 billion at december 31 2012 and a maximum leverage ratio of 301 we are in compliance with the financial covenants with actual net worth of 88 billion and actual leverage ratio of 111 as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of december 31 2012 in addition the credit agreement includes an uncommitted 250 million incremental loan facility 

at december 31 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement we have outstanding letters of credit of 5 million secured under the credit agreement no amounts have been drawn on these letters of credit accordingly as of december 31 2012 we had 995 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement 

other longterm borrowings 

in march 2012 we called without penalty junior subordinated debt of 36 million prior to repayment the junior subordinated debt bore a fixed annual interest rate of 802 payable quarterly until 2012 and then payable at a floating rate based on libor plus 310 basis points 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements acquisitions future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2012 was bbb according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 2 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 8 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry humana inc our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company were 346 million at december 31 2012 and 494 million at december 31 2011 our subsidiaries paid dividends to the parent of 12 billion in 2012 11 billion in 2011 and 747 million in 2010 refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i – parent company financial information as described in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health insurance reform” the naic is continuing discussions regarding the accounting for the insurance industry premiumbased assessment required by the health insurance reform legislation and may require accrual and associated subsidiary funding consideration for the first two years of the assessment in 2014 followed by annual accruals thereafter the naic guidance is contradictory to final gaap guidance issued by the fasb in july 2011 which requires annual accrual of the insurance industry premiumbased assessment in the year in which it is payable 

  

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities or ordinary dividends is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to for example premium volume and product mix 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements vary significantly at the state level our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately 51 billion and 47 billion as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements excluding puerto rico subsidiaries the amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2013 is approximately 911 million in the aggregate this compares to ordinary dividends that were able to be paid in 2012 of approximately 860 million we expect the amount of dividends to be paid to our parent company in 2013 to approximate the amount of ordinary dividends 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2012 as follows 

 

  

      

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2012 we were not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

government contracts 

our medicare products which accounted for approximately 72 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily consisted of products covered under the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan contracts with the federal government these contracts are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare products have been renewed for 2013 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2013 have been approved 

cms uses a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under this model rates paid to medicare advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s original medicare program under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses the diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans which cms adjusts for coding pattern differences between the health plans and the government feeforservice program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on these providers to document appropriately all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims 

  

cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected medicare advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data we refer to these audits as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical records in an attempt to validate provider medical record documentation and coding practices which influence the calculation of premium payments to medicare advantage plans 

on february 24 2012 cms released a “notice of final payment error calculation methodology for part c medicare advantage risk adjustment data validation radv contractlevel audits” the payment error calculation methodology provides that in calculating the economic impact of audit results for a medicare advantage contract if any the results of the audit sample will be extrapolated to the entire medicare advantage contract based upon a comparison to “benchmark” audit data in the government feeforservice program this comparison to the government program benchmark audit is necessary to determine the economic impact if any of audit results because the government program data set including any attendant errors that are present in that data set provides the basis for medicare advantage plans risk adjustment to payment rates cms already makes other adjustments to payment rates based on a comparison of coding pattern differences between medicare advantage plans and the government feeforservice program data such as for frequency of coding for certain diagnoses in medicare advantage plan data versus the government program data set 

the final methodology including the first application of extrapolated audit results to determine audit settlements is expected to be applied to the next round of radv contract level audits to be conducted on 2011 premium payments selected medicare advantage contracts will be notified of an audit at some point after the close of the final reconciliation for the payment year being audited the final reconciliation occurs in august of the calendar year following the payment year 

estimated audit settlements are recorded as a reduction of premiums revenue in our consolidated statements of income based upon available information during 2012 we completed internal contract level audits of certain contracts based on the radv audit methodology prescribed by cms included in these internal contract level audits was an audit of our private feeforservice business which we used to represent a proxy of the benchmark audit data in the government feeforservice program which has not yet been released we based our accrual of estimated audit settlements for contract years 2011 the first year that application of extrapolated audit results is applicable and 2012 on the results of these internal contract level audits estimates derived from these results were not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows however as indicated we are awaiting additional guidance from cms regarding the benchmark audit data in the government feeforservice program and the identification of our specific medicare advantage contracts that will be selected for audit accordingly we cannot determine whether such audits will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

at december 31 2012 our military services business which accounted for approximately 3 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily consisted of the tricare south region contract on april 1 2012 we began delivering services under the new tricare south region contract that the tma awarded to us on february 25 2011 the new 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2017 is subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year during its term at the government’s option the tma has notified us of its intent to exercise its option to extend the tricare south region contract through march 31 2014 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 3 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico effective october 1 2010 as amended in may 2011 the puerto rico health insurance administration or prhia awarded us contracts for the east southeast and southwest regions for a threeyear term through june 30 2013 

the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding 

  

increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefits expense and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefits expense recognition 

benefits expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 

 

 military services benefits payable primarily relates to our previous tricare south region contract that expired on march 31 2012 and primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which were in turn reimbursed by the federal government as further described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data this amount was generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government as more fullydescribed in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “cash flow from operating activities” under the new tricare south region contract effective april 1 2012 the federal government retains the risk of the cost of health benefits and related benefit obligation as further described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

  

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing changes in medical management processes product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including recoveries of overpayments receipt cycle times claim inventory levels outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors claim payments to providers for services rendered are often net of overpayment recoveries for claims paid previously as contractually allowed claim overpayment recoveries can result from many different factors including retroactive enrollment activity audits of provider billings andor payment errors changes in patterns of claim overpayment recoveries can be unpredictable and result in completion factor volatility as they often impact older dates of service the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last several years if claims are submitted or processed on a faster slower pace than prior periods the actual claim may be more less complete than originally estimated using our completion factors which may result in reserves that are higher lower than required 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services new higher priced technologies and medical procedures and new prescription drugs and therapies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes the tort liability system increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population lifestyle changes including diet and smoking catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

  

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2012 data 

 

  

   the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefits expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 

 

   

the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefits expense ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 

 

  

 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant there was favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years of 257 million in 2012 372 million in 2011 and 434 million in 2010 the table below details our favorable medical claims reserve development related to prior fiscal years by segment for 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2012 2011 and 2010 primarily reflects the consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions in addition the favorable medical claims reserve development for 2011 and 2010 reflect improvements in the claims processing environment and to a lesser extent better than originally estimated utilization the improvements in the claims processing environment benefited all lines of business during 2011 and 2010 but were more significant during 2010 particularly in our medicare private feeforservice line of business as a result of these improvements during 2011 and 2010 we experienced a significant increase in claim overpayment recoveries for claims incurred in prior years primarily as a result of increased audits of provider billings as well as system enhancements that improved the claim recovery functionality in addition in 2010 a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions was a contributing factor we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2012 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

  

benefits expense associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table was as follows for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 the declines in military services benefits payable and benefits expense in 2012 relate to the transition to the new tricare south region contract on april 1 2012 which is accounted for as an administrative services only contract as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data our previous tricare contract that expired on march 31 2012 contained provisions where we shared the risk with the federal government for the cost of health benefits therefore the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for tricare benefits payable was reduced substantially by the federal government’s share of the risk the net change in income from operations as determined retrospectively after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period was an increase of approximately 2 million for 2011 and a decrease of approximately 14 million for 2010 

future policy benefits payable of 19 billion and 17 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits 

future policy benefits payable include 11 billion at december 31 2012 and 938 million at december 31 2011 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg acquisition these amounts include 119 million at december 31 2012 and 47 million at december 31 2011 associated with amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income for an additional liability that would exist on our closedblock of longterm care policies if unrealized gains on the sale of the investments backing such products had been realized and the proceeds reinvested at then current yields amounts charged to accumulated other comprehensive income are net of applicable deferred taxes 

during 2012 we recorded a change in estimate associated with future policy benefits payable for our longterm care block resulting in additional benefits expense of 29 million and a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable this change in estimate was based on current claim experience demonstrating an increase in the length of the time policyholders already in payment status remained in such status future policy benefits payable was increased to cover future payments to policyholders currently in payment status 

longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual interest rates morbidity rates and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold to the extent premium rate increases andor loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required during 2010 certain states 

  

approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our longterm care block that were significantly below our acquisition date assumptions based on these actions by the states combined with lower interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition date assumptions we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our longterm care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during 2010 we recorded 139 million of additional benefits expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 170 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 31 million included in other longterm assets in addition future policy benefits payable include amounts of 220 million at december 31 2012 and of 224 million at december 31 2011 which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per employee basis for each month of coverage based on the type of coverage purchased single to family coverage options our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premiums revenue and administrative services only or aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay and beginning january 1 2011 for estimated rebates to policyholders under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health insurance reform legislation we estimate these policyholder rebates by projecting calendar year minimum benefit ratios for the individual small group and large group markets as defined by the health insurance reform legislation using a methodology prescribed by the department of health and human services separately by state and legal entity estimated calendar year rebates recognized ratably during the year are revised each period to reflect current experience enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium remittances from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from cms for our medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores derived from medical diagnoses for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare part d provisions 

we cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d under multiple contracts with cms the payments we receive monthly from cms and members which are determined from our annual bid represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage we recognize premiums revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract our cms payment is subject to 

  

risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions in addition receipts for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as receipts for certain discounts on brand name prescription drugs in the coverage gap represent payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk 

the risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period accordingly this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience we record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or longterm in the consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of expected settlement 

the estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain at period end including member eligibility and risk adjustment score differences with cms as well as pharmacy rebates from manufacturers these factors have an offsetting effect on changes in the risk corridor estimate in 2012 we paid 131 million and in january 2013 we paid 158 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2011 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 286 million at december 31 2011 in 2011 we paid 380 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2010 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 345 million at december 31 2010 the net liability associated with the 2012 risk corridor estimate which will be settled in 2013 was 194 million at december 31 2012 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent funding from cms for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and related settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year beginning in 2011 the health reform legislation mandates consumer discounts of 50 on brand name prescription drugs for part d plan participants in the coverage gap these discounts are funded by cms and pharmaceutical manufacturers while we administer the application of these funds we account for these subsidies and discounts as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize premiums revenue or benefits expense for these subsidies or discounts receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period gross financing receipts were 35 billion and gross financing withdrawals were 38 billion during 2012 cms subsidy and brand name prescription drug discount activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2012 was 635 million to other current assets and 77 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the brand name prescription drug discounts and risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year we continue to revise our estimates with respect to the risk corridor provisions based on subsequent period pharmacy claims data 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary 

  

diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans rates paid to medicare advantage plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s original medicare program we generally rely on providers including certain providers in our network who are our employees to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on medical diagnoses for our membership the riskadjustment model is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” 

military services 

in 2012 revenues derived from our military services business represented approximately 3 of total premiums and services revenue military services premiums and services revenue primarily is derived from our tricare south region contract with the department of defense or dod on april 1 2012 we began delivering services under a new tricare south region contract with the dod under the new contract we provide administrative services including offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs claim processing customer service enrollment and other services while the federal government retains all of the risk of the cost of health benefits under the terms of the new tricare south region contract we do not record premiums revenue or benefits expense in our consolidated statements of income related to these health care costs and related reimbursements instead we account for revenues under the new contract net of estimated health care costs similar to an administrative services fee only agreement the new contract includes fixed administrative services fees and incentive fees and penalties administrative services fees are recognized as services are performed 

our tricare members are served by both innetwork and outofnetwork providers in accordance with the new contract we pay health care costs related to these services to the providers and are subsequently reimbursed by the dod for such payments we account for the payments associated with these health care costs and the related reimbursements under deposit accounting in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity under receipts withdrawals from contract deposits in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the first nine months of the new contract april 1 2012 to december 31 2012 health care cost payments were 21 billion exceeding reimbursements of 20 billion by 56 million 

our previous tricare south region contract that expired on march 31 2012 provided a financial interest in the underlying health care cost therefore we reported revenues on a gross basis we shared the risk with the federal government for the cost of health benefits incurred under our previous contract earning more revenue or incurring additional cost based on the variance of actual health care costs from an annually negotiated target health care cost as described below tricare revenues consisted generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which were in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative services fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment and other services we recognized the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage was provided health care services reimbursements were recognized as revenue in the period health services were provided administrative services fees were recognized as revenue in the period services were performed 

as indicated above our previous tricare south region contained provisions where we shared the risk with the federal government for the cost of health benefits annually we negotiated a target health care cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determined an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost was shared we earned more revenue or incurred additional costs based on the variance of actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we received 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling 

  

that limited the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we paid 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limited the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurred 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applied we deferred the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount was determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured we estimated and recognized unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefits expense 

the military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

patient services 

patient services revenue associated with provider services in our health and wellbeing services segment primarily related to concentra acquired december 21 2010 patient services revenue includes 1 workers’ compensation injury care and related services and 2 other healthcare services related to employer needs or statutory requirements patient services revenues are recognized in the period services are provided to the customer when the sales price is fixed or determinable and are net of contractual allowances 

the provider reimbursement methods for workers’ compensation injury care and related services vary on a statebystate basis most states have fee schedules pursuant to which all healthcare providers are uniformly reimbursed the fee schedules are determined by each state and generally prescribe the maximum amounts that may be reimbursed for a designated procedure in the states without fee schedules healthcare providers are reimbursed based on usual customary and reasonable fees charged in the particular state in which the services are provided we include billings for services in revenue net of allowance for estimated differences between list prices and allowable fee schedule rates or amounts allowed as usual customary and reasonable as applicable 

revenue for other healthcare services is recognized on a feeforservice basis at estimated collectible amounts at the time services are rendered our fees are determined in advance for each type of service performed 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 98 billion or 49 of total assets at december 31 2012 and 95 billion or 53 of total assets at december 31 2011 debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2012 and at december 31 2011 the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2012 and 2011 

 

   

approximately 94 of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2012 most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 311 million at december 31 2012 and 332 million at december 31 2011 these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established taxexempt municipal securities that were not prerefunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of us states and local municipalities as well as special revenue bonds general obligation bonds which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer accounted for 11 billion of these municipals in the portfolio special revenue bonds issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities water and sewer transportation or education and supported by the revenues of that project accounted for 17 billion of these municipals our general obligation bonds are diversified across the us with no individual state exceeding 11 in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our taxexempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 627 million and 634 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively of taxexempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent weighted average sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa 

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was 2 million at december 31 2012 and 3 million at december 31 2011 there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio 

the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 228 at december 31 2012 and 193 at december 31 2011 

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2012 

 

 under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we 

  

have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

the recoverability of our nonagency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities is supported by factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements these residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities at december 31 2012 primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit support with over 99 of the collateral consisting of prime loans the weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgagebacked securities was aa at december 31 2012 

several european countries including spain italy ireland portugal and greece have been subject to credit deterioration due to weakness in their economic and fiscal situations we have no direct exposure to sovereign issuances of these five countries 

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2012 remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased at december 31 2012 we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2012 

there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2012 2011 or 2010 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2012 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 28 of total assets and 62 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 23 and 51 respectively at december 31 2011 

  

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

we use a twostep process to review goodwill for impairment the first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the ultimate outcome of the health insurance reform legislation the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill 

beginning with 2012 we are allowed to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we did not elect to use the qualitative approach in 2012 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense prior to 2009 under interest rate swap agreements we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements in 2008 we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2012 or december 31 2011 

  

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa at december 31 2012 our net unrealized position improved 203 million from a net unrealized gain position of 525 million at december 31 2011 to a net unrealized gain position of 728 million at december 31 2012 at december 31 2012 we had gross unrealized losses of 8 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased and as such there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2012 while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 40 years as of december 31 2012 and 39 years as of december 31 2011 based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 443 million 

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2012 and 2011 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points four times and have changed by less than 100 basis points five times

this annual report on form 10k or 2011 form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a – risk factors in this 2011 form 10k for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business 

health insurance reform 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

certain significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation include among others mandated coverage requirements rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare 

  

advantage premiums the establishment of statebased exchanges coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers an annual insurance industry premiumbased assessment and a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee implementation dates of the health insurance reform legislation vary from september 30 2010 to as late as 2018 the health insurance reform legislation is discussed more fully in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health insurance reform” 

2011 business segment realignment 

during the first quarter of 2011 we realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model as a result we reassessed and changed our operating and reportable segments in the first quarter of 2011 to reflect management’s view of the business and to align our external financial reporting with our new operating and internal financial reporting model historical segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of this change our new reportable segments and the basis for determining those segments are discussed below 

business segments 

we currently manage our business with three reportable segments retail employer group and health and wellbeing services in addition we include businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles in an other businesses category these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

the retail segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products marketed directly to individuals the employer group segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups the health and wellbeing services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including primary care pharmacy integrated wellness and home care services the other businesses category consists of our military services primarily our tricare south region contract medicaid and closedblock longterm care businesses as well as our contract with cms to administer the limited income newly eligible transition program or the linet program 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our health and wellbeing services segment primarily pharmacy and behavioral health services to our retail and employer group customers intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at the corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations 

  

our products 

our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted these products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage health maintenance organizations or hmos generally require a referral from the member’s primary care physician before seeing certain specialty physicians preferred provider organizations or ppos provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral however ppos generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the ppo’s network point of service or pos plans combine the advantages of hmo plans with the flexibility of ppo plans in general pos plans allow members to choose at the time medical services are needed to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network in addition we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including pharmacy primary care integrated wellness and home care services the discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments 

our retail segment products 

this segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows the following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the retail segment by product for the year ended december 31 2011 

 

 individual medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 25 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states we have a geographically diverse membership base that provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care we believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and 

  

part b coverage under original medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as original medicare as an alternative to original medicare in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under original medicare our medicare advantage plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

individual medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original medicare typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions disease management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on january 1 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in most cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

our medicare pffs plans generally have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to original medicare payment rates on january 1 2011 most of our members enrolled in pffs plans transitioned to networkedbased ppo type products due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits to establish the riskadjustment payments under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

at december 31 2011 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 1640300 individual medicare advantage members under our individual medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 362100 members these florida 

  

contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately 56 billion which represented approximately 31 of our individual medicare advantage premiums revenue or 15 of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage products have been renewed for 2012 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2012 have been approved

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 30 million eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2011 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense of these eligible beneficiaries 13 million were tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries and seniors over the age of 65 for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract the original 5year south region contract expired on march 31 2009 and was extended through march 31 2012 on february 25 2011 the department of defense tricare management activity or tma awarded the new tricare south region contract to us which we expect to take effect on april 1 2012 the new 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2017 is subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year during its term at the government’s option 

  

under the current tricare south region contract any variance from the negotiated target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments 

the tricare south region contract represents approximately 97 of total military services premiums and services revenue 

medicaid 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a statespecific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

our medicaid business consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico 

linet 

in 2010 we began to administer cms’s linet program this program allows individuals who receive medicare’s lowincome subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a medicare part d plan cms temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both medicare and medicaid into the linet program and subsequently transitions each member into a medicare part d plan that may or may not be a humana medicare plan 

closed block of longterm care insurance

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2011 by market and product 

 

  

 provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have 

  

arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met our hospitalist programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

the budget control act of 2011 established a twelvemember joint committee of congress known as the joint select committee on deficit reduction to propose legislation to reduce the united states federal deficit by 15 trillion for fiscal years 20122021 the failure of the joint select committee on deficit reduction to achieve a targeted deficit reduction by december 23 2011 triggered an automatic reduction including aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 percent per fiscal year at this time it is unclear how this automatic reduction may be applied to various medicare healthcare programs or the timing when such reductions may begin we expect that if such reductions were to occur there would be a corresponding substantial reduction in our obligations to providers due to the uncertainty around the timing or application of any such reductions there can be no assurances that we could completely offset any reductions to the medicare healthcare programs applied by the budget control act of 2011 

capitation 

for approximately 10 of our medical membership including 33 of our total medicare advantage membership at december 31 2011 we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefit ratio the benefit ratio measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums revenue providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and specialist physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

for approximately 86 of our medical membership including 190 of our total medicare advantage membership at december 31 2011 we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby 

  

physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for services rendered we share hospital and other benefit expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

 capitation expense as a percentage of total benefit expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

physicians participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information a committee composed of a peer group of physicians reviews the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and the utilization review accreditation commission or urac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

  

ncqa performs reviews of our compliance with standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in all of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos markets with enough history and membership except puerto rico and for many of our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 2000 sales representatives as well as approximately 900 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare products in our retail segment by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with state farm ® and united services automobile association or usaa commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure approved by cms for our retail segment we also offer commercial health insurance and specialty products directly to individuals 

in our employer group segment individuals may become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we also sell group medicare advantage products through large employers 

for both our retail and employer group segments at december 31 2011 we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 1100 licensed employees to sell our commercial insurance products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

underwriting 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions beginning in 2014 the health insurance reform legislation requires all individual and group health plans to guarantee issuance and renew coverage without preexisting condition exclusions or healthstatus rating adjustments 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

  

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in the section entitled “risk factors” in this 2011 form 10k 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of certain material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see the section entitled “risk factors” in this 2011 form 10k 

other 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and to our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 40000 employees including approximately 2050 medical professionals working under management agreements between concentra and affiliated physicianowned associations we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages

 item 1a risk factors tableend if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns these estimates however involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in payment patterns and medical cost trends 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including life insurance annuities health and longterm care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables as modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time 

  

each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 938 million at december 31 2011 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg america corporation acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions additional future adjustments to reserves could be required during the fourth quarter of 2010 certain states approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our longterm care block that were significantly below our acquisition date assumptions based on these actions by the states combined with lower interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition date assumptions we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our longterm care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded 139 million of additional benefit expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 170 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 31 million included in other longterm assets 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in medicare products 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position us for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare 

  

programs including our hmo and ppo products as well as our standalone pdp products we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia 

the growth of our medicare products is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare products in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in medicare products there is significant concentration of our revenues in medicare products with approximately 65 of our total premiums and services revenue in 2011 generated from our medicare products these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

recently enacted health insurance reform legislation created a federal medicaremedicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles this medicaremedicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects to experiment with better coordination of care between medicare and medicaid depending upon the results of those demonstration projects cms may change the way in which dual eligibles are serviced if we are unable to implement our strategic initiatives to address the dual eligibles opportunity or if our initiatives are not successful at attracting or retaining dual eligible members our business may be materially adversely affected 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial products such as aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including humanavitality and other wellness products expansion of our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products the adoption of new technologies development of adjacent businesses and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts including the 2010 acquisition of concentra inc 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives including outsourcing certain business functions that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems to protect our proprietary rights to our systems or to defend against cybersecurity attacks our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we took steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

  

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents providers and other stakeholders through webenabled technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

a cybersecurity attack that bypasses our information technology or it security systems causing a security breach may lead to a material disruption of our information technology business systems andor the loss of business information if a cybersecurity attack were to be successful we could be adversely affected due to the theft destruction loss misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our it systems or negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers brokers agents providers and other stakeholders 

there can be no assurance that our it process will successfully improve existing systems develop new systems to support our expanding operations integrate new systems protect our proprietary information defend against cybersecurity attacks or improve service levels in addition there can be no assurance that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data or to defend against cybersecurity attacks may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business may be materially adversely impacted by cms’s adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnoses commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the number of codes utilized we may be required to incur significant expenses in implementing the new coding set if we do not adequately implement the new coding set our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

we are involved in various legal actions and governmental and internal investigations including without limitation an ongoing internal investigation and litigation and government requests for information related to certain aspects of our florida subsidiary operations any of which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions securities laws claims and tort claims 

  

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see “legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters” in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty 

  

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs these programs accounted for approximately 78 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

 

  

  

 effective october 1 2010 the prhia awarded us three contracts for the east southeast and southwest regions for a one year term with two options to extend the contracts for an additional term of up to one year exercisable at the sole discretion of the prhia the loss of these contracts or significant changes in the puerto rico medicaid program as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

   

  

 cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected medicare advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data these audits are referred to herein as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to medicare advantage plans to date six humana contracts have been selected by cms for radv audits for the 2007 contract year consisting of one “pilot” audit and five “targeted” audits for humana plans 

on december 21 2010 cms posted a description of the agency’s proposed radv sampling and payment adjustment calculation methodology to its website and invited public comment noting that cms may revise its sampling and payment error calculation methodology based upon the comments received we believe the audit and payment adjustment methodology proposed by cms is fundamentally flawed and actuarially unsound in essence in making the comparison referred to above cms relies on two interdependent sets of data to set payment rates for medicare advantage ma plans 1 fee for service ffs data from the government’s original medicare program and 2 ma data the proposed methodology would review medical records for only one set of data ma data while not performing the same exercise on the other set ffs data however because these two sets of data are inextricably linked we believe cms must audit and validate both of them before extrapolating any potential radv audit results in order to ensure that any resulting payment adjustment is accurate we believe that the social security act under which the payment model was established requires the consistent use of these data sets in determining riskadjusted payments to ma plans furthermore our payment received from cms as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members is based on bids that did not by cms design include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments we believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after cms acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums 

cms has received public comments including our comments and comments from other industry participants and the american academy of actuaries which expressed concerns about the failure to appropriately compare the two sets of data on february 3 2011 cms issued a statement that it was closely evaluating the comments it has received on this matter and anticipates making changes to the proposed methodology based on input it has received although we are unable to predict the extent of changes that they may make 

we believe that the proposed methodology is actuarially unsound and in violation of the social security act we intend to defend that position vigorously however if cms moves forward with implementation of the proposed methodology without changes to adequately address the data 

  

inconsistency issues described above it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from the medicare advantage program and therefore our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 329 million at december 31 2011 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 

  

   

  

 recently enacted health insurance reform including the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio on insured products and particularly how the ratio may apply to medicare plans lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows in addition if the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments including a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee were imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments such as through the reduction of our operating costs there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the health insurance reform legislation have been issued to date by the department of health and human services hhs the department of labor the treasury department and the national association of insurance commissioners there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

the provisions of the health insurance reform legislation include among others imposing significant new nondeductible federal premium taxes and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage 

  

payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premiums revenue to be expended on medical costs for insured products and particularly how the ratio may apply to medicare advantage and possibly prescription drug plans additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health insurance reform legislation also specifies required benefit designs limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants establishes statebased exchanges for individuals and small employers with up to 100 employees coupled with programs designed to spread risk among insurers and expands eligibility for medicaid programs in addition the law will significantly increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers health plans and individuals beginning in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare implementation dates of the provisions of the health insurance reform legislation generally vary from september 23 2010 to as late as 2018 

implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation the implementation of the individual mandate as well as medicaid expansion in the health insurance reform legislation are also being considered by the us supreme court seeking to have all or portions of the health insurance reform legislation declared unconstitutional we cannot predict the results of these proceedings congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the health insurance reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation implementation and timing of these changes which we expect to occur over the next several years the health insurance reform legislation could change the way we do business potentially impacting our pricing benefit design product mix geographic mix and distribution channels in particular implementing regulations and related guidance are forthcoming on various aspects of the minimum benefit ratio requirement’s applicability to medicare including aggregation credibility thresholds and its possible application to prescription drug plans the response of other companies to health insurance reform legislation and adjustments to their offerings if any could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level it is reasonably possible that the health insurance reform legislation and related regulations as well as future legislative changes in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health insurance reform legislation our business may be materially adversely affected in addition if the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments including a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee were imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments such as through the reduction of our operating costs there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows 

the health care industry in general and health insurance are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

  

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans 

the hitech act one part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 significantly broadened the scope of the privacy and security regulations of hipaa among other requirements the hitech act mandates individual notification in the event of a breach of unsecured individually identifiable health information provides enhanced penalties for hipaa violations and grants enforcement authority to states’ attorneys general in addition to the hhs office of civil rights on october 30 2009 hhs issued an interim final rule implementing amendments to the enforcement regulations under hipaa on july 14 2010 hhs issued a proposed rule containing modifications to privacy standards security standards and enforcement actions in addition hhs is currently in the process of finalizing regulations addressing security breach notification requirements hhs initially released an interim final rule for breach notification requirements on august 24 2009 hhs then drafted a final rule which was submitted to office of management and budget but subsequently withdrawn by hhs on july 29 2010 currently the interim final rule remains in effect but the withdrawal suggests that when hhs issues the final rule the requirements for how covered entities should respond in the event of a potential security breach involving protected health information are likely to be more onerous than those contained in the interim final rule 

in addition there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns including unauthorized access or theft of personal information state statutes and regulations vary from state to state and could impose additional penalties violations of hipaa or applicable federal or state laws or regulations could subject us to significant criminal or civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa and other privacy regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort an investigation or initiation of civil or criminal actions could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to the us department of health and human services in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to 

  

comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires the us department of health and human services to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements 

workers’ compensation laws and regulations 

in performing services for the workers’ compensation industry through our subsidiary concentra inc we must comply with applicable state workers’ compensation laws workers’ compensation laws generally require employers to assume financial responsibility for medical costs lost wages and related legal costs of workrelated illnesses and injuries these laws generally establish the rights of workers to receive benefits and to appeal benefit denials prohibit charging medical copayments or deductibles to employees may restrict employers’ rights to select healthcare providers or direct an injured employee to a specific provider to receive nonemergency workers’ compensation medical care and may include special requirements for physicians providing nonemergency care for workers’ compensation patients including requiring registration with the state agency governing workers’ compensation as well as special continuing education and training licensing and other regulatory requirements to the extent that we are governed by these regulations we may be subject to additional licensing requirements financial oversight and procedural standards for beneficiaries and providers 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

as a corporate entity humana inc is not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiary concentra inc limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under management agreements between concentra and its affiliated physicianowned professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations including arrangements with concentra’s affiliated professional groups comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by 

  

expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment including those governing the management and disposal of infectious medical waste and other waste generated at our subsidiary concentra’s occupational healthcare centers and the cleanup of contamination if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate increases delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

  

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately 47 billion and 43 billion as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements the amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2012 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately 970 million in the aggregate this compares to dividends that were able to be paid in 2011 without prior regulatory approval of approximately 740 million 

any failure to manage operating costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our operating costs impacts our profitability while we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products investments in health and wellbeing product offerings expansion into new specialty markets acquisitions new taxes and assessments including the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments under health insurance reform legislation such as the threeyear commercial reinsurance fee and implementation of regulatory requirements may occur from time to time 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our operating costs in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously in 2011 we acquired md care inc and anvita inc and in 2010 we acquired concentra inc the failure to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of our acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may also be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician 

  

or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy business competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs and internet companies as well as other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy in addition some states have proposed laws to regulate online pharmacies and we may be subject to this legislation if it is passed federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations pharmacies must register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailorder pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost recent events have raised 

  

uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs regulators have conducted investigations into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

  

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under recent regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us economy continues to experience a period of slow economic growth and high unemployment we have closely monitored the impact that this volatile economy is having on our operations workforce reductions have caused corresponding membership losses in our fullyinsured commercial group business continued weakness in the us economy and any continued high unemployment may materially adversely affect our medical membership results of operations financial position and cash flows 

additionally the continued weakness of the us economy has adversely affected the budget of individual states and of the federal government this could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military services and medicaid programs and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and other care increasing the costs of claims expenses submitted to us 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthan temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

  

certain european union member states have total fiscal obligations greater than their respective gross domestic products this imbalance has caused investor concern over such countries ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth currently the european debt crisis has caused credit spreads to widen and liquidity to tighten in the fixed income debt markets a weaker european economy may transcend europe cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of european financial institutions and the stability of european member economies and likewise adversely affect usbased financial institutions the stability of the global financial markets and the us economy we have no direct exposure to sovereign issuances of spain italy ireland portugal or greece 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and to refinance or repay debt however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

given the current economic climate our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility 

over the past three years the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility companyspecific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have contributed to this volatility our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could materially reduce our stock price in addition broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend executive overview 

general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana is a leading health care company that offers a wide range of insurance products and health and wellness services that incorporate an integrated approach to lifelong wellbeing by leveraging the strengths of our core businesses we believe that we can better explore opportunities for existing and emerging adjacencies in health care that can further enhance wellness opportunities for the millions of people across the nation with whom we have relationships 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premiums revenue represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the operating cost ratio which is computed by taking total operating costs as a percentage of total revenue less investment income represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

2011 business segment realignment 

during the first quarter of 2011 we realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model as a result we reassessed and changed our operating and reportable segments in the first quarter of 2011 to reflect management’s view of the business and to align our external financial reporting with our new operating and internal financial reporting model historical segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of this change our new reportable segments and the basis for determining those segments are discussed below 

business segments 

we currently manage our business with three reportable segments retail employer group and health and wellbeing services in addition we include businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles in an other businesses category these segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on wellbeing solutions for our health plans and other customers as described below these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer to assess performance and allocate resources 

the retail segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products marketed directly to individuals the employer group segment consists of medicare and commercial fullyinsured medical and specialty health insurance benefits including dental vision and other supplemental health and financial protection products as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups the health and wellbeing services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness including primary care pharmacy integrated wellness and home care services the other businesses category consists of our military services primarily our tricare south region contract medicaid and closedblock longterm care businesses as well as our contract with cms to administer the linet program 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our health and wellbeing services segment primarily pharmacy and behavioral health services to our retail and employer group customers intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation members served by our segments often 

  

utilize the same provider networks enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we allocate most operating expenses to our segments assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations interest expense on corporate debt and certain other corporate expenses these items are managed at the corporate level these corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations 

seasonality 

our retail segment offers medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program these plans provide varying degrees of coverage our quarterly retail segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the pdp benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affects the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

our employer group segment also experiences seasonality in the benefit ratio pattern however the effect is opposite of the retail segment with the employer group’s benefit ratio increasing as fullyinsured members progress through their annual deductible and maximum outofpocket expenses

 health insurance reform 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the health insurance reform legislation have been issued to date by the department of health and human services hhs the department of labor the treasury department and the national association of insurance commissioners there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

implementation dates of the health insurance reform legislation vary from september 23 2010 to as late as 2018 the following outlines certain provisions of the health insurance reform legislation 

 

  

   

  

  

 the health insurance reform legislation also specifies required benefit designs limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants and expands eligibility for medicaid programs in addition the law will significantly increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers health plans and individuals beginning in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described herein 

in addition certain provisions in the health insurance reform legislation tie medicare advantage premiums to the achievement of certain quality performance measures star ratings beginning in 2012 medicare advantage plans with an overall star rating of three or more stars out of five will be eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates initially quality bonuses were limited to the few plans that achieved four or more stars as an overall rating but cms has expanded the quality bonus to three star plans for a three year period through 2014 recent star ratings issued by cms indicated that 98 of our medicare advantage members are now in plans that will qualify for quality bonus payments in 2013 notwithstanding successful efforts to improve our star ratings and other quality measures for 2012 and 2013 and the continuation of such efforts there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining or improving our star ratings in 

  

future years accordingly our plans may not be eligible for full level quality bonuses which could adversely affect the benefits such plans can offer reduce membership andor reduce profit margins 

as discussed above implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation the implementation of the individual mandate as well as medicaid expansion in the health insurance reform legislation are also being considered by the us supreme court seeking to have all or portions of the health insurance reform legislation declared unconstitutional we cannot predict the results of these proceedings congress may also withhold the funding necessary to implement the health insurance reform legislation or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation implementation and timing of these changes which we expect to occur over the next several years the health insurance reform legislation could change the way we do business potentially impacting our pricing benefit design product mix geographic mix and distribution channels in particular implementing regulations and related guidance are forthcoming on various aspects of the minimum benefit ratio requirement’s applicability to medicare including aggregation credibility thresholds and its possible application to prescription drug plans the response of other companies to the health insurance reform legislation and adjustments to their offerings if any could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level it is reasonably possible that the health insurance reform legislation and related regulations as well as future legislative changes in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and operating costs lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows if the new nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments including a threeyear commercial reinsurance fee were imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address these new taxes and assessments such as through the reduction of our operating costs there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our health and wellbeing services segment primarily pharmacy and behavioral health services to our retail and employer group customers and are described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2011 and 2010 

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

consolidated 

 

  

  nm – not meaningful 

summary 

net income was 14 billion or 846 per diluted common share in 2011 compared to 11 billion or 647 per diluted common share in 2010 primarily due to improved operating performance in the retail and health and wellbeing services segments and the negative impact of certain charges described below on 2010 results that did not recur in 2011 share repurchase activity also contributed to the yearoveryear increase in diluted 

earnings per common share our diluted earnings per common share include the beneficial impact of favorable 

  

priorperiod medical claims reserve development of approximately 077 per diluted common share for 2011 compared to 086 per diluted common share for 2010 net income for the 2010 period also included the negative impact of a 147 million 055 per diluted common share writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical policies in our retail segment and a net charge of 139 million 052 per diluted common share for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care policies in our other businesses as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased 24 billion or 73 from 2010 to 351 billion for 2011 primarily due to an increase in retail segment premiums partially offset by a decline in employer group segment premiums the increase in retail segment premiums primarily resulted from higher average individual medicare advantage membership the decrease in employer group segment premiums primarily resulted from lower average fullyinsured commercial group medical membership average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period premiums revenue reflects changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership

consolidated services revenue increased 805 million or 1450 from 2010 to 14 billion for 2011 primarily due to an increase in primary care services revenue in our health and wellbeing services segment primarily as a result of the acquisition of concentra on december 21 2010 

investment income 

investment income totaled 366 million for 2011 an increase of 37 million from 2010 primarily reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flows 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expenses were 288 billion for 2011 an increase of 17 billion or 63 from 2010 the increases were primarily due to a 18 billion or 113 yearoveryear increase in retail segment benefit expenses in 2011 primarily driven by an increase in the average number of medicare members partially offset by a decline in employer group segment benefit expenses 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2011 was 821 declining 80 basis points from the 2010 benefit ratio of 829 primarily driven by a decline in the retail segment benefit ratio and a net charge for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care policies in our other businesses in 2010 that did not recur in 2011 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased 10 billion or 232 during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due an increase in operating costs in our health and wellbeing segment as a result of the acquisition of concentra on december 21 2010 as well as an increase in operating costs in our retail segment as a result of increased expenses associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership operating costs for 2010 include 147 million for the writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical policies in our retail segment 

  

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2011 was 148 increasing 160 basis points from the 2010 operating cost ratio of 132 the 147 million writedown of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 increased the operating cost ratio 50 basis points for 2010 excluding the impact of the writedown of deferred acquisition costs in 2010 the increase primarily reflects the greater percentage of our revenues derived from concentra acquired december 21 2010 in our health and wellbeing services segment which carries a higher operating cost ratio on external revenues than our other segments as well as an increase in the retail and employer group segment operating cost ratios 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2011 totaled 270 million an increase of 25 million or 102 from 2010 primarily reflecting depreciation and amortization expense associated with our concentra operations acquired on december 21 2010 

interest expense 

interest expense was 109 million for 2011 compared to 105 million for 2010 an increase of 4 million or 38 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2011 was 365 compared to the effective tax rate of 372 in 2010 the higher tax rate for 2010 primarily was due to the cumulative adjustment associated with estimating the retrospective aspect of new limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of 500000 per employee as mandated by the health insurance reform legislation see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

certain financial data on a consolidated basis and for our segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

consolidated 

 

  

    

summary 

net income was 11 billion or 647 per diluted common share in 2010 compared to 10 billion or 615 per diluted common share in 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in average medicare advantage membership and favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development in 2010 in both our retail and employer group segments our diluted earnings per common share for 2010 include the beneficial impact of favorable priorperiod medical claims reserve development of approximately 086 per diluted common share these increases were partially offset by a 147 million 055 per diluted common share writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical policies in our retail segment and a net charge of 139 million 052 per diluted common share for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care policies in our other businesses in 2010 as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data net income for 2009 also included the favorable impact of the reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 010 per diluted common share as a result of internal revenue service audit settlements 

premiums revenue 

consolidated premiums increased 28 billion or 93 from 2009 to 327 billion for 2010 the increase primarily was due to higher premiums revenue in the employer group and retail segments primarily as a result of higher average medicare advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums as well as increased premiums for other businesses as a result of our new contract with cms to administer the linet program in 2010 

services revenue 

consolidated services revenue increased 35 million or 67 from 2009 to 555 million for 2010 primarily due to an increase in services revenue in our employer group segment primarily as a result of a new group medicare aso account in 2010 partially offset by a decline in commercial aso membership as well as an increase in primary care services revenue in our health and wellbeing services segment primarily as a result of the acquisition of concentra on december 21 2010 

investment income 

investment income totaled 329 million for 2010 an increase of 33 million from 296 million for 2009 primarily reflecting higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flows partially offset by lower interest rates 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expenses were 271 billion for 2010 an increase of 23 billion or 94 from 248 billion for 2009 the increase primarily was driven by an increase in the average number of medicare advantage members 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2010 was 829 essentially unchanged increasing only 10 basis points from the 2009 benefit ratio of 828 

operating costs 

our segments incur both direct and shared indirect operating costs we allocate the indirect costs shared by the segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

consolidated operating costs increased 366 million or 91 during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the 147 million writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual commercial medical 

  

policies in 2010 increased medicare investment spending for our 2011 offerings and operating costs associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership partially offset by a decrease in the number of our employees as a result of our administrative cost reduction strategies including planned workforce reductions in 2010 excluding employees added with the acquisition of concentra on december 21 2010 the number of employees decreased by 800 to 27300 at december 31 2010 from 28100 at december 31 2009 or 28 as we aligned the size of our workforce with our membership 

the consolidated operating cost ratio for 2010 of 132 remained unchanged from the 2009 ratio as an increase in the retail segment operating cost ratio was offset by declines in the employer group and health and wellbeing services segment operating cost ratios

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2010 was 372 compared to the effective tax rate of 351 in 2009 the increase from 2009 to 2010 primarily was due to the reduction of the 17 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements which reduced the effective income tax rate by 10 during 2009 in addition the tax rate for 2010 reflects the estimated impact of new limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of 500000 per employee as mandated by recent health insurance reforms see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate

pretax losses for our other businesses of 2 million for 2010 compared to pretax income of 97 million for 2009 the decline in operating performance from 2009 to 2010 primarily resulted from a net charge of 139 million 

  

associated with reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care policies in 2010 partially offset by pretax income in 2010 associated with our new contract with cms to administer the linet program under which we began providing services in the first quarter of 2010 

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums services revenues and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments operating costs interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings dividends and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment from period to period our cash flows may also be affected by the timing of working capital items the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital and seek approval before paying dividends from the subsidiaries to the parent 

cash and cash equivalents decreased to 14 billion at december 31 2011 from 17 billion at december 31 2010 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings enrollment activity and changes in working capital items as discussed below cash flows were positively impacted by medicare enrollment gains in 2011 and 2010 because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months conversely during 2009 cash flows were negatively impacted by the payment of runoff claims associated with enrollment losses in our standalone pdp business 

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefit expenses and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

   

 

 

    the increase in benefits payable in 2011 primarily was due to an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including amounts due to our pharmacy benefit administrator which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff and an increase in military services benefits payable the increase in benefits payable in 2010 and 2009 primarily was due to an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements as well as an increase in ibnr both primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth partially offset by a decrease in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to the monthend cutoff 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees the claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the 42 million increase in base receivables for 2011 as compared to 2010 the 26 million decrease in base receivables for 2010 as compared to 2009 and the 15 million increase in base receivables for 2009 as compared to 2008 

medicare receivables are impacted by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

  

commercial and other receivables for 2011 and 2010 include 144 million and 109 million respectively of patient services receivables acquired with the acquisition of concentra in december 2010 in addition the allowance for doubtful accounts increased 33 million from 2010 to 2011 primarily due to the concentra acquisition the increase in concentra receivables and the related allowance in 2011 result from the requirement to record acquired balances at fair value at the acquisition date excluding the receivables acquired with concentra the timing of reimbursements from the puerto rico health insurance administration for our medicaid business primarily resulted in the increase in commercial and other receivables for 2010 as compared to 2009 followed by a decrease from 2010 to 2011 

in addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and services fees and payments of benefit expenses other working capital items impacting operating cash flows over the past three years primarily resulted from the timing of payments for the medicare part d risk corridor provisions of our contracts with cms as well as changes in the timing of collections of pharmacy rebates 

cash flow from investing activities 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily investmentgrade fixed income securities totaling 850 million in 2011 827 million in 2010 and 20 billion in 2009 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives support of services in our concentra and other medical facilities and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 346 million in 2011 222 million in 2010 and 185 million in 2009 with 2011 reflecting increased spending associated with growth in our primary care services and pharmacy businesses in our health and wellbeing services segment excluding acquisitions we expect total capital expenditures in 2012 of approximately 350 million cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 226 million in 2011 833 million in 2010 and 12 million in 2009 primarily related to the anvita and md care acquisitions in 2011 and the concentra acquisition in 2010 

cash flow from financing activities 

receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were 378 million less than claims payments during 2011 237 million less than claim payments during 2010 and 493 million higher than claims payments during 2009 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

during 2011 we repurchased 67 million shares for 492 million under the stock repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors in december 2009 and april 2011 during 2010 we repurchased 199 million shares for 100 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors in december 2009 we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 49 million in 2011 8 million in 2010 and 23 million in 2009 

during 2011 we paid dividends to stockholders of 82 million as discussed further below no dividends were paid during 2010 or 2009 

in 2009 net borrowings under our then existing credit agreement decreased 250 million primarily from the repayment of amounts borrowed to fund a 2008 acquisition 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2011 2010 and 2009 primarily resulted from proceeds from stock option exercises the change in the book overdraft and the change in the securities lending payable the decrease in securities lending since 2009 resulted from lower margins earned under the program which terminated in the fourth quarter of 2011 

  

future sources and uses of liquidity 

dividends 

in april 2011 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends is at the discretion of the board and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change 

the following table provides details of dividends declared in 2011 

 

 stock repurchase authorization 

in april 2011 the board of directors replaced its previously approved share repurchase authorization of up to 250 million with a new authorization for repurchases of up to 1 billion of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans the new authorization will expire june 30 2013 under the new share repurchase authorization shares could be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases or in privatelynegotiated transactions subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume pricing and timing as of february 6 2012 the remaining authorized amount under the new authorization totaled 561 million 

senior notes 

we previously issued 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 300 million of 630 senior notes due august 1 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 the 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances all four series of our senior notes which are unsecured may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified makewhole amount our senior notes are more fully discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

in november 2011 we amended and restated our 3year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which was set to expire in december 2013 and replaced it with a 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving agreement expiring november 2016 under the new credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread the libor spread currently 120 basis points varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 875 to 1475 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 175 basis points may fluctuate between 125 and 275 basis points depending upon our credit ratings the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option 

the terms of the new credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds in addition the new credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary 

  

events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of 60 billion at december 31 2011 and a maximum leverage ratio of 301 we are in compliance with the financial covenants with actual net worth of 81 billion and actual leverage ratio of 061 as measured in accordance with the new credit agreement as of december 31 2011 in addition the new credit agreement includes an uncommitted 250 million incremental loan facility 

at december 31 2011 we had no borrowings outstanding under the new credit agreement we have outstanding letters of credit of 14 million secured under the new credit agreement no amounts have been drawn on these letters of credit accordingly as of december 31 2011 we had 986 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the new credit agreement none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement 

other longterm borrowings 

other longterm borrowings of 36 million at december 31 2011 represent junior subordinated debt the junior subordinated debt which is due in 2037 may be called by us without penalty in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 802 payable quarterly until 2012 and then payable at a floating rate based on libor plus 310 basis points 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2011 was bbb according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 2 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 8 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry the parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company were 494 million at december 31 2011 and 553 million at december 31 2010 during 2011 our subsidiaries paid dividends of 11 billion to the parent compared to 747 million in 2010 and 774 million in 2009 refer to our parent company financial statements and accompanying notes in schedule i – parent company financial information as described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “health insurance reform” in december 2011 the naic issued proposed guidance indicating the insurance industry premiumbased assessment may require accrual and associated subsidiary funding consideration in 2013 instead of 2014 this proposed naic guidance is contradictory to final gaap guidance issued by the fasb in july 2011 which indicates the insurance industry premiumbased assessment should be accrued beginning in 2014 the year in which it is payable 

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments 

  

to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately 47 billion and 43 billion as of december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements the amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2012 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately 970 million in the aggregate this compares to dividends that were able to be paid in 2011 without prior regulatory approval of approximately 740 million 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2011 as follows 

 

  

       

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2011 we were not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

government contracts 

our medicare products which accounted for approximately 65 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily consisted of products covered under the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan contracts with the federal government these contracts are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare products have been renewed for 2012 and all of our product offerings filed with cms for 2012 have been approved 

cms uses a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under this model rates paid to medicare advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process that bases our prospective payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s original medicare program under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans we generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims 

cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected medicare advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data these audits are referred to herein as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to medicare advantage plans 

  

on december 21 2010 cms posted a description of the agency’s proposed radv sampling and payment adjustment calculation methodology to its website and invited public comment noting that cms may revise its sampling and payment error calculation methodology based upon the comments received we believe the audit and payment adjustment methodology proposed by cms is fundamentally flawed and actuarially unsound in essence in making the comparison referred to above cms relies on two interdependent sets of data to set payment rates for medicare advantage ma plans 1 fee for service ffs data from the government’s original medicare program and 2 ma data the proposed methodology would review medical records for only one set of data ma data while not performing the same exercise on the other set ffs data however because these two sets of data are inextricably linked we believe cms must audit and validate both of them before determining the financial implications of any potential radv audit results in order to ensure that any resulting payment adjustment is accurate we believe that the social security act under which the payment model was established requires the consistent use of these data sets in determining riskadjusted payments to ma plans furthermore our payment received from cms as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members is based on bids that did not by cms design include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments we believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after cms acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums 

cms has received public comments including our comments and comments from other industry participants and the american academy of actuaries which expressed concerns about the failure to appropriately compare the two sets of data on february 3 2011 cms issued a statement that it was closely evaluating the comments it has received on this matter and anticipates making changes to the proposed methodology based on input it has received although we are unable to predict the extent of changes that they may make 

to date six humana contracts have been selected by cms for radv audits for the 2007 contract year consisting of one “pilot” audit and five “targeted” audits for humana plans we believe that the proposed methodology for these audits is actuarially unsound and in violation of the social security act we intend to defend that position vigorously however if cms moves forward with implementation of the proposed methodology without changes to adequately address the data inconsistency issues described above it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from the medicare advantage program and therefore our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

at december 31 2011 our military services business which accounted for approximately 10 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily consisted of the tricare south region contract the original 5year south region contract expired on march 31 2009 and was extended through march 31 2012 on february 25 2011 the department of defense tricare management activity or tma awarded the new tricare south region contract to us which we expect to take effect on april 1 2012 the new 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2017 is subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year during its term at the government’s option 

under the current tricare south region contract any variance from the negotiated target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 3 of our total premiums and services revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico effective october 1 2010 as amended in may 2011 the puerto rico health insurance administration or prhia awarded us three contracts for the east southeast and southwest regions for a three year term through june 30 2013 

  

the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefit expense recognition 

benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 

 

 military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data this amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government as more fullydescribed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “cash flow from operating activities” 

estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results of operations and overall financial position accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” as such we expect that substantially all of the december 31 2011 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2012 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an 

  

assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing changes in medical management processes product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including recoveries of overpayments receipt cycle times claim inventory levels outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors claim payments to providers for services rendered are often net of overpayment recoveries for claims paid previously as contractually allowed claim overpayment recoveries can result from many different factors including retroactive enrollment activity audits of provider billings andor payment errors changes in patterns of claim overpayment recoveries can be unpredictable and result in completion factor volatility as they often impact older dates of service the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last several years if claims are submitted or processed on a faster slower pace than prior periods the actual claim may be more less complete than originally estimated using our completion factors which may result in reserves that are higher lower than required 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services new higher priced technologies and medical procedures and new prescription drugs and therapies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes the tort liability system increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population lifestyle changes including diet and smoking catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most 

  

recent three months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2011 data 

 

  

   the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 

 

 the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefit expenses ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 

  

 

  

 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant the amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has been impacted by the growth in our medicare products coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices when we recognize a release of the redundancy we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business if material 

during 2011 and 2010 we experienced prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of approximately 205 million and 231 million respectively this favorable reserve development primarily resulted from improvements in the claims processing environment and to a lesser extent better than originally estimated utilization in addition in 2010 a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions was a contributing factor the improvements in the claims processing environment benefited all lines of business during 2011 but were most prominent in our medicare pffs line of business in 2010 as a result of these improvements we experienced a significant increase in claim overpayment recoveries during 2011 for claims with 2010 and 2009 dates of service and during 2010 for claims with 2009 and 2008 dates of service primarily as a result of increased audits of provider billings as well as system enhancements that improved the claim recovery functionality this increase resulted in our historical completion factors being understated for those periods since they had been developed using our previous historical experience the remaining reserve redundancy primarily resulted from our consistent application of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as described above we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2011 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 our current tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk of financing health benefits the federal government both reimburses us for our cost of providing health benefits and bears responsibility for 80 of any variance from the annual targeted health care cost and actual health care cost as more fully described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of 

  

financial condition and results of operations under the section titled “military services” therefore the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for tricare benefits payable is reduced substantially by corresponding adjustments to revenues the net change in income from operations as determined retrospectively after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period was a decrease of approximately 14 million for 2010 and an increase of approximately 9 million for 2009 the impact from changes in estimates for 2011 is not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2012 will change as our december 31 2011 benefits payable estimate develops throughout 2012 

future policy benefits payable of 17 billion and 15 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care life insurance annuities and certain health and other supplemental policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits 

future policy benefits payable include 938 million at december 31 2011 and 825 million at december 31 2010 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold to the extent premium rate increases andor loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required during the fourth quarter of 2010 certain states approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our longterm care block that were significantly below our acquisition date assumptions based on these actions by the states combined with lower interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition date assumptions we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our longterm care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded 139 million of additional benefit expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 170 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 31 million included in other longterm assets in addition future policy benefits payable include amounts of 224 million at december 31 2011 and 229 million at december 31 2010 which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

  

premiums revenue and administrative services only or aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay and beginning january 1 2011 for estimated rebates to policyholders under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health insurance reform legislation enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends estimated rebates as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium remittances from employer groups and members in our medicare and other individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from cms for our medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable based on the submission of diagnosis data to cms and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare part d provisions 

we cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d under multiple contracts with cms the payments we receive monthly from cms and members which are determined from our annual bid represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage we recognize premiums revenue for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract our cms payment is subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions in addition receipts for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as receipts for certain discounts on brand name prescription drugs in the coverage gap represent payments for prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk 

the risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premiums revenue related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period accordingly this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience we record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or longterm in the consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of expected settlement 

the estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain at period end including member eligibility and risk adjustment score differences with cms as well as pharmacy rebates from manufacturers these factors have an offsetting effect on changes in the risk corridor estimate in 2011 we paid 380 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2010 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 388 million at december 31 2010 in 2010 we paid 180 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2009 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 145 million at december 31 2009 the net liability associated with the 2011 risk corridor estimate which will be settled in 2012 was 329 million at december 31 2011 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent funding from cms for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and related settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year beginning in 2011 the health reform legislation mandates 

  

consumer discounts of 50 on brand name prescription drugs for part d plan participants in the coverage gap these discounts are funded by cms and pharmaceutical manufacturers while we administer the application of these funds we account for these subsidies and discounts as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize premiums revenue or benefit expenses for these subsidies or discounts receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period gross financing receipts were 25 billion and gross financing withdrawals were 29 billion during 2011 cms subsidy and brand name prescription drug discount activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2011 was 363 million to other current assets and 139 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 

in order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage cms provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage or coverage beyond cms’s defined standard benefits the demonstration payment option available to plans through 2010 was an arrangement in which cms agreed to pay a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government’s portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage the capitation amount represented a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer we chose the demonstration payment option for some of our plans that offered enhanced coverage for plan years through 2010 this capitation amount derived from our annual bid submissions was recorded as premiums revenue the variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer was subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the brand name prescription drug discounts and risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year we continue to revise our estimates with respect to the risk corridor provisions based on subsequent period pharmacy claims data 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the riskadjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans rates paid to medicare advantage plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process that bases our payments on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s original medicare program we generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims we estimate riskadjustment revenues based on the submission of diagnosis data to cms the riskadjustment model is more fully described in item 1 – business under the section titled “individual medicare” 

military services 

in 2011 revenues derived from our military services business represented approximately 10 of consolidated premiums and services revenue military services premiums and services revenue primarily is derived from our tricare south region contract with the department of defense the current tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities we allocate the consideration to the various components of the contract based on the relative fair value of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn 

  

reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative services fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

the current tricare south region contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target health care cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance of actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses we continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

the military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

patient services 

patient services revenue associated with the december 21 2010 acquisition of concentra includes 1 workers’ compensation injury care and related services and 2 other healthcare services related to employer needs or statutory requirements patient services revenues are recognized in the period services are provided to the customer when the sales price is fixed or determinable and are net of contractual allowances 

the provider reimbursement methods for workers’ compensation injury care and related services vary on a statebystate basis most states have fee schedules pursuant to which all healthcare providers are uniformly reimbursed the fee schedules are determined by each state and generally prescribe the maximum amounts that may be reimbursed for a designated procedure in the states without fee schedules healthcare providers are reimbursed based on usual customary and reasonable fees charged in the particular state in which the services are provided we include billings for services in revenue net of allowance for estimated differences between list prices and allowable fee schedule rates or amounts allowed as usual customary and reasonable as applicable 

revenue for other healthcare services is recognized on a feeforservice basis at estimated collectible amounts at the time services are rendered our fees are determined in advance for each type of service performed 

  

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 95 billion or 53 of total assets at december 31 2011 and 84 billion or 52 of total assets at december 31 2010 debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2011 and at december 31 2010 the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

 approximately 95 of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with a weighted average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2011 most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 332 million at december 31 2011 and 344 million at december 31 2010 these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations at the time the fund is established taxexempt municipal securities that were not prerefunded were diversified among general obligation bonds of us states and local municipalities and special revenue bonds general obligation bonds which are backed by the taxing power and full faith of the issuer accounted for 11 billion of these municipals in the portfolio special revenue bonds issued by a municipality to finance a specific public works project such as utilities water and sewer transportation and education and supported by the revenues of that project accounted for 14 billion of these municipals our general obligation bonds are diversified across the us with no individual state exceeding 11 in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our taxexempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 634 million and 597 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively of taxexempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent weighted average sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa 

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was 3 million at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio 

the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 193 at december 31 2011 and 294 at december 31 2010 

  

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2011 

 

 under the otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

the recoverability of our residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities is supported by factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements our residential and commercial 

  

mortgagebacked securities at december 31 2011 primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit support with 99 of the collateral consisting of prime loans the weighted average credit rating of all commercial mortgagebacked securities was aa at december 31 2011 

several european countries including spain italy ireland portugal and greece have been subject to credit deterioration due to weakness in their economic and fiscal situations we have no direct exposure to sovereign issuances of these five countries 

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2011 remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased at december 31 2011 we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2011 

there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2011 2010 or 2009 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2011 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 23 of total assets and 51 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 23 and 55 respectively at december 31 2010 

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition the realignment of our business segments and corresponding change in our reportable segments more fully described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8financial statements and supplementary data resulted in a change in the composition of our reporting units accordingly we reassigned goodwill to our reporting units as of january 1 2011 using the relative fair value approach based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8financial statements and supplementary data a significant portion of our historical goodwill was supported by future cash flows associated with our mailorder pharmacy and behavioral health businesses now grouped with our health  wellbeing services businesses this in addition with the concentra acquisition on december 21 2010 resulted in the allocation of a substantial portion of our goodwill to the health  wellbeing services segment we completed an interim impairment test as of january 1 2011 based on the new reporting units which did not result in an impairment loss 

we use a twostep process to review goodwill for impairment the first step is a screen for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment if any our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and operating cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and 

  

annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the ultimate outcome of the health insurance reform legislation the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a substantial margin a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on the amount of margin for any of our reporting units with significant goodwill 

beginning in 2012 we are allowed to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8financial statements and supplementary data 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense prior to 2009 under interest rate swap agreements we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements in 2008 fixing the average interest rate under our senior notes at 608 we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor plus a spread or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2011 or december 31 2010 

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with a weighted average sp credit rating of aa at december 31 2011 our net unrealized position improved 328 million from a net unrealized gain position of 197 million at december 31 2010 to a net unrealized gain position of 525 million at december 31 2011 at december 31 2011 we had gross unrealized losses of 17 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased and as such there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2011 while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of 

  

our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 39 years as of december 31 2011 and 40 years as of december 31 2010 based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 420 million 

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2011 and 2010 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may affect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points four times and have changed by less than 100 basis points five times

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a—risk factors for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business 

health insurance reform 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in 

  

the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

certain significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation include among others mandated coverage requirements rebates to policyholders based on minimum benefit ratios adjustments to medicare advantage premiums the establishment of statebased exchanges and an annual insurance industry premiumbased assessment implementation dates of the health insurance reform legislation vary from as early as six months from the date of enactment or september 30 2010 to as late as 2018 the health insurance reform legislation is discussed more fully beginning on page 40 

business segments 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals when identifying our segments we aggregated products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

  

our products 

as more fully described in the products discussion that follows we provide health insurance benefits under health maintenance organization or hmo private feeforservice or pffs and preferred provider organization or ppo plans on january 1 2011 most of our members enrolled in pffs plans transitioned to networkedbased ppo type plans in addition we provide other benefits with our specialty products including dental vision and other supplementary benefits the following table presents our segment membership at december 31 2010 and premiums and administrative services only or aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2010 

 

 our government segment products 

medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 20 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states the resulting growing membership base provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care including cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes that result in living healthier 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits cms an agency of the united states department of 

  

health and human services administers the medicare program hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under original medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance throughout this document this program is referred to as original medicare as an alternative to original medicare in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the medicare advantage program medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a medicare advantage organization under medicare part c pursuant to medicare part c medicare advantage organizations contract with cms to offer medicare advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under original medicare our medicare advantage plans are discussed more fully below prescription drug benefits are provided under part d 

medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month medicare advantage products may be sold to individuals or on a group basis with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original medicare typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions disease management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between november 15 and december 31 for coverage that begins january 1 beginning in 2011 individuals may enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on january 1 2012 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in most cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

our medicare pffs plans generally have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to original medicare payment rates on january 1 2011 most of our members enrolled in pffs plans transitioned to networkedbased ppo type products due to a requirement that medicare advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms transitioned to this riskbased payment model while the old payment model based on 

  

demographic data including gender age and disability status was phased out the phasein of risk adjusted payment was completed in 2007 under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

at december 31 2010 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 1762000 medicare advantage members for which we received premium and aso fees revenues of approximately 193 billion or 581 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 under our medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 378700 members these contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately 55 billion which represented approximately 285 of our medicare advantage premium revenues or 165 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage business have been renewed for 2011 

medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between november 15 and december 31 for coverage that begins january 1 beginning in 2011 individuals may enroll in one of our plan choices between october 15 and december 7 for coverage that begins on january 1 2012 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance in october 2010 we announced the lowest premium national standalone medicare part d prescription drug plan cobranded with walmart stores inc the humana walmartpreferred rx plan to be offered for the 2011 plan year our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described beginning on page 68 our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp business have been renewed for 2011 

medicare standalone pdp premium revenues were approximately 23 billion or 70 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 

medicaid product 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a statespecific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

  

our medicaid business which accounted for premium revenues of approximately 7236 million or 22 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico 

military services 

under our tricare south region contract with the united states department of defense or dod we provide health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in a hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers similar to a ppo 

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 30 million eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2010 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense of these eligible beneficiaries 13 million were tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries and seniors over the age of 65 for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract the original 5year south region contract expired on march 31 2009 and was extended through march 31 2011 on october 5 2010 we were notified that the department of defense tricare management activity or tma intended to negotiate with us for an extension of our administration of the tricare south region contract and on january 6 2011 an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract in the form of an undefinitized contract action became effective the amendment adds one additional oneyear option period option period ix which runs from april 1 2011 through march 31 2012 the amendment does not include the costs of the underwritten target health care cost and underwritten health care target fee which will be negotiated separately on january 21 2011 the tma notified us of their intent to exercise option period ix 

as required under the current contract the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for option period ix will be negotiated separately any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments 

in july 2009 we were notified by the department of defense that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the government accountability office or gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest on october 22 2010 tma issued its latest amendment to the request for proposal requesting from offerors final proposal revisions to address among other things health care cost savings resulting from provider network discounts in the south region we submitted our final proposal revisions on november 9 2010 at this time we are not able to determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

  

for the year ended december 31 2010 military services premium revenues were approximately 35 billion or 104 of our total premiums and aso fees and military services aso fees totaled 991 million or 03 of our total premiums and aso fees the tricare south region contract represents approximately 96 of total military services premiums and aso fees 

our commercial segment products

ppo 

our commercial ppo products which are marketed primarily to employer groups and individuals include some types of wellness and utilization management programs however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

capitation 

for approximately 10 of our medical membership at december 31 2010 we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefit ratio the benefit ratio measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

for approximately 89 of our medical membership at december 31 2010 we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for services rendered we share hospital and other benefit expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 capitation expense as a percentage of total benefit expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

   

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

physicians participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans andor departments from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and the utilization review accreditation commission or urac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa performs reviews of our compliance with standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in all of our commercial medicare and medicaid hmopos markets with enough history and membership except puerto rico and for many of our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our medicare medicaid and commercial products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 1800 sales representatives as well as approximately 800 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with state farm ® and united services automobile association or usaa finally we sell group medicare advantage products through large employers including via an alliance with cigna corporation under the terms of the alliance we and cigna coordinate services and share financial results commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure approved by cms 

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and 

  

expectations of their employees or members we also offer commercial health insurance and specialty products directly to individuals 

at december 31 2010 we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 1100 licensed employees to sell our commercial insurance products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics including certain other incentives for our commercial brokers these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

underwriting 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of all of the material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

other 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and 

  

general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 35200 employees including approximately 1900 medical professionals working at the concentra medical centers and 34 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages

 item 1a risk factors tableend if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns these estimates however involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in payment patterns and medical cost trends 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including life insurance annuities health and longterm care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables as modified based upon actual experience 

  

the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 8246 million at december 31 2010 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg america corporation acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions additional future adjustments to reserves could be required during the fourth quarter of 2010 certain states approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our longterm care block that were significantly below our acquisition date assumptions based on these actions by the states combined with lower interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition date assumptions we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our longterm care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded 1389 million of additional benefit expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 1703 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 314 million included in other longterm assets 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract including the possible termination of our tricare south region contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

  

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in the medicare business 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position us for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs including our hmo and ppo products as well as our standalone pdp products we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia 

the growth of our medicare business is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the medicare business there is significant concentration of our revenues in the medicare business with approximately 65 of our total premiums and aso fees in 2010 generated from our medicare business these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business with emphasis on our aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs expansion of our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products the adoption of new technologies development of adjacent businesses and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts including the 2010 acquisition of concentra inc 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives including outsourcing certain business functions that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

  

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents providers and other stakeholders through webenabled technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business may be materially adversely impacted by cms’s adoption of the new coding set for diagnoses 

cms has adopted a new coding set for diagnoses commonly known as icd10 which significantly expands the number of codes utilized the new coding set is currently required to be implemented by october 1 2013 we may be required to incur significant expenses in implementing the new coding set if we do not adequately implement the new coding set our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are or may become a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see “legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters” in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to risks that may materially adversely affect our business or our willingness or ability to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs our government segment accounted for approximately 78 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

 

   

  

 as required under the current contract the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for option period ix will be negotiated separately any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in july 2009 we were notified by the dod that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest on october 22 2010 tma issued its latest amendment to the request for proposal requesting from offerors final proposal revisions to address among other things health care cost savings resulting from provider network discounts in the south region we submitted our final proposal revisions on november 9 2010 at this time we are not able to determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

for the year ended december 31 2010 premiums and aso fees associated with the tricare south region contract were 34 billion or 103 of our total premiums and aso fees we are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill which had a carrying value of 498 million at december 31 2010 potential exit costs possible asset sales and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2010 if our current contract is extended through march 31 2012 and we are not ultimately awarded the new third generation tricare program contract for the south region we expect that as the march 31 2012 contract end date nears future cash flows will not be sufficient to warrant recoverability of all or a portion of the military services goodwill in this event we expect a goodwill impairment would occur during the second half of 2011 

 

   

 effective october 1 2010 the prhia awarded us three contracts for the east southeast and southwest regions for a one year term with two options to extend the contracts for an additional term of up to one year exercisable at the sole discretion of the prhia the loss of these contracts or significant changes in the puerto rico medicaid program as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

  

 cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected medicare advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data these audits are referred to herein as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to medicare advantage plans to date six humana contracts have been selected by cms for radv audits for the 2007 contract year consisting of one “pilot” audit and five “targeted” audits for humana plans 

on december 21 2010 cms posted a description of the agency’s proposed radv sampling and payment adjustment calculation methodology to its website and invited public comment noting that cms may revise its sampling and payment error calculation methodology based upon the comments received we believe the audit and payment adjustment methodology proposed by cms is fundamentally flawed and actuarially unsound in essence in making the comparison referred to above cms relies on two interdependent sets of data to set payment rates for medicare advantage ma plans 1 fee for service ffs data from the government’s original medicare program and 2 ma data the proposed methodology would review medical records for only one set of data ma data while not performing the same exercise on the other set ffs data however because these two sets of data are inextricably linked we believe cms must audit and validate both of them before extrapolating any potential radv audit results in order to ensure that any resulting payment adjustment is accurate we believe that the social security act under which the payment model was established requires the consistent use of these data sets in determining riskadjusted payments to ma plans furthermore our payment received from cms as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members is based on bids that did not by cms design include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments we believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after cms acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums 

  

cms has received public comments including our comments and comments from other industry participants and the american academy of actuaries which expressed concerns about the failure to appropriately compare the two sets of data on february 3 2011 cms issued a statement that it was closely evaluating the comments it has received on this matter and anticipates making changes to the proposed methodology based on input it has received although we are unable to predict the extent of changes that they may make 

we believe that the proposed methodology is actuarially unsound and in violation of the social security act we intend to defend that position vigorously however if cms moves forward with implementation of the proposed methodology without changes to adequately address the data inconsistency issues described above it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from the medicare advantage program and therefore our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms beginning in 2008 the risk corridor thresholds increased which means we bear more risk our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 3876 million at december 31 2010 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment which we would have otherwise received as a lowincome or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 

   

  

 recently enacted health insurance reform including the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and administrative costs by among other things requiring a minimum benefit ratio lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with a nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows in addition if the new nondeductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the health insurance reform legislation have been issued to date by the department of health and human services hhs the department of labor the treasury department and the national association of insurance commissioners there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

the provisions of the health insurance reform legislation include among others imposing significant new nondeductible federal premium taxes and other assessments on health insurers limiting medicare advantage payment rates stipulating a prescribed minimum ratio for the amount of premium revenues to be expended on medical costs additional mandated benefits and guarantee issuance associated with commercial medical insurance requirements that limit the ability of health plans to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk and heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulators of our business practices including our medicare bid and pricing practices the health insurance reform legislation also specifies required benefit designs limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants and expands eligibility for medicaid programs in addition the law will significantly 

  

increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers health plans and individuals beginning in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare implementation dates of the provisions of the health insurance reform legislation generally vary from as early as six months from the date of enactment or september 23 2010 to as late as 2018 

implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation and it has been challenged in the judicial system given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation implementation and timing of these changes which we expect to occur over the next several years the health insurance reform legislation could change the way we do business potentially impacting our pricing benefit design product mix geographic mix and distribution channels the response of other companies to health insurance reform legislation and adjustments to their offerings if any could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care markets further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level it is reasonably possible that the health insurance reform legislation and related regulations as well as future legislative changes in the aggregate may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and administrative costs lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and cash flows if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the health insurance reform legislation our business may be materially adversely affected in addition if the new nondeductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability financial condition and cash flows

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans 

american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the 

  

consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to the us department of health and human services in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires the us department of health and human services to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements we will continue to assess the impact of these regulations on us as they are issued 

workers’ compensation laws and regulations 

in performing services for the workers’ compensation industry through our subsidiary concentra inc we must comply with applicable state workers’ compensation laws workers’ compensation laws generally require employers to assume financial responsibility for medical costs lost wages and related legal costs of workrelated illnesses and injuries these laws generally establish the rights of workers to receive benefits and to appeal benefit denials prohibit charging medical copayments or deductibles to employees may restrict employers’ rights to select healthcare providers or direct an injured employee to a specific provider to receive nonemergency workers’ compensation medical care and may include special requirements for physicians providing nonemergency care for workers’ compensation patients including requiring registration with the state agency governing workers’ compensation as well as special continuing education and training licensing and other regulatory requirements to the extent that we are governed by these regulations we may be subject to additional licensing requirements financial oversight and procedural standards for beneficiaries and providers 

corporate practice of medicine and other laws 

we are not licensed to practice medicine many states in which we operate through our subsidiary concentra inc limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals and business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians statutes and regulations relating to the practice of medicine feesplitting between physicians and referral sources and similar issues vary widely from state to state under the management agreements with concentra’s professional groups these groups retain sole responsibility for all medical decisions as well as for hiring and managing physicians and other licensed healthcare providers developing operating policies and procedures implementing professional standards and controls and maintaining malpractice insurance we believe that our health services operations including arrangements with concentra’s affiliated professional groups comply with applicable state statutes regarding corporate practice of medicine feesplitting and similar issues however any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging noncompliance with these statutes which could subject us to penalties or restructuring or reorganization of our business may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

antikickback physician selfreferral and other fraud and abuse laws 

a federal law commonly referred to as the “antikickback statute” prohibits the offer payment solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or in return for the referral of medicare or other governmental health program patients or patient care opportunities or in return for the purchase lease or order of items or services that are covered by medicare or other federal governmental health programs because the prohibitions contained in the antikickback statute apply to the furnishing of items or services for which payment is made in “whole or in part” the antikickback statute could be implicated if any portion of an item or service we provide is covered by any of the state or federal health benefit programs described above violation of these provisions constitutes a felony criminal offense and applicable sanctions could include exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

  

section 1877 of the social security act commonly known as the “stark law” prohibits physicians subject to certain exceptions described below from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services” in which the physician or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician or an immediate family member has entered into a compensation arrangement these prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 commonly known as “stark ii” amended prior federal physician selfreferral legislation known as “stark i” by expanding the list of designated health services to a total of 11 categories of health services the professional groups with which we are affiliated provide one or more of these designated health services persons or entities found to be in violation of the stark law are subject to denial of payment for services furnished pursuant to an improper referral civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 

many states also have enacted laws similar in scope and purpose to the antikickback statute and in more limited instances the stark law that are not limited to services for which medicare or medicaid payment is made in addition most states have statutes regulations or professional codes that restrict a physician from accepting various kinds of remuneration in exchange for making referrals these laws vary from state to state and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies in states that have enacted these statutes we believe that regulatory authorities and state courts interpreting these statutes may regard federal law under the antikickback statute and the stark law as persuasive 

we believe that our operations comply with the antikickback statute the stark law and similar federal or state laws addressing fraud and abuse these laws are subject to modification and changes in interpretation and are enforced by authorities vested with broad discretion we continually monitor developments in this area if these laws are interpreted in a manner contrary to our interpretation or are reinterpreted or amended or if new legislation is enacted with respect to healthcare fraud and abuse illegal remuneration or similar issues we may be required to restructure our affected operations to maintain compliance with applicable law there can be no assurances that any such restructuring will be possible or if possible would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

environmental 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment including those governing the management and disposal of infectious medical waste and other waste generated at our subsidiary concentra’s occupational healthcare centers and the cleanup of contamination if an environmental regulatory agency finds any of our facilities to be in violation of environmental laws penalties and fines may be imposed for each day of violation and the affected facility could be forced to cease operations we could also incur other significant costs such as cleanup costs or claims by third parties as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws although we believe that our environmental practices including waste handling and disposal practices are in material compliance with applicable laws future claims or violations or changes in environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

state regulation of insurancerelated products 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately 43 billion and 38 billion as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements the amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2011 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately 740 million in the aggregate this compares to dividends that were able to be paid in 2010 without prior regulatory approval of approximately 720 million 

any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability while we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses additional investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products expansion into new specialty markets acquisitions new taxes and assessments and implementation of regulatory requirements may occur from time to time 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously in 2010 we acquired concentra inc in 2008 we acquired unitedhealth group’s las vegas nevada individual securehorizons medicare advantage hmo business osf health plans inc metcare health plans inc and php companies inc dba cariten healthcare and in late 2007 we acquired kmg america corporation and compbenefits corporation the failure to successfully integrate these entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of the acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may also be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

  

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy business opened in 2006 competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs and internet companies as well as other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy in addition some states have proposed laws to regulate online pharmacies and we may be subject to this legislation if it is passed federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations pharmacies must register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailservices pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 

  

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost recent events have raised uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs the doj is currently conducting and the us house of representatives commerce committee has conducted an investigation into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances in addition our debt ratings impact both the 

  

cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under recent regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us economy continues to experience a period of slow economic growth and increased unemployment we have closely monitored the impact that this volatile economy is having on our commercial segment operations workforce reductions have caused corresponding membership losses in our fullyinsured group business continued weakness in the us economy and any resulting increases in unemployment may materially adversely affect our commercial medical membership results of operations financial position and cash flows 

additionally the continued weakness of the us economy has adversely affected the budget of individual states and of the federal government this could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military services and medicaid programs and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and other care increasing the costs of claims expenses submitted to us 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized 

  

loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthan temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and to refinance or repay debt however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

given the current economic climate our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility 

over the past three years the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility companyspecific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have contributed to this volatility our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could materially reduce our stock price in addition broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies based on our 2010 revenues of approximately 339 billion we provide fullservice benefits and wellness solutions offering a wide array of health pharmacy and supplemental benefit products for employer groups government benefit programs and individuals as well as primary and workplace care through our medical centers and worksite medical facilities as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 102 million members in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 71 million members in our specialty products 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals when identifying our segments we aggregated products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

our results are impacted by many factors but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium aso fee and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures new prescription drugs and therapies an aging population lifestyle challenges including diet and smoking the tort liability system and government regulation 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the selling general and administrative expense ratio or sga expense ratio which is computed by taking total selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues administrative services fees and other revenues represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

health insurance reform 

in march 2010 the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 which we collectively refer to as the health insurance reform legislation which enact significant reforms to various aspects of the us health insurance industry while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the health insurance reform legislation have been issued to date by the department of health and human services hhs the department of labor the treasury department and the national association of insurance commissioners there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impacts of the legislation on our overall business which we expect to occur over the next several years 

  

implementation dates of the health insurance reform legislation vary from as early as six months from the date of enactment or september 23 2010 to as late as 2018 the following outlines certain provisions of the health insurance reform legislation 

 

  

  

  

 the health insurance reform legislation also specifies required benefit designs limits rating and pricing practices encourages additional competition including potential incentives for new market entrants and expands eligibility for medicaid programs in addition the law will significantly increase federal oversight of health plan premium rates and could adversely affect our ability to appropriately adjust health plan premiums on a timely basis financing for these reforms will come in part from material additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers health plans and individuals beginning in 2014 as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare as described above 

our results of operations have been affected by the health insurance reform legislation during 2010 we recorded a charge of 1475 million to writedown deferred acquisition costs associated with our guaranteed renewable individual major medical policies since these costs will not be recoverable from our estimates of future cash flows based on an analysis that considered among others our current understanding of the pertinent provisions of the health insurance reform legislation including the 80 minimum benefit ratio requirement in addition our effective tax rate increased due to the limitation of deductible annual compensation over 500000 per employee 

as discussed above implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the health insurance reform legislation and it has been challenged in the judicial system given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation implementation and timing of these changes which we expect to occur over the next several years the health insurance reform legislation could change the way we do business potentially impacting our pricing benefit design product mix geographic mix and distribution channels the response of other companies to health insurance reform legislation and adjustments to their offerings if any could cause meaningful disruption in the local health care 

  

markets further various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level it is reasonably possible that the health insurance reform legislation and related regulations as well as future legislative changes in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including restricting revenue enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments restricting our ability to expand into new markets increasing our medical and administrative costs lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible federal premium tax and other assessments our financial position including our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and our cash flows if the new nondeductible federal premium tax is imposed as enacted and if we are unable to adjust our business model to address this new tax there can be no assurance that the nondeductible federal premium tax would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

government segment 

our strategy and commitment to the medicare programs have led to significant growth medicare advantage fullyinsured membership increased to 1733800 members at december 31 2010 up 225300 members or 149 from 1508500 members at december 31 2009 primarily due to sales of group medicare advantage products and preferred provider organization or ppo products average fullyinsured medicare advantage membership increased 157 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 likewise medicare advantage premium revenues have increased 175 to 193 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 from 164 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 we expect medicare advantage membership to increase by 90000 to 110000 members or approximately 5 to 6 in 2011 

beginning in 2011 sponsors of medicare advantage private feeforservice or pffs plans are required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans our development of networks in multiple areas of the country over the past few years made it possible for many of our pffs members to transition automatically to our networkbased products 

on april 5 2010 cms announced that medicare advantage payment rates would remain flat in 2011 based on the information available at the time we filed our 2011 bids in june 2010 we believe we effectively designed medicare advantage products that address the flat rates while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original medicare with a supplement policy as well as other medicare advantage competitors within our industry in addition we will continue to pursue our costreduction and outcomeenhancing strategies including care coordination and disease management which we believe will mitigate the adverse effects of the negative rate changes on our medicare advantage members nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the medicare advantage program failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we also offer medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program these plans provide varying degrees of coverage our medicare standalone pdp membership declined to 1758800 members at december 31 2010 down 169100 members or 88 from december 31 2009 resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience in october 2010 we announced the lowest premium national standalone medicare part d prescription drug plan cobranded with walmart stores inc the humana walmartpreferred rx plan to be offered for the 2011 plan year we expect medicare standalone pdp membership to increase between 525000 and 575000 members or approximately 30 to 33 in 2011 primarily due to increased sales particularly for the humana walmartpreferred rx plan 

our quarterly government segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in 

  

coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the government segment’s benefit ratio generally decreases as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

cms is conducting certain procedural riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits of us and various companies’ selected medicare advantage contracts to review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of rates paid to medicare advantage plans the radv audits are more fully described under “government contracts” beginning on page 61 

our military services business primarily consists of the tricare south region contract for the year ended december 31 2010 premiums and aso fees associated with the tricare south region contract were 34351 million or 103 of our total premiums and aso fees 

on march 3 2010 the tma exercised its options to extend the tricare south region contract for option period vii and option period viii the exercise of these option periods extends the tricare south region contract through march 31 2011 on october 5 2010 we were notified that the tma intended to negotiate with us for an extension of our administration of the tricare south region contract and on january 6 2011 an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract in the form of an undefinitized contract action became effective the amendment adds one additional oneyear option period option period ix which runs from april 1 2011 through march 31 2012 on january 21 2011 the tma notified us of their intent to exercise option period ix 

in july 2009 we were notified by the dod that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest on october 22 2010 tma issued its latest amendment to the request for proposal requesting from offerors final proposal revisions to address among other things health care cost savings resulting from provider network discounts in the south region we submitted our final proposal revisions on november 9 2010 at this time we are not able to determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

we are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill which had a carrying value of 498 million at december 31 2010 potential exit costs possible asset sales and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses military services goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2010 if our current contract is extended through march 31 2012 and we are not ultimately awarded the new third generation tricare program contract for the south region we expect that as the march 31 2012 contract end date nears future cash flows will not be sufficient to warrant recoverability of all or a portion of the military services goodwill in this event we expect a goodwill impairment would occur during the second half of 2011 

  

commercial segment 

commercial segment pretax earnings decreased 26 million or 25 for 2010 compared to 2009 commercial segment pretax earnings for 2010 were negatively impacted by a 1475 million writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies and a net charge of 1389 million due to reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care policies excluding these items commercial segment pretax earnings improved year over year due to medical trend that was lower than trend assumed in pricing continued pricing discipline administrative cost reductions and prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business as a result of significant reforms to the us health insurance industry discussed previously a substantial portion of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical block of business were not recoverable from future income and we recorded a charge to selling general and administrative expense of 1475 million during 2010 as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data during 2010 certain states approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our longterm care block that were significantly below our acquisition date assumptions based on these actions by the states combined with the depressed interest rate environment and increased expenses we recorded 1389 million of additional benefit expense in the fourth quarter of 2010 as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data commercial segment fullyinsured medical membership at december 31 2010 of 1633400 decreased 176100 members or 96 from december 31 2009 primarily as a result of continued pricing discipline the decreased utilization yearoveryear coupled with the favorable reserve releases led to a lower commercial segment benefit ratio for 2010 the writedown of deferred acquisition costs together with administrative costs associated with increased specialty and mailorder pharmacy business led to a higher commercial segment sga expense ratio for 2010

summary 

net income was 10994 million or 647 per diluted common share in 2010 compared to 10397 million or 615 per diluted common share in 2009 the increase primarily was due to improved operating performance in the government segment as a result of an increase in average medicare advantage membership and prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in 2010 in both our government and commercial segments these increases were partially offset by a 1475 million 055 per diluted common share writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies and a net charge of 1389 million 052 per diluted common share for reserve strengthening associated with our closed block of longterm care policies in our commercial segment in 2010 as discussed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data excluding these items commercial segment pretax earnings improved year over year due to decreased utilization our continued focus on pricing discipline and administrative cost reductions as well as the previously mentioned prior year favorable reserve releases the prior year favorable reserve development in both our government and commercial segments approximately 086 per diluted common share in 2010 primarily resulted from improvements in the claims processing environment and to a lesser extent better than originally estimated utilization as well as a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions net income for 2009 also included the favorable impact of the reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 010 per diluted common share as a result of internal revenue service audit settlements 

  

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 28 billion or 93 to 327 billion for 2010 compared to 299 billion for 2009 the increase primarily was due to higher premium revenues in the government segment premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 30 billion or 131 to 258 billion for 2010 compared to 228 billion for 2009 the increase primarily was attributable to higher average medicare advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period average fullyinsured medicare advantage membership increased 157 in 2010 compared to 2009 of the 225300 increase in fullyinsured medicare advantage members since december 31 2009 approximately 109600 members were associated with a new group medicare advantage contract added during the first quarter of 2010 with sales of our ppo products driving the majority of the increase in individual medicare advantage membership total fullyinsured group medicare advantage membership was 273100 at december 31 2010 an increase of 171200 members from 101900 at december 31 2009 medicare advantage per member premiums increased approximately 15 during 2010 compared to 2009 medicare standalone pdp premium revenues decreased 74 million or 03 during 2010 compared to 2009 the decrease primarily was due to declines in average pdp membership of 94 from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 partially offset by increases in medicare standalone pdp per member premiums of 10 during 2010 compared to 2009 the decline in standalone pdp membership principally resulted from our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience 

commercial segment premium revenues decreased 1931 million or 27 to 69 billion for 2010 the decrease primarily was due to a decline in fullyinsured membership partially offset by an increase in per member premiums fullyinsured membership decreased 96 or 176100 members to 1663400 at december 31 2010 compared to 1839500 at december 31 2009 primarily due to continued pricing discipline per member premiums for fullyinsured group accounts increased 76 during 2010 compared to 2009 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees were 5082 million for 2010 an increase of 121 million or 24 from 4961 million for 2009 primarily due to a new group medicare aso account in 2010 partially offset by a decline in commercial aso membership of 117700 members from december 31 2009 to december 31 2010 primarily reflecting the loss of a large group account on july 1 2010 

investment income 

investment income totaled 3293 million for 2010 an increase of 330 million from 2963 million for 2009 primarily reflecting higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flows partially offset by lower interest rates 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 3183 million for 2010 an increase of 771 million from 2412 million for 2009 the increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to right sourcerx sm  our mailorder pharmacy 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expense was 271 billion for 2010 an increase of 23 billion or 93 from 248 billion for 2009 the increase primarily was driven by an increase in the average number of medicare advantage members 

  

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2010 was 828 which was equivalent to the 2009 ratio 

the government segment’s benefit expenses increased 26 billion or 137 in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the average number of medicare advantage members the government segment’s benefit ratio for 2010 was 839 a 40 basis point increase from 835 for 2009 primarily driven by a 60 basis point increase in the medicare benefit ratio the increase in the benefit ratio resulted from growth in our medicare advantage group business which generally carries a higher benefit ratio than our individual medicare advantage business partially offset by prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of an estimated 1824 million in 2010 these favorable reserve releases decreased the government segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2010 

the commercial segment’s benefit expenses decreased 2945 million or 51 during 2010 compared to 2009 the decrease primarily was due to lower utilization a decline in fullyinsured membership and prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of an estimated 488 million in 2010 partially offset by a net charge of 1389 million associated with reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care policies in 2010 fullyinsured membership decreased 96 or 176100 members to 1663400 at december 31 2010 compared to 1839500 at december 31 2009 primarily due to continued pricing discipline the benefit ratio for the commercial segment of 786 for 2010 decreased 200 basis points from the 2009 benefit ratio of 806 the decrease primarily was due to medical trend that was lower than trend assumed in pricing continued pricing discipline and prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business in 2010 partially offset by reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care policies in 2010 medical trend was favorable primarily affected by lower utilization of services as well as the use of services at lower levels of intensity than prior year the favorable reserve releases decreased the commercial segment benefit ratio by approximately 70 basis points in 2010 while the reserve strengthening for our closed block of longterm care policies increased the commercial segment benefit ratio by 200 basis points in 2010 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 4353 million or 103 during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the 1475 million writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies in 2010 increased medicare investment spending for our 2011 offerings and administrative costs associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership partially offset by a decrease in the number of our employees as a result of our administrative cost reduction strategies including planned workforce reductions in 2010 excluding employees added with the acquisition of concentra on december 21 2010 the number of employees decreased by 800 to 27300 at december 31 2010 from 28100 at december 31 2009 or 28 as we aligned the size of our workforce with our membership 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2010 was 139 increasing 10 basis points from 138 for 2009 the increase primarily was due to an increase in the commercial segment sga expense ratio as described below 

our government and commercial segments incur both direct and shared indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 2426 million or 103 during 2010 compared to 2009 the increase primarily was due to administrative costs associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership as well as increased medicare investment spending for our 2011 offerings the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 30 basis points from 103 for 2009 to 100 for 2010 primarily due to efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership as well as our continued focus on administrative cost reductions 

  

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 1927 million or 103 during 2010 compared to 2009 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 290 basis points from 241 for 2009 to 270 for 2010 the increase in sga expenses for 2010 primarily was due to a 1475 million writedown of deferred acquisition costs associated with our individual major medical policies which increased the sga expense ratio 190 basis points in 2010 in addition the increases in 2010 primarily reflect administrative costs associated with increased specialty and mailorder pharmacy business partially offset by our continued focus on administrative cost reductions

income taxes 

our effective tax rate during 2010 was 372 compared to the effective tax rate of 351 in 2009 the increase from 2009 to 2010 primarily was due to the reduction of the 168 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements which reduced the effective income tax rate by 10 during 2009 in addition the tax rate for 2010 reflects the estimated impact of new limitations on the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of 500000 per employee as mandated by recent health insurance reforms see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate we expect the 2011 effective tax rate to be approximately 37

 these tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows 

summary 

net income was 10397 million or 615 per diluted common share in 2009 compared to 6472 million or 383 per diluted common share in 2008 the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects higher operating earnings in our government segment as a result of significantly lower prescription drug claims expenses associated with our medicare standalone pdp products 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 18 billion or 66 to 299 billion for 2009 compared to 281 billion for 2008 primarily due to higher premium revenues in the government segment premium revenues reflected changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums included changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 18 billion or 88 to 228 billion for 2009 compared to 210 billion for 2008 primarily attributable to higher average medicare advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums partially offset by a decrease in our medicare standalone pdp membership 

  

average medicare advantage membership increased 115 in 2009 compared to 2008 including the impact from the 2008 acquisitions of cariten metcare osf and securehorizons discussed previously sales of our ppo products drove the majority of the 72600 increase in medicare advantage members since december 31 2008 medicare advantage per member premiums increased 68 during 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the effect of introducing member premiums for most of our medicare advantage products medicare standalone pdp premium revenues decreased 11 billion or 311 during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 1138700 or 371 decrease in pdp membership since december 31 2008 principally resulting from our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience 

commercial segment premium revenues increased 165 million or 02 to 71 billion for 2009 primarily due to the acquisitions of osf and cariten in the second and fourth quarters of 2008 respectively and an increase in per member premiums substantially offset by a decline in fullyinsured membership per member premiums for fullyinsured group accounts increased 50 during 2009 compared to 2008 fullyinsured membership decreased 70 or 139300 members to 1839500 at december 31 2009 compared to 1978800 at december 31 2008 primarily due to the impact of the economic recession which has led to increased ingroup member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees were 4961 million for 2009 an increase of 442 million or 98 from 4519 million for 2008 primarily due to an increase in per member fees partially offset by a decline in commercial aso membership primarily isolated to the loss of two larger aso accounts 

investment income 

investment income totaled 2963 million for 2009 an increase of 761 million from 2202 million for 2008 primarily reflecting net realized losses in 2008 of 794 million compared to net realized gains of 195 million in 2009 net realized losses in 2008 primarily resulted from otherthantemporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios of 1031 million excluding the change associated with net realized gainslosses investment income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flow 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 2412 million for 2009 an increase of 318 million from 2094 million for 2008 the increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to right sourcerx sm  our mailorder pharmacy 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expense was 248 billion for 2009 an increase of 11 billion or 45 from 237 billion for 2008 the increase primarily was driven by an increase in government segment benefit expense as described below 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2009 was 828 a 170 basis point decrease from 845 for 2008 the decrease primarily was attributable to a decrease in the government segment benefit ratio as described below 

the government segment’s benefit expenses increased 10 billion or 57 during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in the average number of medicare advantage members and the impact from the acquisitions of cariten metcare osf and securehorizons the government segment’s benefit ratio for 2009 was 835 a 240 basis point decrease from 2008 of 859 primarily driven by a 320 basis point decline in the 

  

medicare benefit ratio the decline in the medicare benefit ratio primarily resulted from a substantial decline in medicare standalone pdp benefit expenses as a result of our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience 

the commercial segment’s benefit expenses increased 363 million or 06 during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the osf and cariten acquisitions in the second and fourth quarters of 2008 respectively the benefit ratio for the commercial segment of 806 for 2009 increased 30 basis points from the 2008 benefit ratio of 803 primarily reflecting higher utilization associated with the general economy and the highly competitive environment as well as the impact of the h1n1 virus partially offset by an increase in per member premiums we experienced higher utilization of benefits in our fullyinsured group accounts as ingroup attrition primarily as a result of reductions of less experienced workers has led to a shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs members seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met and increased cobra participation 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 2829 million or 72 during 2009 compared to 2008 the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average number of our employees due to the medicare growth and higher average individual product membership the average number of our employees increased 1600 to 28500 for 2009 from 26900 for 2008 or 59 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2009 was 138 increasing 10 basis points from 137 for 2008 primarily due to an increase in the commercial segment sga expense ratio as discussed below 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 1370 million or 62 during 2009 compared to 2008 the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 30 basis points from 106 for 2008 to 103 for 2009 the decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership for example during 2009 we transitioned the recently acquired osf and metcare members into our primary medicare service platform and eliminated the cost of having duplicate platforms 

commercial segment sga expenses increased 1459 million or 85 during 2009 compared to 2008 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 170 basis points from 224 for 2008 to 241 for 2009 the increase primarily was due to administrative costs associated with increased business for our mailorder pharmacy and higher average individual product membership average individual product membership increased 176 during 2009 compared to 2008 individual accounts bear a higher sga expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2009 totaled 2503 million compared to 2204 million for 2008 an increase of 299 million or 136 primarily reflecting depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures since december 31 2008 

interest expense 

interest expense was 1058 million for 2009 compared to 803 million for 2008 an increase of 255 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement the weighted average effective interest rate for all of our longterm debt was 597 for 2009 and 473 for 2008 

  

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2009 of 351 compared to the effective tax rate of 348 for 2008 the increase was due to a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income substantially offset by the reduction of the 168 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of audit settlements see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums aso fees and investment and other income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments sga expenses interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures repayments on borrowings and share repurchases because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital 

cash and cash equivalents increased to 16731 million at december 31 2010 from 16136 million at december 31 2009 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash flow from operating activities 

the increase in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings enrollment activity and changes in working capital items cash flows were positively impacted by medicare enrollment gains in 2010 because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months conversely during 2009 cash flows were negatively impacted by the payment of runoff claims associated with enrollment losses in our standalone pdp business our 2008 operating cash flows and earnings were impacted by significantly higher prescription drug claim payments for our medicare standalone pdps 

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of payments of benefit expenses and receipts for premiums we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of benefits payable and receivables 

  

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

  

    the increase in benefits payable in 2010 and 2009 primarily was due to an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements as well as an increase in ibnr both primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth partially offset by a decrease in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to the monthend cutoff the increase in benefits payable in 2008 primarily was due to the increase in ibnr from growth in medicare advantage members and to a lesser extent benefit claims inflation an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff and an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements from medicare advantage membership growth 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

   

military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees the claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the 265 million decrease in base receivables for 2010 as compared to 2009 and the 152 million and 314 million increase in base receivables for 2009 as compared to 2008 and 2008 as compared to 2007 respectively 

medicare receivables are impacted by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

commercial and other receivables for 2010 include 1086 million of patient services receivables acquired with the acquisition of concentra in december 2010 excluding the receivables acquired with concentra the timing of reimbursements from the puerto rico health insurance administration for our medicaid business resulted in the increase in commercial and other receivables for 2010 as compared to 2009 

in addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and payments of benefit expenses other working capital items impacting operating cash flows over the past three years primarily resulted from the timing of payments for the medicare part d risk corridor provisions of our contracts with cms as well as changes in the timing of collections of pharmacy rebates 

cash flow from investing activities 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily fixed income securities totaling 8270 million in 2010 19752 million in 2009 and 6855 million in 2008 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections wellness solutions care coordination regulatory compliance and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 2223 million in 2010 1855 million in 2009 and 2616 million in 2008 increased capital spending in 2008 included expenditures associated with constructing a new data center building and mailorder pharmacy warehouse we expect total capital expenditures in 2011 of approximately 280 million reflecting increased spending due to the concentra acquisition cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 8325 million in 2010 124 million in 2009 and 4229 million in 2008 primarily related to the concentra acquisition in 2010 and the securehorizons osf and cariten acquisitions in 2008 

cash flow from financing activities 

receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were 2372 million less than claims payments during 2010 4935 million higher than claim payments during 2009 and 1887 million higher than claims payments during 2008 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

during 2010 we repurchased 199 million shares for 1000 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors in december 2009 during 2009 there were no repurchases of common shares under stock repurchase plans authorized by the board of directors during 2008 we repurchased 210 million common shares for 928 million under a stock repurchase plan previously authorized by the board of directors we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 85 million in 2010 228 million in 2009 and 133 million in 2008 

in 2009 net borrowings under our then existing credit agreement decreased 2500 million primarily from the repayment of amounts borrowed to fund the acquisition of cariten during 2008 the net repayment of 550 million under our credit agreement primarily related to amounts repaid from the issuance of 750 million in senior notes offset by the 250 million financing of the cariten acquisition 

  

in june 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 our net proceeds reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering were 7426 million we used the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our then existing credit agreement 

in exchange for terminating interestrate swap agreements in 2008 we received cash of 930 million 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2010 2009 and 2008 primarily resulted from the change in the securities lending payable the decrease in securities lending since 2008 resulted from lower margins earned under the program 

future sources and uses of liquidity 

stock repurchase authorization 

in december 2009 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans under this share repurchase authorization shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases or in privatelynegotiated transactions subject to certain regulatory restrictions on volume pricing and timing during 2010 we repurchased 199 million shares in open market transactions for 1000 million at an average price of 5017 as of february 4 2011 the remaining authorized amount totaled 1500 million and the authorization expires on december 31 2011 

senior notes 

during 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 the 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances we also previously issued 300 million of 630 senior notes due august 1 2018 and 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 all four series of our senior notes which are unsecured may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified makewhole amount concurrent with the senior notes issuances we entered into interestrate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor during 2008 we terminated all of our swap agreements we may reenter into interestrate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

in december 2010 we replaced our 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which was set to expire in july 2011 with a 3year 10 billion unsecured revolving agreement expiring december 2013 under the new credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either libor or the base rate plus a spread the spread currently 200 basis points varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 150 to 2625 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 375 basis points may fluctuate between 25 and 625 basis points depending upon our credit ratings the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option 

the terms of the new credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse event clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds in 

  

addition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of 52579 million at december 31 2010 and a maximum leverage ratio of 301 we are in compliance with the financial covenants with actual net worth of 69241 million and a leverage ratio of 081 as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of december 31 2010 in addition the new credit agreement includes an uncommitted 250 million incremental loan facility 

at december 31 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement we have outstanding letters of credit of 104 million secured under the credit agreement no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit accordingly as of december 31 2010 we had 9896 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement 

other longterm borrowings 

other longterm borrowings of 370 million at december 31 2010 represent junior subordinated debt of 361 million and financing for the renovation of a building of 09 million the junior subordinated debt which is due in 2037 may be called by us without penalty in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 802 payable quarterly until 2012 and then payable at a floating rate based on libor plus 310 basis points the debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 200 is collateralized by the building and is payable in various installments through 2014 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months as well as to refinance or repay debt and repurchase shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2010 was bbb according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 19 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 75 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry the parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company decreased 1120 million to 5536 million at december 31 2010 compared to 6656 million at december 31 2009 primarily due to cash paid for the concentra acquisition partially offset by dividends from our subsidiaries we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries during 2010 our subsidiaries paid dividends of 7466 million to the parent compared to 7741 million in 2009 and 2960 million in 2008 in addition the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of 2300 million in 2010 compared to 1323 million in 2009 and 2428 million in 2008 the parent paid cash to fund acquisitions of 8396 million in 2010 59 million in 2009 and 5663 million in 2008 primarily related to the concentra acquisition in 2010 and the securehorizons osf and cariten acquisitions in 2008 

  

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level our state regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately 43 billion and 38 billion as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively which exceeded aggregate minimum regulatory requirements the amount of dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2011 without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is approximately 740 million in the aggregate this compares to dividends that were able to be paid in 2010 without prior regulatory approval of approximately 720 million 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2010 as follows 

 

  

      

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2010 we are not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

related parties 

no related party transactions had a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 21 2011 appearing under the caption “certain transactions with management and others” of such proxy statement 

government contracts 

our medicare business which accounted for approximately 65 of our total premiums and administrative services only or aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily consisted of products covered under the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan contracts with the federal government these contracts are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare business have been renewed for 2011 

cms uses a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity the riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under this model rates paid to medicare advantage plans are based on actuarially determined bids which include a process whereby our prospective payments are based on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s original medicare program under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans we generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims 

  

cms is continuing to perform audits of various companies’ selected medicare advantage contracts related to this risk adjustment diagnosis data these audits are referred to herein as riskadjustment data validation audits or radv audits radv audits review medical record documentation in an attempt to validate provider coding practices and the presence of risk adjustment conditions which influence the calculation of premium payments to medicare advantage plans to date six humana contracts have been selected by cms for radv audits for the 2007 contract year consisting of one “pilot” audit and five “targeted” audits for humana plans 

on december 21 2010 cms posted a description of the agency’s proposed radv sampling and payment adjustment calculation methodology to its website and invited public comment noting that cms may revise its sampling and payment error calculation methodology based upon the comments received we believe the audit and payment adjustment methodology proposed by cms is fundamentally flawed and actuarially unsound in essence in making the comparison referred to above cms relies on two interdependent sets of data to set payment rates for medicare advantage ma plans 1 fee for service ffs data from the government’s original medicare program and 2 ma data the proposed methodology would review medical records for only one set of data ma data while not performing the same exercise on the other set ffs data however because these two sets of data are inextricably linked we believe cms must audit and validate both of them before extrapolating any potential radv audit results in order to ensure that any resulting payment adjustment is accurate we believe that the social security act under which the payment model was established requires the consistent use of these data sets in determining riskadjusted payments to ma plans furthermore our payment received from cms as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members is based on bids that did not by cms design include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments we believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after cms acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums 

cms has received public comments including our comments and comments from other industry participants and the american academy of actuaries which expressed concerns about the failure to appropriately compare the two sets of data on february 3 2011 cms issued a statement that it was closely evaluating the comments it has received on this matter and anticipates making changes to the proposed methodology based on input it has received although we are unable to predict the extent of changes that they may make 

we believe that the proposed methodology is actuarially unsound and in violation of the social security act we intend to defend that position vigorously however if cms moves forward with implementation of the proposed methodology without changes to adequately address the data inconsistency issues described above it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues derived from the medicare advantage program and therefore our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 2 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico effective october 1 2010 the puerto rico health insurance administration or prhia awarded us three contracts for the east southeast and southwest regions for a one year term with two options to extend the contracts for an additional term of up to one year exercisable at the sole discretion of the prhia 

the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our military services business which accounted for approximately 11 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily consists of the tricare south region contract the original 5year south region contract expired on march 31 2009 and was extended through march 31 2011 on october 5 2010 we were notified that the department of defense tricare management activity or tma 

  

intended to negotiate with us for an extension of our administration of the tricare south region contract and on january 6 2011 an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract in the form of an undefinitized contract action became effective the amendment adds one additional oneyear option period option period ix which runs from april 1 2011 through march 31 2012 the amendment does not include the costs of the underwritten target health care cost and underwritten health care target fee which will be negotiated separately on january 21 2011 the tma notified us of their intent to exercise option period ix 

as required under the current contract the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for option period ix will be negotiated separately any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts any failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in july 2009 we were notified by the department of defense or dod that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the government accountability office or gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest on october 22 2010 tma issued its latest amendment to the request for proposal requesting from offerors final proposal revisions to address among other things health care cost savings resulting from provider network discounts in the south region we submitted our final proposal revisions on november 9 2010 at this time we are not able to determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

benefit expense recognition 

benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 

 

 military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data this amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government as more fullydescribed beginning on page 56 

estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results of operations and overall financial position accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” as such we expect that substantially all of the december 31 2010 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2011 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing changes in medical management processes product mix and weekday seasonality 

  

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including receipt cycle times claim inventory levels recoveries of overpayments outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years for example the average receipt cycle time has decreased from 150 days in 2008 to 138 days in 2010 which represents an 80 reduction in cycle time over the three year period if claims are submitted or processed on a faster slower pace than prior periods the actual claim may be more less complete than originally estimated using our completion factors which may result in reserves that are higher lower than required 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services new higher priced technologies and medical procedures and new prescription drugs and therapies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes the tort liability system increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population lifestyle changes including diet and smoking catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is generally less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2010 data 

 

  

   

  

 the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 

 

 the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefit expenses ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 

 

  

 as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant the amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has been impacted by the growth in our medicare business coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices when we recognize a release of the redundancy we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business if material during 2010 we experienced prior year favorable reserve releases not in the ordinary course of business of approximately 2312 million this favorable reserve development primarily resulted from improvements in the claims processing environment and to a lesser extent better than originally estimated utilization as well as a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions the improvements in the claims processing environment benefited all lines of business but were most prominent in our medicare pffs line of business these 

  

improvements resulted in recoveries from the identification of claims billed at higher cost codes than those documented in the medical records via audits as well as an improved ability to collect overpayments due to the development of system enhancements to our commercial claims processing platform we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2010 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table 

benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 our tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk of financing health benefits the federal government both reimburses us for our cost of providing health benefits and bears responsibility for 80 of any variance from the annual target health care cost and actual health care cost as more fully described beginning on page 70 therefore the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for tricare benefits payable is reduced substantially by corresponding adjustments to revenues the net decrease to income from operations as determined retrospectively after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period was approximately 94 million for 2009 and 78 million for 2008 the impact from changes in estimates for 2010 is not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2011 will change as our december 31 2010 benefits payable estimate develops throughout 2011 

future policy benefits payable of 14929 million and 11930 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care health and life insurance policies and annuities sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the assumptions used to determine the liability for future policy benefits are established and locked in at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our expected future experience deteriorated to the point that the level of the liability together with the present value of future gross premiums are not adequate to provide for future expected policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 8246 million at december 31 2010 and 5719 million at december 31 2009 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold to the extent premium rate increases andor loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required during the fourth quarter of 2010 certain states approved premium rate increases for a large portion of our longterm care block that were significantly below our acquisition date assumptions based on these actions by the states combined with lower 

  

interest rates and higher actual expenses as compared to acquisition date assumptions we determined that our existing future policy benefits payable together with the present value of future gross premiums associated with our longterm care policies were not adequate to provide for future policy benefits under these policies therefore we unlocked and modified our assumptions based on current expectations accordingly during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded 1389 million of additional benefit expense with a corresponding increase in future policy benefits payable of 1703 million partially offset by a related reinsurance recoverable of 314 million included in other longterm assets in addition future policy benefits payable include amounts of 2189 million at december 31 2010 and 2250 million at december 31 2009 which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay and beginning january 1 2011 for estimated rebates to policyholders under the minimum benefit ratios required under the health insurance reform legislation enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and members in our medicare and individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from cms for our medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare part d provisions 

we cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d under multiple contracts with cms the payments we receive monthly from cms and members which are determined from our annual bid represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage we recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract our cms payment is subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions in addition we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk as described more fully below 

the risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion 

  

of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period accordingly this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience we record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or longterm in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement 

the estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain at period end including member eligibility and risk adjustment score differences with cms as well as pharmacy rebates from manufacturers these factors have an offsetting effect on changes in the risk corridor estimate in 2010 we paid 1802 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2009 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 1446 million at december 31 2009 in 2009 we received net proceeds of 596 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2008 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 554 million at december 31 2008 the net liability associated with the 2010 risk corridor estimate which will be settled in 2011 was 3876 million at december 31 2010 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent funding from cms for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and related settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year we account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize premium revenues or benefit expense for these subsidies receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period gross financing receipts were 17572 million and gross financing withdrawals were 19944 million during 2010 cms subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2010 was 162 million to other current assets and 1702 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 

in order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage cms provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage or coverage beyond cms’s defined standard benefits the demonstration payment option available to plans through 2010 was an arrangement in which cms agreed to pay a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government’s portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage the capitation amount represented a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer we chose the demonstration payment option for some of our plans that offered enhanced coverage over the last three years this capitation amount derived from our annual bid submissions was recorded as premium revenue the variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer was subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms utilizes a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to medicare advantage plans according to health severity a riskadjustment model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under the riskadjustment methodology all medicare advantage plans must collect and submit the necessary 

  

diagnosis code information from hospital inpatient hospital outpatient and physician providers to cms within prescribed deadlines the cms riskadjustment model uses this diagnosis data to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to medicare advantage plans rates paid to medicare advantage plans are established under an actuarial bid model including a process whereby our payments are based on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s original medicare program we generally rely on providers to code their claim submissions with appropriate diagnoses which we send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model we also rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including the diagnosis data submitted with claims we estimate riskadjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms the riskadjustment model is more fully described in item 1—business beginning on page 6 

military services 

in 2010 military services revenues represented approximately 11 of total premiums and administrative services fees military services revenue primarily is derived from our tricare south region contract with the department of defense the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities we allocate the consideration to the various components of the contract based on the relative fair value of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative services fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

the tricare south region contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target health care cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance of actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses we continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

the military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

  

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 83724 million or 52 of total assets at december 31 2010 and 74972 million or 53 of total assets at december 31 2009 debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2010 and at december 31 2009 the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 approximately 96 of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2010 most of the debt securities that were below investmentgrade were rated bb the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

taxexempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 3439 million at december 31 2010 and 3469 million at december 31 2009 these prerefunded bonds were secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations aaa by sp at the time the fund is established in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our taxexempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 5972 million and 5872 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively of taxexempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa 

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was 34 million at december 31 2010 and 55 million at december 31 2009 there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio 

the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 294 at december 31 2010 and 373 at december 31 2009 

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 46 years at december 31 2010 including cash equivalents the average duration was approximately 40 years based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 395 million 

  

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2010 

 

 in april 2009 the financial accounting standards board or the fasb issued new guidance to address concerns about 1 measuring the fair value of financial instruments when the markets become inactive and quoted prices may reflect distressed transactions and 2 recording impairment charges on investments in debt securities the new guidance highlighted and expanded on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for a financial asset or liability has significantly decreased and required new disclosures relating to fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques including changes in inputs and valuation techniques in addition new guidance regarding recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments changed 1 the trigger for determining whether an otherthantemporary impairment exists and 2 the amount of an impairment charge to be recorded in earnings we adopted the provisions of the new guidance for the quarter ended june 30 2009 refer to note 4 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for disclosures related to the implementation of the new guidance 

under the revised otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairment is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of 

  

the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

the recoverability of our residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities is supported by factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements our residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities at december 31 2010 primarily were composed of senior tranches having high credit support with 99 of the collateral consisting of prime loans all commercial mortgagebacked securities were rated aa at december 31 2010 

all issuers of securities we own that were trading at an unrealized loss at december 31 2010 remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased at december 31 2010 we did not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss were not otherthantemporarily impaired at december 31 2010 

there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2010 or 2009 gross realized losses in 2008 included otherthantemporary impairments of 1031 million primarily due to investments in lehman brothers holdings inc and certain of its subsidiaries which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008 as well as declines in the values of securities primarily associated with the financial services industry 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2010 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 23 of total assets and 55 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 21 and 50 respectively at december 31 2009 

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable commercial and government segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

  

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and administrative cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the ultimate outcome of health care reform legislation the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a margin ranging from approximately 68 to 107 a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease this margin to a range of approximately 43 to 84 

the ultimate loss of the tricare south region contract would adversely affect 498 million of the military services reporting unit’s goodwill in july 2009 we were notified by the dod that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the gao in connection with the award to another contractor and in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest on october 22 2010 tma issued its latest amendment to the request for proposal requesting from offerors final proposal revisions to address among other things health care cost savings resulting from provider network discounts in the south region we submitted our final proposal revisions on november 9 2010 at this time we are not able to determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

on october 5 2010 we were notified that the tma intended to negotiate with us for an extension of our administration of the tricare south region contract scheduled to end on march 31 2011 and on january 6 2011 an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract in the form of an undefinitized contract action became effective the amendment adds one additional oneyear option period option period ix which runs from april 1 2011 through march 31 2012 on january 21 2011 the tma notified us of their intent to exercise option period ix we will continue to assess the fair value of our military services reporting unit each reporting period based on our estimate of future discounted cash flows associated with the reporting unit primarily derived from cash flows associated with the tricare south region contract we will recognize a goodwill impairment if and when our impairment test indicates that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value if we are not ultimately awarded the new third generation tricare program contract for the south region we expect that as the march 31 2012 contract end date nears future cash flows will not be sufficient to warrant recoverability of all or a portion of the military services goodwill in this event we expect a goodwill impairment would occur during the second half of 2011 refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the tricare south region contract 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these 

  

estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no material impairment losses in the last three years longlived assets associated with our military services business are not material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense until october 7 2008 we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements as a result changes in interest rates generally resulted in an increase or decrease to investment income partially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase to interest expense partially hedging our exposure to interest rate risk however due to extreme volatility in the securities and credit markets libor increased while the interest rate we would earn on invested assets like cash and cash equivalents decreased as a result we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements fixing the average interest rate under our senior notes at 608 in exchange for terminating our rights under the interest rate swap agreements we received 930 million in cash from the counterparties representing the fair value of the swap assets we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either libor or the base rate plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2010 or december 31 2009 

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with an average sp credit rating of aa at december 31 2010 our net unrealized position improved 1251 million from a net unrealized gain position of 714 million at december 31 2009 to a net unrealized gain position of 1965 million at december 31 2010 at december 31 2010 we had gross unrealized losses of 620 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased and as such there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2010 while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that future declines in fair value may occur and material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 40 years as of december 31 2010 based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 395 million 

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2010 and 2009 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not 

  

account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points four times and have changed by less than 100 basis points four times

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a—risk factors for a description of a number of factors that may adversely affect our results or business 

business segments 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals when identifying our segments we aggregated products 

  

with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

our products 

as more fully described in the products discussion that follows we provide health insurance benefits under health maintenance organization or hmo private feeforservice or pffs and preferred provider organization or ppo plans in addition we provide other benefits with our specialty products including dental vision and other supplementary benefits the following table presents our segment membership at december 31 2009 and premiums and administrative services only or aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2009 

 

   

our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries 

medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 20 years and have established a national presence offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states the resulting growing membership base provides us with greater ability to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care including cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes that result in living healthier 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance prescription drug benefits are provided under part d cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program 

medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original medicare typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions disease management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium since 2006 medicare beneficiaries have had more health plan options including a prescription drug benefit option most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in most cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

our medicare pffs plans generally have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to traditional medicare payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the adequacy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital 

  

inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms transitioned to this riskbased payment model while the old payment model based on demographic data including gender age and disability status was phased out the phasein of risk adjusted payment was completed in 2007 under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

commensurate with the phasein of the riskadjustment methodology payments to medicare advantage plans were increased by a “budget neutrality” factor the budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced during the transition from the previous payment model based upon average original medicare feeforservice spending to the riskadjustment payment model the budget neutrality adjustment began phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by 2011 

at december 31 2009 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 1508500 medicare advantage members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 164 billion or 540 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 under our medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 377900 members these contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately 52 billion which represented approximately 318 of our medicare advantage premium revenues or 171 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 

our hmo pffs and ppo products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage business have been renewed for 2010 

medicare standalone prescription drug products 

we offer standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between november 15 and december 31 for coverage that begins january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described beginning on page 60 our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp business have been renewed for 2010 

medicare standalone pdp premium revenues were approximately 23 billion or 76 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 

medicaid product 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a statespecific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we 

  

receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

our medicaid business which accounted for premium revenues of approximately 6462 million or 21 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico 

military services 

under our tricare south region contract with the united states department of defense or dod we provide health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in a hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers similar to a ppo 

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 30 million eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2009 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense of these eligible beneficiaries 13 million were tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries seniors over the age of 65 and beneficiaries in puerto rico for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract the original 5year south region contract expired march 31 2009 through an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract an additional oneyear option period the sixth option period which runs from april 1 2009 through march 31 2010 was exercised by the government the amendment also provides for two additional sixmonth option periods the seventh option period runs from april 1 2010 through september 30 2010 and the eighth option period runs from october 1 2010 through march 31 2011 exercise of each of the seventh and eighth option periods is at the government’s option on december 16 2009 we were notified by department of defense tricare management activity or tma that it intends to exercise its options to extend the tricare south region contract for option period vii and option period viii the exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the tricare south region contract through march 31 2011 the contract’s transition provisions require the continuation of certain activities primarily claims processing during a winddown period lasting approximately six months following the expiration date claims incurred on or prior to the expiration date would continue to be processed during the winddown period under the terms existing prior to the expiration date 

the tricare south region contract contains provisions that require us to negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments 

in july 2009 we were notified by the department of defense that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the government accountability office or gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our 

  

record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest at this time we are not able to determine what actions tma will take in response to recommendations by the gao nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

for the year ended december 31 2009 military services premium revenues were approximately 34 billion or 113 of our total premiums and aso fees and military services aso fees totaled 1084 million or 03 of our total premiums and aso fees the tricare south region contract represents approximately 97 of total military services premiums and aso fees 

international operations 

in august 2006 we established our subsidiary humana europe in the united kingdom to provide commissioning support to primary care trusts or pcts in england under the contracts we are awarded we work in partnership with local pcts health care providers and patients to strengthen healthservice delivery and to implement strategies at a local level to help the national health service enhance patient experience improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs for the year ended december 31 2009 revenues under these contracts were approximately 90 million or less than 01 of our total premium and aso fees 

our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members 

we offer medical and specialty benefits to employer groups and individuals in the commercial market our commercial medical products offered as hmo ppo or aso more fully described in the following sections include offerings designed to provide additional options to the consumer for example our “smart” products give more cost control and predictability to employers and more choice and control over healthcare decisionmaking to employees online tools and resources deliver information convenience and easy access for members enrolled in our smart products our other consumer offerings include products with a high deductible offering in conjunction with a spending account 

hmo 

our commercial hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan 

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers together with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician we participate in the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp primarily with our hmo offering in certain markets fehbp is the government’s health insurance program for federal employees retirees former employees family members and spouses for the year ended december 31 2009 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 30 billion or 99 of our total premiums and aso fees 

ppo 

our commercial ppo products which are marketed primarily to employer groups and individuals include some types of wellness and utilization management programs however they typically include more costsharing 

  

with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees 

as part of our ppo products we offer humanaone a major medical product marketed directly to individuals we offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels this individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses 

for the year ended december 31 2009 employer and individual commercial ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 32 billion or 105 of our total premiums and aso fees 

aso 

we also offer aso products to employers who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fullyinsured ppo or hmo products described previously under aso contracts selffunded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits however most aso customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs for the year ended december 31 2009 commercial aso fees totaled 3734 million or 12 of our total premiums and aso fees 

specialty 

we also offer various specialty products including dental vision and other supplemental products as well as disease management services under corphealth inc dba lifesynch and mailorder pharmacy benefit administration services for our members under humana pharmacy inc dba right sourcerx sm  during 2007 we made investments which significantly expanded our specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of compbenefits corporation and kmg america corporation these acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings including vision and other supplemental health and life products the supplemental health plans cover for example some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness other supplemental health products also include a closed block of approximately 36000 longterm care policies acquired in connection with the kmg acquisition no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block at december 31 2009 we had approximately 72 million specialty members including 38 million dental members and 25 million vision members for the year ended december 31 2009 specialty product premiums and aso fees were approximately 9423 million or 31 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2009 by market and product 

 

 provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met our hospitalist programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

  

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

capitation 

for approximately 24 of our medical membership at december 31 2009 we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefit ratio the benefit ratio measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

for approximately 57 of our medical membership at december 31 2009 we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for services rendered we share hospital and other benefit expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 capitation expense as a percentage of total benefit expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

   

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health care effectiveness data and information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate health plans based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

physicians participating in our networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our health plans from ncqa the accreditation association for ambulatory health care and the utilization review accreditation commission or urac urac performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa performs reviews of our compliance with standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management member connections and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in all of our commercial hmopos markets except puerto rico in all of our medicare hmo markets with the exception of illinois which will be surveyed in 2010 and for nearly all our ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our medicare medicaid and commercial products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 1700 sales representatives as well as approximately 900 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with state farm ® and united services automobile association or usaa commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure approved by cms 

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and 

  

specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we also offer commercial health insurance and specialty products directly to individuals 

at december 31 2009 we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 1200 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics including certain other incentives for our commercial brokers these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

underwriting 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a description of all of the material current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

  

other 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses

 item 1a risk factors tableend if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of benefit expenses are inadequate our profitability may be materially adversely affected we estimate the costs of our benefit expense payments and design and price our products accordingly using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon among other relevant factors claim payment patterns medical cost inflation and historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns these estimates however involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive to changes in payment patterns and medical cost trends 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments to providers predetermined amounts paid to cover services and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including life insurance annuities health and longterm care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables as modified based upon actual experience the basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time each contract is acquired and would 

  

only change if our experience deteriorates to the point the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 5719 million at december 31 2009 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold we filed and received approval for certain state premium rate increases in 2009 and continue to expect to file for premium rate increases for additional states in 2010 however to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program as well as in smart products and other consumer health plans such as high deductible health plans with health savings accounts hsas we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationships with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract including the possible termination of our tricare contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our business may be materially adversely affected which is of particular importance given the concentration of our revenues in the medicare business 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position us for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the expansion of our medicare programs including our hmo and ppo as well as our standalone pdp products we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs the expansion of our provider networks and our success in attracting members to our networkbased products positions us well for changes in the medicare program that will effectively eliminate the nonnetwork pffs plan option in 2011 although there can be no assurances that our pffs members will choose to move to our networkbased products we are continuing to implement various operational and strategic initiatives including further developing our 

  

networks and building networkbased plan offerings to address the adequate network requirement we anticipate these initiatives together with certain counties’ exemption from the network requirement to result in more than 95 of our pffs members having the choice of remaining in a humana plan in 2011 over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia 

the growth of our medicare business is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the medicare business there is significant concentration of our revenues in the medicare business with approximately 62 of our total premiums and aso fees in 2009 generated from our medicare business these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream and increased risks associated with operating in a highly regulated industry as discussed further below 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business with emphasis on our aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including our smart products and other consumer offerings such as hsas and our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products as well as the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives including outsourcing certain business functions that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business may be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which may adversely affect our operating results 

  

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry including litigation involving end users of software products we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents providers and other stakeholders through webenabled technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought 

while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be 

  

enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see “legal proceedings” in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty 

our business activities are subject to substantial government regulation new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their manner of application could increase our cost of doing business and may adversely affect our business profitability and financial condition in addition as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that may adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs our government segment accounted for approximately 75 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

 

  

   

 in july 2009 we were notified by the dod that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest at this time we are not able to determine what actions tma will take in response to recommendations by the gao nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award for 2009 premiums and aso fees associated with the tricare south region contract were 34 billion or 112 of our total premiums and aso fees we are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill which had a carrying value of 498 million at december 31 2009 potential exit costs possible asset sales and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2009 

 

 our medicaid contracts with the prhia for the east and southeast regions were extended through december 31 2009 with no change in terms the prhia has confirmed its intention to extend the current contracts until june 30 2010 with no changes in terms and is in the process of executing such extensions the loss of these contracts or significant changes in the puerto rico medicaid program as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

  

 cms is continuing to perform audits of selected medicare advantage plans of various companies to validate the provider coding practices and resulting economics under the actuarial riskadjustment model used to calculate the individual member capitation paid to medicare advantage plans several humana contracts have been selected by cms for audit and we expect that cms will continue conducting audits for the 2007 contract year and beyond we are unable to estimate the financial impact of any audits that may be conducted related to 2007 revenue and beyond and whether any findings 

  

would cause a change to our method of estimating future premium revenue in bid submissions made to cms for future contract years or compromise premium rate assumptions made in our bids for prior contract years at this time we do not know whether cms will require payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to original medicare coding and using its method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract however if cms requires payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to original medicare coding and using a method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract and if we are unable to obtain any relief preventing the payment adjustments from being implemented we believe that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

 because of the unsettled nature of these initiatives and the numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what health insurance initiatives if any will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on our business however legislative changes if enacted may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations including lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible excise tax financial position including goodwill recoverability and cash flows 

 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received known as a “risk corridor” we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms beginning in 2008 the risk corridor thresholds increased which means we bear more risk our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net payable of 1446 million at december 31 2009 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent payments for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent payments from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

  

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or payment as a lowincome or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

in addition the health care industry in general and health insurance particularly hmos and ppos are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 

the enactment of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 or mippa in july 2008 could affect our medicare operations principally beginning in 2011 sponsors of medicare advantage pffs plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans additionally mippa prohibits several different kinds of marketing activities by medicare plan sponsors and their brokers and will phase out indirect medical education or ime costs beginning in 2010 we are continuing to implement various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by mippa in addition most of our pffs enrollees reside in geographies where we have developed a provider network and offer a networked plan we will continue to develop our networks and build networkbased plan offerings to address the adequate network requirement we anticipate these initiatives together with certain counties’ exemption from the network requirement to result in more than 95 of our pffs members having the choice of remaining in a humana plan in 2011 nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates eg entities that provide services to health plans 

on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 or arra was enacted into law in addition to including a temporary subsidy for health care continuation coverage issued pursuant to the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act or cobra the arra also expands and strengthens the privacy and security provisions of hipaa and imposes additional limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information or phi among other things arra requires us and other covered entities to report any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi to any impacted individuals and to the us department of health 

  

and human services in those instances where the unauthorized activity poses a significant risk of financial reputational or other harm to the individuals and to notify the media in any states where 500 or more people are impacted by any unauthorized release or use of or access to phi arra also requires business associates to comply with certain hipaa provisions arra also establishes higher civil and criminal penalties for covered entities and business associates who fail to comply with hipaa’s provisions and requires the us department of health and human services to issue regulations implementing its privacy and security enhancements we will continue to assess the impact of these regulations on us as they are issued 

state regulation 

laws in each of the states and puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including licensing requirements policy language describing benefits mandated benefits and processes entry withdrawal or reentry into a state or market rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 

our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level based on the statutory financial statements as of december 31 2009 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 36 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries 12 billion above the aggregate 24 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 

other investigations 

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance our hmos are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health audits and investigations are also conducted by state attorneys general cms the office of the inspector general of health and human services the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor and the defense contract audit agency all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs including a limitation on our ability to market or sell products the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or changes in our business practices in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability while we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses increases or decreases in staffrelated expenses additional investment in new 

  

products including our opportunities in the medicare programs greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products acquisitions and implementation of regulatory requirements may occur from time to time 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously in 2008 we acquired unitedhealth group’s las vegas nevada individual securehorizons medicare advantage hmo business osf health plans inc metcare health plans inc and php companies inc dba cariten healthcare and in late 2007 we acquired kmg america corporation and compbenefits corporation the failure to successfully integrate these entities and businesses or failure to produce results consistent with the financial model used in the analysis of the acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may also be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business may be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas may be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a 

  

primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events may have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our pharmacy business opened in 2006 competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs and internet companies as well as other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies our pharmacy business also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation the practice of pharmacy is generally regulated at the state level by state boards of pharmacy many of the states where we deliver pharmaceuticals including controlled substances have laws and regulations that require outofstate mailorder pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy in addition some states have proposed laws to regulate online pharmacies and we may be subject to this legislation if it is passed federal agencies further regulate our pharmacy operations pharmacies must register with the us drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances in addition the fda inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs the federal trade commission also has requirements for mailorder sellers of goods the us postal service or usps has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mailorder operations the usps historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances if the usps restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail alternative means of delivery are available to us however alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive the department of transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted in the stream of commerce these regulations generally do not apply to the usps and its operations in addition we are subject to cms rules regarding the administration of our pdp plans and intercompany pricing between our pdp plans and our pharmacy business 

we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailservices pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 

changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may adversely affect our financial performance 

contracts in the prescription drug industry generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs these benchmarks include average wholesale price which is referred to as “awp” average selling price which is referred to as “asp” and wholesale acquisition cost recent events have raised uncertainties as to whether payors pharmacy providers pharmacy benefit managers or pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for medicare and medicaid programs the doj is currently conducting and the us house of representatives commerce committee has conducted an investigation into the use of awp for federal program payment and whether the use of awp has inflated drug expenditures by the medicare and medicaid programs federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the medicare and medicaid programs adoption of asp in lieu of awp as the measure for determining payment by medicare or medicaid programs for the drugs sold in our mailorder pharmacy business may reduce the revenues and gross margins of this business which may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

if we do not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels our gross margins may decline 

we have contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers or wholesalers that provide us with purchase discounts and volume rebates on certain prescription drugs dispensed through our mailorder and specialty pharmacies these discounts and volume rebates are generally passed on to clients in the form of steeper price discounts changes in existing federal or state laws or regulations or in their interpretation by courts and agencies or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to patent term extensions and purchase discount and volume rebate arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers may reduce the discounts or volume rebates we receive and materially adversely impact our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances in addition our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under recent regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

  

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 

changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the us economy continues to experience a period of recession and increased unemployment we have closely monitored the impact that this volatile economy is having on our commercial segment operations workforce reductions have caused corresponding membership losses in our fullyinsured group business continued weakness in the us economy and any resulting increases in unemployment may materially adversely affect our commercial medical membership results of operations financial position and cash flows 

additionally the continued weakness of the us economy may adversely affect the budget of individual states and of the federal government that could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military services and medicaid programs and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and other care increasing the costs of claims expenses submitted to us 

the securities and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption which may adversely affect our business 

volatility or disruption in the securities and credit markets could impact our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities sold is based upon specific identification for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income when the fair value of the debt security is less than the carrying value and we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis or if a credit loss has occurred when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otherthantemporary impairments are considered using variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data we continuously review our investment portfolios and there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthan temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and to refinance or repay debt however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions may significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

  

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

given the current economic climate our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility 

over the past two years the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility companyspecific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have caused this volatility our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including

 unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds 

we maintain the humana retirement and savings plan and the humana puerto rico 1165e retirement plan which we refer to collectively as the plans each a qualified combined retirement plan and 401k plan for the benefit of our employees through which participants can elect among other investment choices to purchase our common stock at market prices although none of the shares purchased by the plans are purchased from us but are purchased by a third party administrator on the open market it is the position of the sec that because we sponsor the plans all of the securities offered pursuant to the plans must be registered under the securities act of 1933 based upon this interpretation we recently determined that the number of shares of our common stock purchased by participants under the humana retirement and savings plan may have exceeded the number of shares registered under the registration statement covering the plan and shares purchased under the humana puerto rico 1165e retirement plan may not have been registered since these purchases were made by a third party administrator on the open market and not from us we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares pursuant to the plans we have filed registration statements on form s8 to register future sales of our common stock to participants in the plans we are in the process of determining any action we intend to take in light of this situation these shares have always been treated as outstanding for financial reporting purposes and we do not expect that the overall effect of this issuance of unregistered shares including the exercise of any applicable rescission rights by participants in the plans will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows we may also be subject to monetary fines or other regulatory sanctions as provided under applicable securities laws

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies based on our 2009 revenues of approximately 310 billion we are a fullservice benefits solutions company offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups government benefit programs and individuals as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 103 million members in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 72 million members in our specialty products 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals when identifying our segments we aggregated products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

our results are impacted by many factors but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium aso fee and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures new prescription drugs and therapies an aging population lifestyle challenges including diet and smoking the tort liability system and government regulation 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the selling general and administrative expense ratio or sga expense ratio which is computed by taking total selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues administrative services fees and other revenues represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

proposed health insurance initiatives 

the president of the united states and members of the us congress have proposed significant reforms to the us health care system in november 2009 the us house of representatives passed the affordable health care for america act and in december 2009 the us senate passed the patient protection and affordable care act which we refer to collectively as the “acts” while there are significant differences between the two acts they include for example limiting medicare advantage payment rates mandatory issuance of insurance coverage requirements that would limit the ability of health plans and insurers to vary premiums based on assessments of underlying risk stipulating annual rebates to enrollees if the amount of premium revenues expended on medical costs falls below prescribed ratios for group and individual health insurance coverage and imposing new nondeductible taxes on health insurers increasing in the aggregate from 2 billion to 10 billion annually over ten years in addition certain members of congress have proposed a singlepayer health care system a government health insurance option to compete with private plans and other expanded public health care measures various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level because of the 

  

unsettled nature of these initiatives and the numerous steps required to implement them we cannot predict what health insurance initiatives if any will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on our business however legislative changes if enacted may have a material adverse affect on our results of operations including lowering our medicare payment rates and increasing our expenses associated with the nondeductible excise tax financial position including goodwill recoverability and cash flows 

government segment 

our strategy and commitment to the medicare programs has led to significant growth medicare advantage membership increased to 1508500 members at december 31 2009 up 72600 members or 51 from 1435900 members at december 31 2008 primarily due to sales of preferred provider organization or ppo products average medicare advantage membership increased 115 in 2009 compared to 2008 including the impact from the 2008 acquisitions of cariten metcare osf and securehorizons discussed below likewise medicare advantage premium revenues have increased 191 to 164 billion for 2009 from 138 billion for 2008 recently the mix of sales has shifted increasingly to our networkbased ppo offerings which is particularly important given the enactment of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 or the act discussed more fully below medicare advantage members enrolled in networkbased products was approximately 63 at december 31 2009 compared to 51 at december 31 2008 with our ppo membership increasing 946 from december 31 2008 to december 31 2009 medicare advantage members enrolled in networkbased products increased to approximately 71 in january 2010 we expect medicare advantage membership to increase by 240000 to 260000 members or approximately 16 to 17 in 2010 

due to the enactment of the act in july 2008 beginning in 2011 sponsors of medicare advantage private feeforservice or pffs plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans we have 564200 pffs members or approximately 37 of our total medicare advantage membership at december 31 2009 down from 49 at december 31 2008 approximately 87 of our pffs members at december 31 2009 resided in geographies where we have developed a provider network and offer a networked plan we are continuing to implement various operational and strategic initiatives including further developing our networks and building networkbased plan offerings to address the adequate network requirement we anticipate these initiatives together with certain counties’ exemption from the network requirement to result in more than 95 of our pffs members having the choice of remaining in a humana plan in 2011 

final 2010 medicare advantage rates were announced by cms on april 6 2009 with an effective rate decrease for the industry of 4 to 5 based on information available at the time we filed our 2010 bids in june 2009 we believe we have effectively designed medicare advantage products that address the lower rates while continuing to remain competitive compared to both the combination of original medicare with a supplement policy as well as other medicare advantage competitors within our industry in addition we will continue to pursue our costreduction and outcomeenhancing strategies including care coordination and disease management to mitigate the adverse effects of this rate reduction on our medicare advantage members nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute operational and strategic initiatives with respect to changes in the medicare advantage program failure to execute these strategies may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we also offer medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program these plans provide varying degrees of coverage in order to offer these plans in a given year in june of the preceding year we must submit bids to cms for approval during 2008 we experienced prescription drug claim expenses for our medicare standalone pdps that were higher than we had originally assumed in the bid that we submitted to cms in june 2007 these higher claim levels for our medicare standalone pdps reflected a combination of several variances between our actuarial bid assumptions versus our experience these variances resulted from among other things differences between the actuarial utilization assumptions which are our attempts to predict members’ future utilization of drugs in the bids for one of our plans versus our actual claims 

  

experience in 2008 as well as an increase in the percentage of higher cost members these issues were addressed for 2009 based on enhancements made to our bid development and review processes our medicare standalone pdp membership declined to 1927900 members at december 31 2009 down 1138700 members or 371 from december 31 2008 resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience these actions also resulted in a substantial decline in our standalone pdp benefit ratio for 2009 compared to 2008 we expect medicare standalone pdp membership to decrease by 50000 to 100000 members or approximately 3 to 5 in 2010 as we continue to price and design benefits to correspond with our historical experience 

our quarterly government segment earnings and operating cash flows are impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins annually on january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the government segment’s benefit ratio generally improves as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

our military services business primarily consists of the tricare south region contract which covers benefits for healthcare services provided to beneficiaries through march 31 2010 on december 16 2009 we were notified by department of defense tricare management activity or tma that it intends to exercise its options to extend the tricare south region contract for option period vii and option period viii the exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the tricare south region contract through march 31 2011 in july 2009 we were notified by the department of defense that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the government accountability office or gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest at this time we are not able to determine what actions tma will take in response to recommendations by the gao nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award for 2009 premiums and aso fees associated with the tricare south region contract were 34 billion or 112 of our total premiums and aso fees we are continuing to evaluate issues associated with our military services businesses such as potential impairment of certain assets primarily consisting of goodwill which had a carrying value of 498 million at december 31 2009 potential exit costs possible asset sales and a strategic assessment of ancillary businesses goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2009 

commercial segment 

commercial segment pretax earnings impacted by the economic recession and the highly competitive environment partially offset by higher investment income decreased by 1035 million or 498 for 2009 compared to 2008 commercial segment medical membership at december 31 2009 of 3410800 decreased 210000 members or 58 from december 31 2008 the decline in membership primarily was a result of the impact of the economic recession including the loss of two larger aso accounts the economic recession has led to increased ingroup member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels primarily through reductions of less experienced workers as a result we experienced higher utilization of benefits mainly in our fullyinsured group accounts primarily due to the shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs members 

  

seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met and increased cobra participation the membership declines were partially offset by enrollment gains in our individual product a strategic area of commercial growth individual membership at december 31 2009 increased 130 from december 31 2008 this increase in individual membership together with administrative costs associated with increased business for our mailorder pharmacy led to a higher commercial segment sga expense ratio we expect commercial segment medical membership to decline by 160000 to 180000 members in 2010 

financial position 

at december 31 2009 cash cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled 91 billion or 644 of total assets with 177 of the 91 billion invested in cash and cash equivalents investment securities consist of debt securities of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating by sp of aa at december 31 2009 and an average duration of approximately 45 years including cash and cash equivalents the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 38 years we had 55 million of mortgagebacked securities associated with alta or subprime loans at december 31 2009 and no collateralized debt obligations 

our net unrealized position improved 3013 million from a net unrealized loss position of 2299 million at december 31 2008 to a net unrealized gain position of 714 million at december 31 2009 gross unrealized losses were 784 million at december 31 2009 compared to 3130 million at december 31 2008 gross unrealized gains were 1498 million at december 31 2009 compared to 832 million at december 31 2008 all issuers of securities we own trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased as of december 31 2009 we do not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized costs basis and as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss are not otherthantemporarily impaired as of december 31 2009 

during 2008 we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of 1031 million of which 687 million resulted from investments in lehman brothers holdings inc or lehman or its subsidiaries lehman and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008 the other impairments primarily relate to declines in values of securities primarily associated with the financial services industry of the 1031 million 485 million was allocated to the government segment and 546 million was allocated to the commercial segment there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2009 

we continuously review our investment portfolios there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

in addition in the fall of 2008 we terminated all fixed to variable interestrate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on recent changes in the credit market environment in exchange for terminating these interestrate swap agreements we received cash of 930 million representing the fair value of the swap assets this transaction also fixed the interest rate on our senior notes to a weightedaverage rate of 608 we may reenter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future as well as to refinance or repay debt our longterm debt consisting primarily of senior notes of 16782 million represented 225 of total capitalization at december 31 2009 declining from 303 at december 31 2008 the earliest maturity of our senior notes is in june 2016 we have available a 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in july 2011 as of december 31 2009 there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required in 2009 our subsidiaries paid dividends of 7741 million to the parent compared to 2960 million in 2008 in addition the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of 1323 million in 2009 compared to 2428 million in 2008 

based on the statutory financial statements as of december 31 2009 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 36 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries 12 billion above the aggregate 24 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 

other highlights

comparison of results of operations for 2009 and 2008 

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

  

    

ending membership was as follows at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

  

 these tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows 

summary 

net income was 10397 million or 615 per diluted common share in 2009 compared to 6472 million or 383 per diluted common share in 2008 the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects higher operating earnings in our government segment as a result of significantly lower prescription drug claims expenses associated with our medicare standalone pdp products 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 18 billion or 66 to 299 billion for 2009 compared to 281 billion for 2008 primarily due to higher premium revenues in the government segment premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 18 billion or 88 to 228 billion for 2009 compared to 210 billion for 2008 primarily attributable to higher average medicare advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums partially offset by a decrease in our medicare standalone pdp membership 

  

average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period average medicare advantage membership increased 115 in 2009 compared to 2008 including the impact from the 2008 acquisitions of cariten metcare osf and securehorizons discussed previously sales of our ppo products drove the majority of the 72600 increase in medicare advantage members since december 31 2008 medicare advantage per member premiums increased 68 during 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the effect of introducing member premiums for most of our medicare advantage products medicare standalone pdp premium revenues decreased 11 billion or 311 during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 1138700 or 371 decrease in pdp membership since december 31 2008 principally resulting from our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience 

commercial segment premium revenues increased 165 million or 02 to 71 billion for 2009 primarily due to the acquisitions of osf and cariten in the second and fourth quarters of 2008 respectively and an increase in per member premiums substantially offset by a decline in fullyinsured membership per member premiums for fullyinsured group accounts increased 50 during 2009 compared to 2008 fullyinsured membership decreased 70 or 139300 members to 1839500 at december 31 2009 compared to 1978800 at december 31 2008 primarily due to the impact of the economic recession which has led to increased ingroup member attrition as employers reduce their workforce levels 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees were 4961 million for 2009 an increase of 442 million or 98 from 4519 million for 2008 primarily due to an increase in per member fees partially offset by a decline in commercial aso membership primarily isolated to the loss of two larger aso accounts 

investment income 

investment income totaled 2963 million for 2009 an increase of 761 million from 2202 million for 2008 primarily reflecting net realized losses in 2008 of 794 million compared to net realized gains of 195 million in 2009 net realized losses in 2008 primarily resulted from otherthantemporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios of 1031 million excluding the change associated with net realized gainslosses investment income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher average invested balances as a result of the reinvestment of operating cash flow 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 2412 million for 2009 an increase of 318 million from 2094 million for 2008 the increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to right sourcerx sm  our mailorder pharmacy 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expense was 248 billion for 2009 an increase of 11 billion or 45 from 237 billion for 2008 the increase primarily was driven by an increase in government segment benefit expense as described below 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2009 was 828 a 170 basis point decrease from 845 for 2008 the decrease primarily was attributable to a decrease in the government segment benefit ratio as described below 

the government segment’s benefit expenses increased 10 billion or 57 during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in the average number of medicare advantage members and the impact from the acquisitions of cariten metcare osf and securehorizons the government segment’s benefit ratio for 2009 

  

was 835 a 240 basis point decrease from 2008 of 859 primarily driven by a 320 basis point decline in the medicare benefit ratio the decline in the medicare benefit ratio primarily resulted from a substantial decline in medicare standalone pdp benefit expenses as a result of our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit designs to correspond with our historical prescription drug claims experience 

the commercial segment’s benefit expenses increased 363 million or 06 during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the osf and cariten acquisitions in the second and fourth quarters of 2008 respectively the benefit ratio for the commercial segment of 806 for 2009 increased 30 basis points from the 2008 benefit ratio of 803 primarily reflecting higher utilization associated with the general economy and the highly competitive environment as well as the impact of the h1n1 virus partially offset by an increase in per member premiums we experienced higher utilization of benefits in our fullyinsured group accounts as ingroup attrition primarily as a result of reductions of less experienced workers has led to a shift in the mix of members to an older workforce having more health care needs as well as members utilizing more benefits ahead of actual or perceived layoffs members seeking to maximize their benefits once their deductibles are met and increased cobra participation 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 2829 million or 72 during 2009 compared to 2008 the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average number of our employees due to the medicare growth and higher average individual product membership the average number of our employees increased 1600 to 28500 for 2009 from 26900 for 2008 or 59 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2009 was 138 increasing 10 basis points from 137 for 2008 primarily due to an increase in the commercial segment sga expense ratio as discussed below the consolidated sga expense ratio is expected to decrease to a range of 130 to 135 for 2010 from efforts to realign our cost structure 

our government and commercial segments incur both direct and shared indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 1370 million or 62 during 2009 compared to 2008 the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 30 basis points from 106 for 2008 to 103 for 2009 the decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership for example during 2009 we transitioned the recently acquired osf and metcare members into our primary medicare service platform and eliminated the cost of having duplicate platforms 

commercial segment sga expenses increased 1459 million or 85 during 2009 compared to 2008 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 170 basis points from 224 for 2008 to 241 for 2009 the increase primarily was due to administrative costs associated with increased business for our mailorder pharmacy and higher average individual product membership average individual product membership increased 176 during 2009 compared to 2008 individual accounts bear a higher sga expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2009 totaled 2503 million compared to 2204 million for 2008 an increase of 299 million or 136 primarily reflecting depreciation expense associated with capital expenditures since december 31 2008 

  

interest expense 

interest expense was 1058 million for 2009 compared to 803 million for 2008 an increase of 255 million primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt in the second quarter of 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement the weighted average effective interest rate for all of our longterm debt was 597 for 2009 and 473 for 2008 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2009 of 351 compared to the effective tax rate of 348 for 2008 the increase was due to a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income substantially offset by the reduction of the 168 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the first quarter of 2009 as a result of audit settlements see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate we expect the 2010 effective tax rate to be approximately 360 

comparison of results of operations for 2008 and 2007 

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

  

    

ending membership was as follows at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

  

 these tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows 

summary 

net income was 6472 million or 383 per diluted common share in 2008 compared to 8337 million or 491 per diluted common share in 2007 the yearoveryear decline primarily reflects lower operating earnings in our government segment as a result of higher expenses associated with our medicare standalone pdp products and lower net investment income primarily due to otherthantemporary impairments in our investment portfolios of 653 million or 039 per diluted common share 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 37 billion or 149 to 281 billion for 2008 compared to 244 billion for 2007 primarily due to higher premium revenues in both the government and commercial segments premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 28 billion or 150 to 210 billion for 2008 compared to 182 billion for 2007 primarily attributable to higher average medicare advantage membership and 

  

an increase in per member premiums partially offset by a decrease in our medicare standalone pdp membership average medicare advantage membership increased 187 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales of our ppo and pffs products drove the majority of the 292900 increase in medicare advantage members since december 31 2007 the cariten osf securehorizons and metcare acquisitions also added 94900 medicare hmo and ppo members medicare advantage per member premiums increased 39 during 2008 compared to 2007 medicare standalone pdp premium revenues decreased 79 during the 2008 period compared to the 2007 period primarily due to a 375400 or 109 decrease in pdp membership since december 31 2007 

commercial segment premium revenues increased 09 billion or 145 to 71 billion for 2008 primarily due to our specialty product offerings including dental vision and other supplemental health and life products as a result of the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007 as well as strategic lineofbusiness organic growth our fullyinsured membership increased 94 or 170200 members to 1978800 at december 31 2008 compared to 1808600 at december 31 2007 excluding 83100 fullyinsured members added with the acquisitions of cariten and osf the increase primarily was due to membership gains in smart products and other consumer offerings individual and small group product lines 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees were 4519 million for 2008 an increase of 604 million or 154 from 3915 million for 2007 primarily due to higher rates a shift in the mix of commercial segment membership towards higher rate groups and the impact from acquisitions 

investment income 

investment income totaled 2202 million for 2008 a decrease of 940 million from 3142 million for 2007 primarily reflecting otherthantemporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios of 1031 million recorded during 2008 of the 1031 million 485 million was allocated to the government segment and 546 million was allocated to the commercial segment excluding these realized losses investment income increased primarily due to higher average invested balances and net realized capital gains partially offset by lower interest rates higher average invested balances primarily resulted from the reinvestment of operating cash flow and the acquired investment portfolio related to the kmg acquisition 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 2094 million for 2008 an increase of 595 million from 1499 million for 2007 the increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to right sourcerx sm  our mailorder pharmacy 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expense was 237 billion for 2008 an increase of 34 billion or 170 from 203 billion for 2007 the increase primarily was driven by an increase in government segment benefit expense 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2008 was 845 a 150 basis point increase from 830 for 2007 the increase primarily was attributable to a higher government segment benefit ratio 

the government segment’s benefit expenses increased 27 billion or 179 during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in the average number of medicare advantage members the government segment’s benefit ratio for 2008 was 859 a 210 basis point increase from 2007 of 838 primarily due to a higher medicare standalone pdp benefit ratio from higher prescription drug utilization and an increase in the percentage of higher cost members in our medicare standalone prescription drug plans 

  

the commercial segment’s benefit expense increased 7094 million or 142 from 2008 to 2007 this increase primarily resulted from the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007 an increase in fullyinsured membership and an increase in average per member claim costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation the benefit ratio for the commercial segment of 803 for 2008 decreased 20 basis points from the 2007 benefit ratio of 805 primarily reflecting an increase in average members in our specialty products from the acquisition of compbenefits in the fourth quarter of 2007 and organic growth in our individual line of business individual and specialty primarily dental and vision accounts generally carry a lower benefit ratio and a higher sga expense ratio compared to larger accounts due to higher distribution costs see related sga expense ratio discussion in the following section 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 4682 million or 135 during 2008 compared to 2007 the increases primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the medicare growth and the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions the number of employees increased by 3900 to 28900 at december 31 2008 from 25000 at december 31 2007 or 156 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2008 was 137 decreasing 20 basis points from 139 for 2007 primarily due to improving administrative cost efficiency associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage and commercial medical membership partially offset by growth in certain of our businesses which carry a higher administrative expense load such as mailorder pharmacy specialty products and individual medical products 

our government and commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 1809 million or 89 during 2008 compared to 2007 the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 112 for 2007 to 106 for 2008 the decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 2873 million or 200 during 2008 compared to 2007 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 90 basis points from 215 for 2007 to 224 for 2008 the increases primarily were due to an increase in specialty business including the acquisition of compbenefits and kmg in the fourth quarter of 2007 together with higher average individual product membership and increased mailorder pharmacy business average individual product membership increased 405 during 2008 compared to 2007 specialty and individual accounts bear a higher sga expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2008 totaled 2204 million compared to 1848 million for 2007 an increase of 356 million or 193 reflecting higher intangible amortization expense due to acquisitions and increased capital expenditures 

interest expense 

interest expense was 803 million for 2008 compared to 689 million for 2007 an increase of 114 million primarily due to higher average outstanding debt partially offset by lower rates 

  

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2008 of 348 compared to the effective tax rate of 353 for 2007 the decrease primarily was due to a lower combined state income tax rate and a greater proportion of taxexempt investment income to total pretax income in 2008 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8— financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums aso fees and investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments sga expenses interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures and repayments on borrowings because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital 

cash and cash equivalents decreased to 16136 million at december 31 2009 from 19704 million at december 31 2008 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash flow from operating activities 

the change in operating cash flows over the three year period primarily results from the corresponding change in earnings our 2008 operating cash flows and earnings were impacted by significantly higher prescription drug claim payments for our medicare standalone pdps as discussed previously 

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and aso fees and payments of benefit expenses we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable 

  

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees the claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the 152 million and 314 million increase in base receivables for 2009 as compared to 2008 and 2008 as compared to 2007 respectively and the 479 million decrease in base receivables for 2007 as compared to 2006 

medicare receivables increased 54 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 and 953 million for 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased 65 million for 2007 as compared to 2006 medicare receivables are impacted by the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

  

   

   the increase in benefits payable in 2009 primarily was due to an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements as well as an increase in ibnr both primarily as a result of medicare advantage membership growth partially offset by a decrease in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff the increase in benefits payable in 2008 and 2007 primarily was due to the increase in ibnr from growth in medicare advantage members and to a lesser extent benefit claims inflation an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff and an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements from medicare advantage membership growth 

in addition to the timing of receipts for premiums and aso fees and payments of benefit expenses other working capital items impacting operating cash flows over the past three years primarily resulted from changes in the timing of collections of pharmacy rebates as well as the medicare part d risk corridor provisions of our contracts with cms 

cash flow from investing activities 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily fixed income securities totaling 19752 million in 2009 6855 million in 2008 and 4301 million in 2007 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 1855 million in 2009 2616 million in 2008 and 2392 million in 2007 increased capital spending in 2008 included expenditures associated with constructing a new data center building and mailorder pharmacy warehouse and capital spending in 2007 included the purchase of three medical centers which were previously leased in south florida excluding acquisitions we expect total capital expenditures in 2010 of approximately 200 million cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 4229 million in 2008 and 4935 million in 2007 primarily related to the securehorizons osf and cariten acquisitions in 2008 and the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions in 2007 

cash flow from financing activities 

in 2009 net borrowings under our credit agreement decreased 2500 million primarily from the repayment of amounts borrowed to fund the acquisition of cariten during 2008 the net repayment of 550 million under our credit agreement primarily related to amounts repaid from the issuance of 750 million in senior notes offset by the 250 million financing of the cariten acquisition net borrowings of 350 million under our credit agreement during 2007 primarily related to the financing of the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions 

in june 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 our net proceeds reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering were 7426 million we used the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement 

  

receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were 4935 million higher than claims payments during 2009 1887 million higher than claim payments during 2008 and 1851 million less than claims payments during 2007 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

in exchange for terminating interestrate swap agreements in 2008 we received cash of 930 million 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2009 2008 and 2007 primarily resulted from the change in the securities lending payable common stock repurchases proceeds from stock option exercises and the excess tax benefit from stock compensation the decrease in securities lending since 2007 resulted from lower margins earned under the program during 2009 there were no repurchases of common shares under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors during 2008 we repurchased 21 million common shares for 928 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 228 million in 2009 133 million in 2008 and 274 million in 2007 

future sources and uses of liquidity 

stock repurchase plan 

on february 22 2008 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 21 million shares in open market transactions for 928 million at an average price of 4419 on july 28 2008 announced august 4 2008 the board of directors increased the authorized amount to 250 million excluding the 928 million used prior to that time in connection with the initial february 2008 authorization no shares were repurchased in 2008 or 2009 under the july 2008 authorization the july authorization was set to expire on december 31 2009 on december 10 2009 announced december 11 2009 the board of directors renewed its 250 million authorization through december 31 2011 under this authorized share repurchase program shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases or in privatelynegotiated transactions subject to certain restrictions on volume pricing and timing we have not yet repurchased any shares under the december 2009 authorization 

senior notes 

during 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 the 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances we also previously issued 300 million of 630 senior notes due august 1 2018 and 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 all four series of our senior notes which are unsecured may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified makewhole amount concurrent with the senior notes issuances we entered into interestrate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor during 2008 we terminated all of our swap agreements we may reenter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

our 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in july 2011 under the credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the 

  

spread currently 50 basis points varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 27 to 80 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 125 basis points may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points depending upon our credit ratings in addition a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50 of the total 10 billion commitment the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option 

the terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse event clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds in addition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of 33879 million at december 31 2009 and a maximum leverage ratio of 301 we are in compliance with the financial covenants with actual net worth of 57760 million and a leverage ratio of 081 as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of december 31 2009 

at december 31 2009 we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement we have outstanding letters of credit of 35 million secured under the credit agreement no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit accordingly as of december 31 2009 we had 9965 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement 

other longterm borrowings 

other longterm borrowings of 375 million at december 31 2009 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in the 2007 kmg acquisition of 361 million and financing for the renovation of a building of 14 million the junior subordinated debt which is due in 2037 may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 802 payable quarterly until 2012 and then payable at a floating rate based on libor plus 310 basis points the debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 200 is collateralized by the building and is payable in various installments through 2014 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and to refinance or repay debt see the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2009 was bbb according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points or annual interest expense by 19 million up to a maximum 100 basis points or annual interest expense by 75 million 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry the parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company increased 4151 million to 6656 million at december 31 2009 compared to 2505 million at december 31 2008 we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries during 2009 our subsidiaries paid dividends of 7741 million to the parent compared to 2960 million in 2008 and 3770 million in 2007 in addition the parent made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of 1323 million in 2009 compared to 2428 million in 2008 and 3073 million in 2007 

  

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc the parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level based on the statutory financial statements as of december 31 2009 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 36 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries 12 billion above the aggregate 24 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2009 as follows 

 

  

      

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2009 we are not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

related parties 

no related party transactions had a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 20 2010—see “certain transactions with management and others” 

government contracts 

our medicare business which accounted for approximately 62 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily consisted of products covered under the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan contracts with the federal government these contracts are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the calendar year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare business have been renewed for 2010 

cms is continuing to perform audits of selected medicare advantage plans of various companies to validate the provider coding practices and resulting economics under the actuarial riskadjustment model used to calculate the individual member capitation paid to medicare advantage plans several humana contracts have been selected by cms for audit and we expect that cms will continue conducting audits for the 2007 contract year and beyond 

we generally rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including riskadjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions which we generally send to cms as the basis for our payment received from cms under the actuarial riskadjustment model the cms audits involve a review of a sample of provider medical records for the contracts being audited rates paid to medicare advantage plans are established under a bid model the actuarial process whereby our premium is based on a comparison of our beneficiaries’ risk scores derived from medical diagnoses to those enrolled in the government’s original medicare program as a result we believe that an actuarially sound adjustment of payments from these audits would need to take into account the level of coding accuracy and provider medical 

  

record documentation completeness under the government’s original medicare program since the risk adjustment system bids benefit structures and payment rates were premised on that data this would help to ensure that the audit methodology applied to medicare advantage plans accurately calculates the economic impact of the audit findings additionally our payment received from cms as well as benefits offered and premiums charged to members is based on bids that did not by cms design include any assumption of retroactive audit payment adjustments we believe that applying a retroactive audit adjustment after cms acceptance of bids would improperly alter this process of establishing member benefits and premiums 

cms has not formally announced its audit payment adjustment methodology nor has cms formally indicated whether the audit payment adjustment methodology will be based on a comparison to original medicare coding accuracy cms has further indicated that it may make retroactive contractlevel payment adjustments any such payment adjustments could occur as early as 2010 and could be effected prior to our or other medicare advantage plans having the opportunity to appeal audit findings or the underlying payment adjustment methodology we continue to work with cms and our industry group to submit comments to cms regarding its proposed audit and appeals process which cms has published in a proposed rule and has referenced in informal guidance documents we are unable to estimate the financial impact of any audits that may be conducted related to 2007 revenue and beyond or whether any findings would cause a change to our method of estimating future premium revenue in bid submissions made to cms for future contract years or compromise premium rate assumptions made in our bids for prior contract years at this time we do not know whether cms will require payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to original medicare coding and using its method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract however if cms requires payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology without comparison to original medicare coding and using a method of extrapolating findings to the entire contract and if we are unable to obtain any relief preventing the payment adjustments from being implemented we believe that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 2 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 consists of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico our medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration or prhia for the east and southeast regions were extended through december 31 2009 with no change in terms the prhia has confirmed its intention to extend the current contracts until june 30 2010 with no changes in terms and is in the process of executing such extensions 

the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our military services business which accounted for approximately 12 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily consists of the tricare south region contract the original 5year south region contract expired march 31 2009 through an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract an additional oneyear option period the sixth option period which runs from april 1 2009 through march 31 2010 was exercised by the government the amendment also provides for two additional sixmonth option periods the seventh option period runs from april 1 2010 through september 30 2010 and the eighth option period runs from october 1 2010 through march 31 2011 exercise of each of the seventh and eighth option periods is at the government’s option on december 16 2009 we were notified by tma that it intends to exercise its options to extend the tricare south region contract for option period vii and option period viii the exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the tricare south region contract through march 31 2011 the contract’s transition provisions require the continuation of certain activities primarily claims processing during a winddown period lasting approximately six months following the expiration date claims incurred on or prior to the expiration date would continue to be processed during the winddown period under the terms existing prior to the expiration date 

  

as required under the current contract the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for each option period are negotiated any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount may have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in july 2009 we were notified by the department of defense that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the gao in connection with the award to another contractor citing discrepancies between the award criteria and procedures prescribed in the request for proposals issued by the dod and those that appear to have been used by the dod in making its contractor selection in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest at this time we are not able to determine what actions tma will take in response to recommendations by the gao nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefit expense recognition 

benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 

 

   

military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data this amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government as more fullydescribed on page 48 

estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results of operations and overall financial position accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” as such we expect that substantially all of the december 31 2009 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2010 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing changes in medical management processes product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including receipt cycle times claim inventory levels recoveries of overpayments outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years for example the average receipt cycle time has decreased from 156 days in 2007 to 140 days in 2009 which represents a 103 reduction in cycle time over the three year period if claims are submitted or processed on a faster slower pace than prior periods the actual claim may be more less complete than originally estimated using our completion factors which may result in reserves that are higher lower than required 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these 

  

expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2009 data 

 

  

   the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 

 

   

the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefit expenses ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 

 

  

 as summarized in the table above the majority of the favorable development resulted from trend factors for the most recent three months ultimately being lower than originally estimated for each of the years presented some of the more significant factors that drove the actual trend factors lower than the originally estimated trends over the last three years include lower than originally estimated utilization of hospital and physician services for both our commercial and medicare lines of business as well as rapid growth in our medicare advantage and commercial high deductible products in new geographic areas which resulted in more limited historical information from which to base trend rate estimates 

additionally actual completion factors ultimately were higher than our original completion factors used to establish reserves at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 which were based upon historical patterns this increase in completion factor percentage primarily resulted from a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions and improved claim recovery patterns associated with system and process changes 

finally firstyear medicare part d enrollment and eligibility issues during 2006 led to actual claim settlements with other health plans and various state governments during 2007 for amounts less than originally estimated similar adjustments in 2009 and 2008 were not significant due to a lower volume of new enrollees and subsequent improvements in the program’s enrollment process 

we continually adjust our historical trend and completion factor experience with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves because our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions as required by actuarial standards there is a reasonable possibility that variances between actual trend and completion factors and those assumed in our december 31 2009 estimates would fall towards the middle of the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity table as has occurred in previous years 

benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

   

our tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk of financing health benefits the federal government both reimburses us for our cost of providing health benefits and bears responsibility for 80 of any variance from the annual target health care cost and actual health care cost as more fully described beginning on page 61 therefore the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for tricare benefits payable is reduced substantially by corresponding adjustments to revenues the net decrease to income from operations as determined retrospectively after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period was approximately 78 million for 2008 and 137 million for 2007 the impact from changes in estimates for 2009 is not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2010 will change as our december 31 2009 benefits payable estimate develops throughout 2010 

future policy benefits payable of 11930 million and 11648 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including longterm care health and life insurance policies and annuities sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 5719 million at december 31 2009 and 5032 million at december 31 2008 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold we filed and received approval for certain state premium rate increases in 2009 and continue to expect to file for premium rate increases for additional states in 2010 to the extent premium rate increases andor loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required in addition future policy benefits payable include amounts of 2250 million at december 31 2009 and 2320 million at december 31 2008 which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant the amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has been impacted by the growth in our medicare business coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices when we recognize a release of the redundancy we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business if material we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

  

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and members in our medicare and individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified payment rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from cms for our medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare part d provisions 

we cover prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d under multiple contracts with cms the payments we receive monthly from cms and members which are determined from our annual bid represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage we recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract our cms payment is subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions in addition we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk as described more fully below 

the risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period accordingly this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience we record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or longterm in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement 

the estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms in 2009 we received net proceeds of 596 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2008 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 554 million at december 31 2008 in 2008 we paid 787 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2007 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 1026 million at december 31 2007 the net liability associated with the 2009 risk corridor estimate which will be settled in 2010 was 1446 million at december 31 2009 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent funding from cms for its portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent funding from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and related settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year we account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize premium revenues or benefit expense for these subsidies receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts 

  

payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period gross financing receipts were 23542 million and gross financing withdrawals were 18607 million during 2009 cms subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2009 was 117 million to other current assets and 4029 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 

in order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage cms provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage or coverage beyond cms’s defined standard benefits the demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which cms pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government’s portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage the capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer we chose the demonstration payment option for some of our plans that offer enhanced coverage over the last three years and in 2010 this capitation amount derived from our annual bid submissions is recorded as premium revenue the variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program 

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms has implemented a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity the cms riskadjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs as described in item 1—business beginning on page 5 under this riskadjustment methodology diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us we generally rely on providers to appropriately document all medical data including riskadjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions which we generally send to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate riskadjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms 

military services 

in 2009 military services revenues represented approximately 12 of total premiums and administrative services fees military services revenue primarily is derived from our tricare south region contract with the department of defense the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities we allocate the consideration to the various components of the contract based on the relative fair value of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative services fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment disease management and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

the tricare south region contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target health care cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance of actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 

  

to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses we continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

the military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 74972 million or 53 of total assets at december 31 2009 and 52154 million or 40 of total assets at december 31 2008 debt securities detailed below comprised this entire investment portfolio at december 31 2009 and over 99 of this investment portfolio at december 31 2008 the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 approximately 99 of our debt securities were investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2009 most of the debt securities that are below investmentgrade are rated bb or better the higher end of the below investmentgrade rating scale our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

tax exempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 3469 million at december 31 2009 and 6948 million at december 31 2008 these prerefunded bonds are secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations aaa by sp at the time the fund is established in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our tax exempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 5872 million and 4524 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively of tax exempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa 

  

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was 55 million at december 31 2009 and 76 million at december 31 2008 there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio 

the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 373 at december 31 2009 and 417 at december 31 2008 

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 45 years at december 31 2009 including cash equivalents the average duration was approximately 38 years based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 340 million 

gross unrealized losses and fair values aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

 in april 2009 the financial accounting standards board or the fasb issued new guidance to address concerns about 1 measuring the fair value of financial instruments when the markets become inactive and quoted prices may reflect distressed transactions and 2 recording impairment charges on investments in debt securities the new guidance highlights and expands on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for a financial asset or liability has significantly decreased and requires new disclosures relating to fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques including changes in inputs and valuation techniques in addition new guidance regarding recognition and presentation of otherthantemporary impairments changed 1 the trigger for determining whether an otherthantemporary impairment exists and 2 the amount of an impairment charge to be recorded in earnings we adopted the provisions of the new guidance for the quarter ended june 30 2009 refer to note 4 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for disclosures related to the implementation of the new guidance 

  

under the new otherthantemporary impairment model for debt securities held we recognize an impairment loss in income in an amount equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value when we have the intent to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of our amortized cost basis however if we do not intend to sell the debt security we evaluate the expected cash flows to be received as compared to amortized cost and determine if a credit loss has occurred in the event of a credit loss only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized currently in income with the remainder of the loss recognized in other comprehensive income 

when we do not intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position potential otti is considered using a variety of factors including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost adverse conditions specifically related to the industry geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security payment structure of the security changes in credit rating of the security by the rating agencies the volatility of the fair value changes and changes in fair value of the security after the balance sheet date for debt securities we take into account expectations of relevant market and economic data for example with respect to mortgage and assetbacked securities such data includes underlying loan level data and structural features such as seniority and other forms of credit enhancements a decline in fair value is considered otherthantemporary when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we estimate the amount of the credit loss component of a debt security as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows of the security the present value is determined using the best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the implicit interest rate at the date of purchase the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

approximately 196 million of our unrealized losses at december 31 2009 relate to our residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities factors such as seniority underlying collateral characteristics and credit enhancements support the recoverability of these securities residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities are primarily composed of senior tranches having high credit support with 99 of the collateral consisting of prime loans all commercial mortgagebacked securities are rated aaa at december 31 2009 

all issuers of securities we own trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments after taking into account these and other factors previously described we believe these unrealized losses primarily were caused by an increase in market interest rates and tighter liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased as of december 31 2009 we do not intend to sell the securities with an unrealized loss position in accumulated other comprehensive income and it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis and as a result we believe that the securities with an unrealized loss are not otherthantemporarily impaired as of december 31 2009 

there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2009 or 2007 gross realized losses in 2008 included otherthantemporary impairments of 1031 million primarily due to investments in lehman brothers holdings inc and certain of its subsidiaries which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008 as well as declines in the values of securities primarily associated with the financial services industry 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2009 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 21 of total assets and 50 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 23 and 67 respectively at december 31 2008 

  

we are required to test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable commercial and government segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital and terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and administrative cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual including the impact of the ultimate outcome of health care reform legislation if any the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a margin ranging from approximately 33 to 83 a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease this margin to a range of approximately 15 to 63 

the ultimate loss of the tricare south region contract would adversely affect 498 million of the military services reporting unit’s goodwill in july 2009 we were notified by the dod that we were not awarded the third generation tricare program contract for the south region which had been subject to competing bids we filed a protest with the gao in connection with the award to another contractor and in october 2009 we learned that the gao had upheld our protest determining that the tma evaluation of our proposal had unreasonably failed to fully recognize and reasonably account for the likely cost savings associated with our record of obtaining network provider discounts from our established network in the south region on december 22 2009 we were advised that tma notified the gao of its intent to implement corrective action consistent with the discussion contained within the gao’s decision with respect to our protest at this time we are not able to determine what actions tma will take in response to recommendations by the gao nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate disposition of the contract award 

our current tricare south region contract covers benefits for healthcare services provided to beneficiaries through march 31 2010 on december 16 2009 we were notified by tma that it intends to exercise its options to extend the tricare south region contract for option period vii and option period viii the exercise of these option periods would effectively extend the tricare south region contract through march 31 2011 we will continue to assess the fair value of our military services reporting unit each reporting period based on our estimate of future discounted cash flows associated with the reporting unit primarily derived from cash flows associated with the tricare south region contract we will recognize a goodwill impairment if and when our impairment test indicates that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we expect that as the ultimate march 31 2011 contract end date nears if our current contract is not extended further and we are not awarded the new third generation tricare program contract for the south region future cash flows will not be sufficient to warrant recoverability of all or a portion of the tricare goodwill given these facts we would expect a goodwill impairment during the second half of 2010 refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of the tricare south region contract 

  

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no impairment losses in the last three years longlived assets associated with our military services business are not material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings and financial position are exposed to financial market risk including those resulting from changes in interest rates 

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense until october 7 2008 we exchanged the fixed interest rate under all of our senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor using interest rate swap agreements as a result changes in interest rates generally resulted in an increase or decrease to investment income partially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase to interest expense partially hedging our exposure to interest rate risk however due to extreme volatility in the securities and credit markets libor increased while the interest rate we would earn on invested assets like cash and cash equivalents decreased as a result we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements fixing the average interest rate under our senior notes at 608 in exchange for terminating our rights under the interest rate swap agreements we received 930 million in cash from the counterparties representing the fair value of the swap assets we may reenter into interest rate swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors amounts borrowed under the revolving credit portion of our 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement bear interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at december 31 2009 and 2500 million in borrowings outstanding at december 31 2008 

interest rate risk also represents a market risk factor affecting our consolidated financial position due to our significant investment portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity securities of investmentgrade quality with an average sp credit rating of aa at december 31 2009 our net unrealized position improved 3013 million from a net unrealized loss position of 2299 million at december 31 2008 to a net unrealized gain position of 714 million at december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 we had gross unrealized losses of 784 million on our investment portfolio primarily due to an increase in market interest rates and tighter 

  

liquidity conditions in the current markets than when the securities were purchased and as such there were no material otherthantemporary impairments during 2009 while we believe that these impairments are temporary and we currently do not have the intent to sell such securities given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

duration is the timeweighted average of the present value of the bond portfolio’s cash flow duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in fair value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our fixed maturity securities to changes in interest rates however actual fair values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was approximately 38 years as of december 31 2009 based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 340 million 

we have also evaluated the impact on our investment income and interest expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our outstanding indebtedness as of december 31 2009 and 2008 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including unexpected changes of cash flows into and out of the portfolio changes in the asset allocation including shifts between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points four times and have changed by less than 100 basis points four times

 item 1 business tableend general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc and its subsidiaries referred to throughout this document as “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “humana” is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies based on our 2008 revenues of 289 billion we are a fullservice benefits solutions company offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups government benefit programs and individuals as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 116 million members enrolled in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 68 million members enrolled in our specialty products during 2008 72 of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government including 16 related to our contracts in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms and 12 related to our military services contracts under our cms contracts in florida we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 492700 members as of december 31 2008 

humana inc was organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 and our website address is wwwhumanacom we have made available free of charge through the investor relations section of our web site our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k proxy statements and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the sec 

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a—risk factors for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results or business 

business segments 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals we identified our segments in accordance with the 

  

aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas 131  which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

our products 

as more fully described in the products discussion that follows we provide health insurance benefits under health maintenance organization or hmo private feeforservice or pffs and preferred provider organization or ppo plans in addition we provide other benefits with our specialty products including dental vision and other supplementary benefits the following table presents our segment membership at december 31 2008 and premiums and administrative services only or aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2008 

 

   

our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries 

medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 20 years since recent significant changes were made to the medicare program for health plans like those offered by us we have expanded from a regional to a national presence now offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states the resulting growing membership base provides us with greater leverage to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and programs such as personal nurse ®  which is a case management and disease management program and a fitness program for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care including cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes that result in living healthier 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance prescription drug benefits are provided under part d cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program 

medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month we refer to beneficiaries enrolled in these plans collectively as medicare advantage or mapd members with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of traditional medicare typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data analysis techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions disease management programs wellness and prevention programs and in some instances a reduced monthly part b premium since 2006 medicare beneficiaries have had more health plan options including a prescription drug benefit option and greater access to a ppo offering with the rollout of regional ppo plans prior to 2006 ppo plans were offered on a local basis only most medicare advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in most cases these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

our medicare pffs plans have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at reimbursement rates equivalent to traditional medicare payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s riskadjustment model which uses health status 

  

indicators or risk scores to improve the adequacy of payment the riskadjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms transitioned to this riskbased reimbursement model while the old reimbursement model based on demographic data including gender age and disability status was phased out the phasein of risk adjusted payment was completed in 2007 under the riskadjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must capture collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

commensurate with the phasein of the riskadjustment methodology payments to medicare advantage plans were increased by a “budget neutrality” factor the budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced during the transition from the previous reimbursement model based upon average original medicare feeforservice spending to the riskadjustment payment model the budget neutrality adjustment began phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by 2011 

at december 31 2008 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 1435900 mapd members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 138 billion or 483 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2008 under our medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 365700 members these contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately 45 billion which represented approximately 326 of our medicare advantage premium revenues or 157 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2008 

our hmo pffs and ppo products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage business have been renewed for 2009 

medicare standalone prescription drug products 

on january 1 2006 we began offering standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our three plan choices between november 15 and december 31 for coverage that begins january 1 our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described beginning on page 58 our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp business have been renewed for 2009 

medicaid product 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a statespecific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders 

  

before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 2 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2008 consisted of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico we also added approximately 85700 medicaid members with the october 2008 acquisition of php companies inc or cariten under a contract in tennessee which expired on december 31 2008 and was not renewed 

military services 

under our tricare south region contract with the united states department of defense we provide health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in a hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers similar to a ppo 

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 30 million eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2008 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense of these eligible beneficiaries 12 million were tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries seniors over the age of 65 and beneficiaries in puerto rico for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract the 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2009 was subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year at the government’s option on january 16 2009 we entered into an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract the amendment added one additional oneyear option period the sixth option period which runs from april 1 2009 through march 31 2010 and two additional sixmonth option periods the seventh option period runs from april 1 2010 through september 30 2010 and the eighth option period runs from october 1 2010 through march 31 2011 exercise of each of the sixth seventh and eighth option periods is at the government’s option under these extensions government requirements terms and conditions will remain the same as the current contract on january 22 2009 we were notified by the government of its intent to exercise its option to extend the tricare contract for the sixth option period 

on march 24 2008 the department of defense issued its formal request for proposal for new contracts for tricare medical benefits nationwide we submitted our bid in june 2008 and after discussions with the department of defense submitted our final proposal revisions in january 2009 

the tricare south region contract contains provisions that require us to negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments 

we participate in a demonstration project known as project hero healthcare effectiveness through resource optimization under a contract with the department of veterans affairs or va to support healthcare delivery to veterans under this contract we arrange health care for veterans not otherwise available within the 

  

va health care delivery system through our network of providers we are compensated by the va for the cost of our providers’ services at a specified contractual amount per service plus an additional administrative fee for each transaction the contract under which we began providing services on january 1 2008 is comprised of one base period and four oneyear option periods subject to renewals at the federal government’s option we are currently in the first option period which expires on september 30 2009 for the year ended december 31 2008 revenues under this va contract were approximately 227 million or less than 1 of our total premium and aso fees 

for the year ended december 31 2008 military services premium revenues were approximately 32 billion or 113 of our total premiums and aso fees and military services aso fees totaled 768 million or 03 of our total premiums and aso fees 

international and green ribbon health operations 

in august 2006 we established our subsidiary humana europe in the united kingdom to provide commissioning support to primary care trusts or pcts in england under the contracts we are awarded we work in partnership with local pcts health care providers and patients to strengthen healthservice delivery and to implement strategies at a local level to help the national health service enhance patient experience improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs for the year ended december 31 2008 revenues under these contracts were approximately 77 million or less than 1 of our total premium and aso fees 

we participated in a medicare health support pilot program through green ribbon health or grh a jointventure company with pfizer health solutions inc grh was designed to support cms assigned medicare beneficiaries living with diabetes andor congestive heart failure in central florida grh used disease management initiatives including evidencebased clinical guidelines personal selfdirected change strategies and personal nurses to help participants navigate the health system revenues under the contract with cms over the period which began november 1 2005 and ended august 15 2008 are subject to refund unless savings satisfaction and clinical improvement targets are met under the terms of the contract after a claims runout period cms is required to deliver a performance report during the third quarter of 2009 to date all revenues have been deferred until reliable estimates are determinable and revenues are not expected to be material when recognized 

our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members 

smart plans and other consumer products 

over the last several years we have developed and offered various commercial products designed to provide options and choices to employers that are annually facing substantial premium increases driven by doubledigit medical cost inflation these smart plans discussed more fully below and other consumer offerings which can be offered on either a fullyinsured or aso basis provided coverage to approximately 670000 members at december 31 2008 representing approximately 185 of our total commercial medical membership as detailed below 

 

 these products are often offered to employer groups as “bundles” where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the employer 

  

paramount to our product strategy we have developed a group of innovative consumer products styled as “smart” products that we believe will be a longterm solution for employers we believe this new generation of products provides more 1 choices for the individual consumer 2 transparency of provider costs and 3 benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions including the tradeoffs between higher premiums and pointofservice costs at the time consumers choose their plans and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans we believe that when consumers can make informed choices about the cost and effectiveness of their health care a sustainable long term solution for employers can be realized smart products which accounted for approximately 45 of enrollment in all of our consumer plans as of december 31 2008 are only sold to employers who use humana as their sole health insurance carrier 

some employers have selected other types of consumer products such as 1 a product with a high deductible 2 a catastrophic coverage plan or 3 products that offer a spending account option in conjunction with more traditional medical coverage or as a standalone plan unlike our smart products these products while valuable in helping employers deal with nearterm cost increases by shifting costs to employees are not considered by us to be longterm comprehensive solutions to the employers’ cost dilemma although we view them as an important interim step 

hmo 

our commercial hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include among others hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan 

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers together with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician we participate in the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp primarily with our hmo offering in certain markets fehbp is the government’s health insurance program for federal employees retirees former employees family members and spouses for the year ended december 31 2008 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 26 billion or 91 of our total premiums and aso fees 

ppo 

our commercial ppo products which are marketed primarily to employer groups and individuals include some types of wellness and utilization management programs however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees 

as part of our ppo products we offer humanaone a major medical product marketed directly to individuals we offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels this individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses 

  

for the year ended december 31 2008 employer and individual commercial ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 36 billion or 126 of our total premiums and aso fees

in addition to fullyinsured smart plans and other consumer offerings hmo and ppo products we also offer aso products to employers who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fullyinsured ppo hmo or smart plans and other consumer products described previously under aso contracts selffunded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits however most aso customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs for the year ended december 31 2008 commercial aso fees totaled 3510 million or 12 of our total premiums and aso fees 

specialty 

we also offer various specialty products including dental vision and other supplemental products as well as disease management services under corphealth inc dba lifesynch and mailorder pharmacy benefit administration services for our members under right sourcerx sm  during 2007 we made investments which significantly expanded our specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of compbenefits corporation and kmg america corporation these acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings including vision and other supplemental health and life products primarily sold on a voluntary basis the supplemental health plans cover for example some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness other supplemental health products also include a closed block of approximately 37000 longterm care policies acquired in connection with the kmg acquisition no new policies have been written since 2005 under this closed block at december 31 2008 we had approximately 68 million specialty members including 36 million dental members and 22 million vision members for the year ended december 31 2008 specialty product premiums and aso fees were approximately 9422 million or 33 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2008 by market and product 

 

  

 provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs the 

  

focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met our hospitalist programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of its intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

capitation 

for approximately 23 of our medical membership at december 31 2008 we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefit ratio the benefit ratio measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

for approximately 47 of our medical membership at december 31 2008 we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for services rendered we share hospital and other benefit expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

 capitation expense as a percentage of total benefit expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

   

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate hmos based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or jcaho 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commission also known as the utilization review accreditation commission or urac urac performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo accreditation specific to the utilization review process also is required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in all of our commercial hmo markets except puerto rico and in select ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our medicare medicaid and commercial products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2008 we employed approximately 1800 sales representatives as well as approximately 800 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with state farm ® and united services automobile association or usaa commissions paid to employed sales representatives and independent brokers and agents are based on a per unit commission structure approved by cms 

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an 

  

employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we also offer commercial health insurance and specialty products directly to individuals 

at december 31 2008 we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 1200 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

underwriting 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described in the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

government regulation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels continue to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

for a complete description of all of the current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

  

other 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 28900 employees including 34 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate our profitability could be materially adversely affected 

we use a substantial portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however these estimates involve extensive judgment and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to payment patterns and medical cost trends many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we also estimate costs associated with longduration insurance policies including life insurance annuities health and longterm care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these future policy benefit reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 5032 million at december 31 2008 associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block 

  

of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold we expect to file premium rate increases in 2009 to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required 

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively our membership and profitability could be materially adversely affected 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program as well as in smart plans and other consumer health plans such as high deductible health plans with health savings accounts hsas we believe that barriers to entry in our markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationship with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract including our tricare contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our business could be materially adversely affected 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the medicare modernization act of 2003 or mma the mma offers opportunities in our medicare programs including our hmo and ppo as well as our standalone pdp products we have made substantial investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these programs the expansion of our provider networks and our success in attracting increasing numbers of pffs members to our networkbased products positions us well for changes in the medicare program that will effectively eliminate the pffs plan option in 2011 although there can be no assurances that our pffs members will choose to move to our networkbased products over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach since the enactment of the mma through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia 

  

the growth of our medicare business is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the medicare business these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business with emphasis on our aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including our smart plans and other consumer offerings such as hsas and our specialty products such as dental vision and other supplemental products as well as the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents and other stakeholders through webenabling technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

  

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions securities laws claims and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

  

see “legal proceedings” in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs our government segment accounted for approximately 74 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2008 these programs involve various risks as described further below 

 

  

 on march 24 2008 the department of defense issued its formal request for proposal for new contracts for tricare medical benefits nationwide we submitted our bid in june 2008 and after discussions with the department of defense submitted our final proposal revisions in january 2009 if we are not awarded a new tricare contract it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

 in august 2008 we renewed our contracts with the puerto rico insurance administration for the east and southeast regions these contracts expire on june 30 2009 the loss of these contracts or 

  

significant changes in the puerto rico medicaid program as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we also provided services under a threeyear aso contract with the puerto rico health administration for the metro north region the puerto rico health administration did not renew the third year of the aso contract and the contract expired on september 30 2008 the loss of this contract did not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

  

 cms has announced that it will perform audits of selected medicare advantage plans each year to validate the provider coding practices under the riskadjustment model used to reimburse medicare advantage plans these audits will involve a comprehensive review of medical records and may result in contractlevel payment adjustments to premium payments made to a health plan pursuant to its medicare contract with cms or other payment reductions the first data validation audits will focus on riskadjustment data for 2006 used to determine 2007 payment amounts 

several humana contracts are included in audits being undertaken by cms if necessary based on audit results cms may make contractlevel payment adjustments that may occur during 2009 and adjustments may occur prior to humana or other medicare advantage plans having the opportunity to appeal audit findings we primarily rely on providers to appropriately document riskadjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions which we send to cms as the basis for our riskadjustment model premium we are working with cms and our industry group to develop an orderly audit process for which cms has not yet indicated the complete details therefore we are unable to predict the complete audit methodology to be used by cms the outcome of these audits or whether these audits would result in a payment adjustment however it is reasonably possible that a payment adjustment as a result of these audits could occur and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

 

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms beginning in 2008 the risk corridor thresholds increased which means we bear more risk our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net receivable of 554 million at december 31 2008 

  

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including but not limited to discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or reimbursement as a lowincome or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

other risks could include 

 

  

  

  

 our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative change could increase our costs of doing business and could materially adversely affect our profitability 

the health care industry in general and health insurance particularly hmos and ppos are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

the enactment of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 or the act in july 2008 could affect our medicare operations principally beginning in 2011 sponsors of medicare advantage pffs plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans additionally the act prohibits several different kinds of marketing activities by medicare plan sponsors and their brokers beginning in 2009 and will phase out indirect medical education ime costs beginning in 2010 we are implementing various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by the act in addition most of our pffs enrollees reside in geographies where we have developed a ppo network and offer a ppo plan we will continue to develop our ppo network and build networkbased plan offerings to address the network restriction nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level based on the statutory financial statements as of december 31 2008 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 35 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries 14 billion above the aggregate 21 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa can also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates a business associate is a person or entity other than a member of the work force who on behalf of a covered entity performs or assists in the performance of a function or activity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information or provides legal accounting consulting data aggregation management administrative accreditation or financial services 

laws in each of the states including puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including the scope of benefits rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations 

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance our hmos are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health audits and investigations are also conducted by state attorneys general cms the office of the inspector general of health and human services the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor and the defense contract audit agency all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs or the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

other areas subject to substantial regulation include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 two areas of legislation that can impact the company are experiencing continued activity these are medicare funding under mma and proposals to expand health insurance coverage mma funding and associated program structure is an area of substantial legislative attention that may be influenced by federal budget considerations and medicare spending trends the federal and state efforts to expand access to health coverage may offer opportunities to serve individuals who are not currently in the health insurance market through public program expansions coverage connectors or premium assistance programs current state fiscal conditions may affect the scope and scale of proposals some access proposals also include increased regulation of our commercial business particularly small group and individual through a combination of benefit mandates underwriting restrictions rating limitations and assessments 

state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 all of these proposals could apply to us and could result in new regulations that increase the cost of our operations 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on us delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect entry into new markets our revenues or the number of our members increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 

we are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products 

while it is not possible to predict when and whether fundamental policy changes would occur these could include policy changes on the local state and federal level that could fundamentally change the dynamics of our industry such as a larger role of the government in the health care arena changes in public policy could materially affect our profitability and cash flow our ability to retain or grow our business and our financial position 

any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability while we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses increases in staffrelated expenses investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products acquisitions and implementation of regulatory requirements among others may occur from time to time 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously in 2008 we acquired unitedhealth group’s las vegas nevada individual securehorizons medicare advantage hmo business osf health plans inc metcare health plans inc and php companies inc dba cariten healthcare and in late 2007 we acquired kmg america corporation and compbenefits corporation the failure to successfully integrate these entities and businesses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may also be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

  

our mailorder pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects us to regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

our mailorder pharmacy business opened in 2006 competes with locally owned drugstores retail drugstore chains supermarkets discount retailers membership clubs internet companies as well as other mailorder and longterm care pharmacies it also subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailservices pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such 

historically rating agencies take action to lower ratings due to among other things perceived concerns about liquidity or solvency the competitive environment in the insurance industry the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies in addition rating agencies have come under recent regulatory and public scrutiny over the ratings assigned to various fixedincome products as a result rating agencies may i become more conservative in their methodology and criteria ii increase the frequency or scope of their credit reviews iii request additional information from the companies that they rate or iv adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 

we believe that some of our customers place importance on our credit ratings and we may lose customers and compete less successfully if our ratings were to be downgraded in addition our credit ratings affect our ability to obtain investment capital on favorable terms if our credit ratings were to be lowered our cost of borrowing likely would increase our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

the current recession and overall state of the us economy could adversely affect our employer group and individual business including medicare renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums the state of the us economy could also adversely affect the budget of individual states and of the federal government that could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military services and medicaid programs and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in addition general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care increasing the costs of paying claims 

we are also subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and nongovernmental selfregulatory agencies including but not limited to foreign regulators state insurance regulators the us securities and exchange commission the new york stock exchange the us department of justice and state attorneys general in light of the difficult economic conditions some of these authorities are considering or may in the future consider enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or to otherwise assure the stability of institutions under their supervision these authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory or enforcement authority in new or more robust ways all of these possibilities if they occurred could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital either of which in turn could have a material adverse effect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the securities and credit markets recently have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption 

the volatility and disruption in the securities and credit markets has impacted our investment portfolio we evaluate our investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis this review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment for the purpose of determining gross realized gains and losses the cost of investment securities is based upon specific identification in analyzing individual securities for otherthantemporary impairments we consider factors affecting the issuer factors affecting the industry within which the issuer operates and general debt and equity market trends we also consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below its carrying value the severity of the decline the nearterm prospects for recovery to cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized during 2008 we realized losses associated with otherthantemporary impairments of 1031 million gross unrealized losses were 3130 million and gross unrealized gains were 832 million at december 31 2008 

given current market conditions there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements however continuing adverse securities and credit market conditions could significantly affect the availability of credit while there is no assurance in the current economic environment we have no reason to believe the lenders participating in our credit agreement will not be willing and able to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the agreement 

our access to additional credit will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit both to the overall market and our industry our credit ratings and debt capacity as well as 

  

the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or shortterm financial prospects similarly our access to funds could be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies were to take negative actions against us if a combination of these factors were to occur we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 

given the current economic climate our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility 

recently the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility companyspecific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have caused this volatility our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these factors could materially reduce our stock price in addition broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies based on our 2008 revenues of 289 billion we are a fullservice benefits solutions company offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit products for employer groups government benefit programs and individuals as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 116 million members enrolled in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 68 million members enrolled in our specialty products 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of sfas 131  which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same provider networks in some instances enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

our results are impacted by many factors but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium aso fee and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures new prescription drugs and therapies an aging population lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking the tort liability system and government regulation 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefit ratio which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the selling general and administrative expense ratio or sga expense ratio which is computed by taking total selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues administrative services fees and other revenues represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

government segment 

our strategy and commitment to the medicare programs has led to significant growth over the last three years medicare advantage membership increased to 1435900 members at december 31 2008 up 292900 members or 256 from 1143000 members at december 31 2007 primarily due to sales of preferred provider organization or ppo and private feeforservice pffs products the acquisitions of php companies inc dba cariten healthcare or cariten osf health plans inc or osf securehorizons and metcare health plans inc or metcare also added 94900 medicare hmo and ppo members likewise medicare advantage premium revenues have increased 233 to 138 billion for 2008 from 112 billion for 2007 in addition recently the mix of sales has shifted increasingly to our networkbased ppo offerings we expect medicare advantage membership to increase by 25000 to 75000 members in 2009 nearly 60 of our january 2009 medicare advantage members are enrolled in networkbased products our ppo membership increased 57 from december 2008 to january 2009 including the voluntary move of 65000 of our pffs members 

  

we offer three medicare standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under the medicare part d program our standard enhanced and complete products these plans provide varying degrees of coverage in order to offer these plans in a given year in june of the preceding year we must submit bids to cms for approval during 2008 we experienced prescription drug claim expenses for our medicare standalone pdps that were higher than we had originally assumed in the bid that we submitted to cms in june 2007 these higher claim levels for our medicare standalone pdps reflected a combination of several variances between our actuarial bid assumptions versus our experience these variances resulted from among other things differences between the actuarial utilization assumptions which are our attempts to predict members’ future utilization of drugs in the bids for our enhanced plans versus our actual claims experience in 2008 as well as an increase in the percentage of higher cost members in both our standard and enhanced plans the lower standalone pdp operating results primarily caused the decrease in consolidated earnings during 2008 compared to 2007 we believe we have addressed these issues for 2009 based on enhancements made to our bid development and review processes in january 2009 standalone pdp membership declined by 924000 members to approximately 2143000 resulting primarily from our competitive positioning as we realigned standalone pdp premium and benefit structures to correspond with our pharmacy claims experience 

the enactment of the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 or the act in july 2008 could affect our medicare operations principally beginning in 2011 sponsors of medicare advantage pffs plans will be required to contract with providers to establish adequate networks except in geographic areas that cms determines have fewer than two networkbased medicare advantage plans nearly 60 of our medicare advantage members are already enrolled in one of our networkbased plans as of january 31 2009 we are implementing various operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to answer the challenges presented by the act in addition approximately 80 of our pffs enrollees at january 1 2009 reside in geographies where we have developed a ppo network and offer a ppo plan we will continue to develop our ppo network and build networkbased plan offerings to address the network restriction nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those initiatives failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our quarterly government segment earnings and operating cash flows are particularly impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the government segment’s benefit ratio generally improves as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as yearoveryear changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products standard enhanced and complete affect the quarterly benefit ratio pattern 

commercial segment 

we continue to increase the diversification of our commercial segment membership commercial segment medical membership increased 169200 members or 49 from december 31 2007 to 3620800 members at december 31 2008 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of cariten and osf discussed more fully below which together added approximately 83100 fullyinsured members and 51300 aso members the remaining increase primarily was due to enrollment gains in strategic areas of commercial growth individual membership increased 32 smart plans and other consumer offerings membership grew 19 and small group membership was up 1 at december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 

in addition our commercial segment revenues grew in 2008 through expanded and new specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of compbenefits and kmg in the fourth quarter of 2007 these acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings including vision and other voluntary employee benefits including supplemental health products such as cancer critical illness and accident policies along with our 2005 acquisition of corphealth inc dba lifesynch a behavioral health care 

  

management company these specialty acquisitions are anticipated to enhance our commercial segment margins and our ability to appeal to more customers seeking benefit providers who offer fullservice solutions 

recent turmoil in the financial markets 

recently the securities and credit markets have been experiencing severe volatility and disturbance increasing risk with respect to our financial assets at december 31 2008 cash cash equivalents and our investment securities totaled 72 billion or 551 of total assets with 274 of the 72 billion invested in cash and cash equivalents investment securities consist primarily of debt securities of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating by sp of aa at december 31 2008 and an average duration of approximately 42 years including cash and cash equivalents the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately 34 years we had 76 million of mortgagebacked securities associated with alta or subprime loans at december 31 2008 and no collateralized debt obligations 

gross unrealized losses of 3130 million at december 31 2008 primarily were caused by an increase in interest rates from a widening of credit spreads all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities after taking into account these and other factors including severity length of time of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and as such no impairment was required 

during 2008 we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of 1031 million of which 687 million resulted from investments in lehman brothers holdings inc lehman or its subsidiaries lehman and certain of its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008 the other impairments primarily relate to declines in values of securities primarily associated with the financial services industry of the 1031 million 485 million was allocated to the government segment and 546 million was allocated to the commercial segment 

we continuously review our investment portfolios given current market conditions there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

in addition during 2008 we terminated all interestrate swap agreements outstanding associated with our senior notes based on recent changes in the credit market environment in exchange for terminating these interestrate swap agreements we received cash of 930 million representing the fair value of the swap assets this transaction also fixes the interest rate on our senior notes to a weightedaverage rate of 608 we may reenter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors 

the availability of liquidity and credit capacity in general has been impacted by the current conditions in the financial markets we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future as well as refinance debt as it matures our longterm debt consisting primarily of senior notes of 19370 million represented 303 of total capitalization at december 31 2008 the earliest maturity of our senior notes is in june 2016 we have available a 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires in july 2011 as of december 31 2008 there was 250 million in borrowings outstanding under this credit agreement primarily related to funding the acquisition of cariten described below 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and 

  

statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

based on the statutory financial statements as of december 31 2008 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 35 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries 14 billion above the aggregate 21 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 

other highlights 

 

  

  

 we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year including the primary factors that accounted for those changes

comparison of results of operations for 2008 and 2007 

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

  

    

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

 these tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows 

summary 

net income was 6472 million or 383 per diluted common share in 2008 compared to 8337 million or 491 per diluted common share in 2007 the yearoveryear decline primarily reflects lower operating earnings in our government segment as a result of higher expenses associated with our medicare standalone pdp products and lower net investment income primarily due to otherthantemporary impairments in our investment portfolios of 653 million or 039 per diluted common share 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 37 billion or 149 to 281 billion for 2008 compared to 244 billion for 2007 primarily due to higher premium revenues in both the government and commercial segments premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 28 billion or 150 to 210 billion for 2008 compared to 182 billion for 2007 primarily attributable to higher average medicare advantage membership and an increase in per member premiums partially offset by a decrease in our medicare standalone pdp membership average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period average medicare advantage membership increased 187 in 2008 compared to 2007 sales of our ppo and pffs products drove the majority of the 292900 increase in medicare advantage members since december 31 2007 the cariten osf securehorizons and metcare acquisitions also added 94900 medicare hmo and ppo members medicare advantage per member premiums increased 39 during 2008 compared to 2007 medicare standalone pdp premium revenues decreased 79 during the 2008 period compared to the 2007 period primarily due to a 375400 or 109 decrease in pdp membership since december 31 2007 

  

commercial segment premium revenues increased 09 billion or 145 to 71 billion for 2008 primarily due to our specialty product offerings including dental vision and other supplemental health and life products as a result of the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007 as well as strategic lineofbusiness organic growth our fullyinsured membership increased 94 or 170200 members to 1978800 at december 31 2008 compared to 1808600 at december 31 2007 excluding 83100 fullyinsured members added with the acquisitions of cariten and osf the increase primarily was due to membership gains in smart plans and other consumer offerings individual and small group product lines we are targeting these product lines for strategic growth in this segment 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees were 4519 million for 2008 an increase of 604 million or 154 from 3915 million for 2007 primarily due to higher rates a shift in the mix of commercial segment membership towards higher rate groups and the impact from acquisitions 

investment income 

investment income totaled 2202 million for 2008 a decrease of 940 million from 3142 million for 2007 primarily reflecting otherthantemporary impairments in our investment and securities lending portfolios of 1031 million recorded during 2008 of the 1031 million 485 million was allocated to the government segment and 546 million was allocated to the commercial segment excluding these realized losses investment income increased primarily due to higher average invested balances and net realized capital gains partially offset by lower interest rates higher average invested balances primarily resulted from the reinvestment of operating cash flow and the acquired investment portfolio related to the kmg acquisition 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 2094 million for 2008 an increase of 595 million from 1499 million for 2007 the increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to right sourcerx sm  our mailorder pharmacy 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expense was 237 billion for 2008 an increase of 34 billion or 170 from 203 billion for 2007 the increase primarily was driven by an increase in government segment benefit expense 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2008 was 845 a 150 basis point increase from 830 for 2007 the increase primarily was attributable to a higher government segment benefit ratio 

the government segment’s benefit expenses increased 27 billion or 179 during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in the average number of medicare advantage members the government segment’s benefit ratio for 2008 was 859 a 210 basis point increase from 2007 of 838 primarily due to a higher medicare standalone pdp benefit ratio from higher prescription drug utilization and an increase in the percentage of higher cost members in both our standard and enhanced plans 

the commercial segment’s benefit expense increased 7094 million or 142 from 2008 to 2007 this increase primarily resulted from the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2007 an increase in fullyinsured membership and an increase in average per member claim costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation the benefit ratio for the commercial segment of 803 for 2008 decreased 20 basis points from the 2007 benefit ratio of 805 primarily reflecting an increase in average members in our specialty products from the acquisition of compbenefits in the fourth quarter of 2007 and organic growth in our individual line of business individual and specialty primarily dental and vision accounts generally carry a lower benefit ratio and a higher sga expense ratio compared to larger accounts due to higher distribution costs see related sga expense ratio discussion in the following section 

  

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 4682 million or 135 during 2008 compared to 2007 the increases primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the medicare growth and the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions the number of employees increased by 3900 to 28900 at december 31 2008 from 25000 at december 31 2007 or 156 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2008 was 137 decreasing 20 basis points from 139 for 2007 primarily due to improving administrative cost efficiency associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage and commercial medical membership partially offset by growth in certain of our businesses which carry a higher administrative expense load such as mailorder pharmacy specialty products and individual medical products the consolidated sga expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 13 to 14 for 2009 

our government and commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 1809 million or 89 during 2008 compared to 2007 the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 112 for 2007 to 106 for 2008 the decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average medicare advantage membership 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 2873 million or 200 during 2008 compared to 2007 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 90 basis points from 215 for 2007 to 224 for 2008 the increases primarily were due to an increase in specialty business including the acquisition of compbenefits and kmg in the fourth quarter of 2007 together with higher average individual product membership and increased mailorder pharmacy business average individual product membership increased 405 during 2008 compared to 2007 specialty and individual accounts bear a higher sga expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2008 totaled 2204 million compared to 1848 million for 2007 an increase of 356 million or 193 reflecting higher intangible amortization expense due to acquisitions and increased capital expenditures 

interest expense 

interest expense was 803 million for 2008 compared to 689 million for 2007 an increase of 114 million primarily due to higher average outstanding debt partially offset by lower rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2008 of 348 compared to the effective tax rate of 353 for 2007 the decrease primarily was due to a lower combined state income tax rate and a greater proportion of taxexempt investment income to total pretax income in 2008 see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate we expect the 2009 effective tax rate to be in the range of 34 to 35 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2007 and 2006 

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

  

    

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

 these tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion that follows 

summary 

net income was 8337 million or 491 per diluted common share in 2007 compared to 4874 million or 290 per diluted common share in 2006 the yearoveryear increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher operating earnings in our government segment largely due to increased premium revenue from higher average medicare membership 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 37 billion or 179 to 244 billion for 2007 compared to 207 billion for 2006 primarily due to higher premium revenues in the government segment premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 36 billion or 248 to 182 billion for 2007 compared to 146 billion for 2006 primarily attributable to higher average medicare membership from the expanded participation in various medicare products average medicare advantage membership increased 264 for 2007 compared to 2006 sales of our pffs products drove the majority of the 140400 increase in ending medicare advantage members since december 31 2006 average medicare standalone pdp membership increased 195 for 2007 compared to 2006 

commercial segment premium revenues increased 818 million or 13 to 62 billion for 2007 primarily due to our specialty product offerings including dental vision and other supplemental health and life products as a result of the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions increases in average fullyinsured per member premiums 

  

were offset by a decrease in average fullyinsured membership average fullyinsured group membership decreased 69 for 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a large group account moving from fullyinsured to aso on july 1 2006 partially offset by membership gains in strategic areas of commercial growth including smart plans and other consumer offerings individual and small group product lines average per member premiums for our fullyinsured group medical members increased approximately 52 from 2006 to 2007 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees were 3915 million for 2007 an increase of 503 million or 147 from 3412 million for 2006 the increase was due to increases in both our government and commercial segments 

for the government segment administrative services fees increased 242 million or 490 to 737 million for 2007 as a result of the defenseweb acquisition and the award of a new puerto rico aso contract during the fourth quarter of 2006 

for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 261 million or 89 from 2918 million for 2006 to 3179 million for 2007 primarily from higher average aso membership increasing 57 for 2007 compared to 2006 

investment income 

investment income totaled 3142 million for 2007 an increase of 223 million from 2919 million for 2006 primarily due to higher average investment balances in 2007 partially offset by a decrease in realized gains related to the sale of venture capital investments in 2006 investment income for 2006 included a 517 million realized gain related to the sale of a venture capital investment in the first quarter 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 1499 million for 2007 an increase of 956 million from 543 million for 2006 the increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to right sourcerx sm  our mailorder pharmacy 

benefit expense 

consolidated benefit expense was 203 billion for 2007 an increase of 29 billion or 167 from 174 billion for 2006 the increase primarily was driven by the increase in the average number of medicare members and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation 

the consolidated benefit ratio for 2007 was 830 a 100 basis point decrease from 840 for 2006 the decrease primarily was attributable to improvements in the benefit ratio for both the commercial and government segments as described below 

the government segment’s benefit expenses increased 29 billion or 230 during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in the average number of medicare members including those enrolled in our pdps and to a lesser extent an increase in average per member claims costs 

the government segment’s benefit ratio for 2007 was 838 a 120 basis point decrease from 2006 of 850 the decrease in the benefit ratio resulted from the combination of the extended enrollment period in 2006 improvement in the standalone pdp complete plan changes in estimates associated with our 2006 medicare part d reconciliation with cms as well as the settlement of some tricare contractual provisions related to prior years part d benefit designs result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibilities for total 

  

pharmacy costs in the early stages of a member’s plan period and less in the later stages resulting in a declining benefit ratio as the year progresses an extended enrollment period in 2006 which ended june 30 2006 skewed the standard pattern associated with the progression of members through the stages of medicare part d benefits regarding the complete plan benefit design changes improved the performance of that offering changes in estimates associated with our 2006 medicare part d reconciliation with cms and the settlement of some tricare contractual provisions related to the prior years decreased the benefit ratio 40 basis points for 2007 these changes in estimates resulted from 1 the resolution of first year medicare part d implementation matters including enrollment discrepancies and 2 the adjustment of certain tricare reserves as a result of the settlement of claims payment accuracy and risk share provisions for prior option periods 

the commercial segment’s benefit expenses decreased 62 million or 01 from 2006 to 2007 this decrease primarily results from the decrease in fullyinsured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs due to medical expense inflation 

the benefit ratio for the commercial segment of 805 for 2007 decreased 120 basis points from the 2006 benefit ratio of 817 the decrease in the benefit ratio primarily reflects an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fullyinsured block the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions which added dental vision and other supplemental health and life members and improving medical cost utilization individual and smaller group as well as specialty primarily dental and vision accounts generally carry a lower benefit ratio and a higher sga expense ratio compared to larger accounts due to higher distribution costs see related sga expense ratio discussion in the following section 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 4550 million or 151 during 2007 compared to 2006 the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the medicare expansion expenses associated with right sourcerx sm  our mailorder pharmacy and higher medicare marketing expenses associated with higher sales goals for 2008 compared to 2007 the number of employees increased by 2700 to 25000 at december 31 2007 from 22300 at december 31 2006 or 121 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2007 was 139 decreasing 40 basis points from 143 for 2006 the sga expense ratio decrease resulted from improving administrative cost efficiency associated with servicing our members offset by our expanding mailorder pharmacy business as well as differences in the composition of our medical membership portfolio for 2007 versus 2006 

our government and commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 3120 million or 180 during 2007 compared to 2006 the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 118 for 2006 to 112 for 2007 the decrease primarily resulted from efficiency gains associated with servicing higher average medicare membership 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 1430 million or 111 during 2007 compared to 2006 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 150 basis points from 200 for 2006 to 215 for 2007 this increase primarily resulted from the continued shift in the mix of membership towards aso an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our fullyinsured membership and administrative costs associated with increased business for our mailorder pharmacy for 2007 468 of our commercial segment average medical membership was related to aso business compared to 445 for 2006 likewise at december 31 2007 293 of our commercial segment average medical membership was related to individual and small group accounts compared to 277 at december 31 2006 fee based aso business carries 

  

a higher sga expense ratio than fullyinsured business since there is no benefit expense or offsetting premium revenue additionally individual and smaller group accounts bear a higher sga expense ratio due to higher distribution costs as compared to larger accounts 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2007 totaled 1848 million compared to 1486 million for 2006 an increase of 362 million or 244 the increase primarily resulted from increased capital expenditures related to the medicare expansion 

interest expense 

interest expense was 689 million for 2007 compared to 631 million for 2006 an increase of 58 million primarily due to higher average outstanding debt partially offset by lower interest rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2007 of 353 compared to the effective tax rate of 360 for 2006 the decrease is primarily due to a lower state tax rate the lower state tax rate resulted from a shift in the geographic mix of revenues to states with lower tax rates see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 —financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums aso fees and investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments sga expenses interest on borrowings taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures and repayments on borrowings because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing premiums and enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing premiums and enrollment the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital 

cash and cash equivalents decreased to 19704 million at december 31 2008 from 20405 million at december 31 2007 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash flow from operating activities 

the decrease in operating cash flows for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily resulted from decreased earnings associated with higher standalone pdp claims the decrease in operating cash flows for 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the timing of cash flows associated with our medicare part d offerings offset by medicare enrollment growth and improved earnings during 2007 we paid 7255 million to cms under the risk corridor terms of our 2006 contracts with cms 

  

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and aso fees and payments of benefit expenses we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees the claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the increase in base receivables from 2007 to 2008 compared to a decrease from 2006 to 2007 

the changes in medicare receivables over the last three years have been impacted by the growth in our medicare business and the timing of accruals and related collections associated with the cms riskadjustment model 

the 373 million increase in commercial and other receivables from 2007 to 2008 primarily was the result of an increase in puerto rico medicaid receivables which were collected in january 2009 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

   

 

    the increase in benefits payable during 2008 and 2007 primarily was due to the increase in ibnr from growth in medicare advantage members and to a lesser extent benefit claims inflation an increase in the amount of processed but unpaid claims including pharmacy claims which fluctuate due to monthend cutoff and an increase in amounts owed to providers under capitated and risk sharing arrangements from medicare advantage membership growth 

cash flow from investing activities 

cash consideration paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 4229 million in 2008 and 4935 million in 2007 primarily related to the securehorizons osf and cariten acquisitions in 2008 and the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions in 2007 we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily fixed income securities totaling 6855 million in 2008 4301 million in 2007 and 8621 million in 2006 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 2616 million in 2008 2392 million in 2007 and 1932 million in 2006 excluding acquisitions we expect total capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately 260 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

during 2008 the net repayment of 550 million under our credit agreement primarily related to amounts repaid from the issuance of 750 million in senior notes offset by the 250 million financing of the cariten acquisition net borrowings of 350 million under our credit agreement during 2007 primarily related to the financing of the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions during 2006 net borrowings of 250 million primarily related to the funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries in conjunction with growth in medicare revenues offset by amounts repaid from the issuance of senior notes 

during 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 our net proceeds reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering were 7426 million we used the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement 

during 2006 we issued 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 our net proceeds reduced for the original issue discount and cost of the offering were 4943 million we used the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement which at the time of the issuance was 200 million and the repayment of our 300 million 725 senior notes which matured on august 1 2006 

  

receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies for which we do not assume risk were 1887 million higher than claims payments during 2008 and 1851 million less than the corresponding claim payments during 2007 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

in exchange for terminating interestrate swap agreements in 2008 we received cash of 930 million 

the remainder of the cash used in or provided by financing activities in 2008 2007 and 2006 primarily resulted from the change in the securities lending payable common stock repurchases the excess tax benefit from stock compensation and proceeds from stock option exercises the decrease in securities lending in 2008 resulted from the tightening of the credit markets while the increase in 2007 and 2006 coincides with higher average balances of investments to lend during 2008 we repurchased 21 million common shares for 928 million under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors we also acquired common shares in connection with employee stock plans for an aggregate cost of 133 million in 2008 274 million in 2007 and 262 million in 2006 

future sources and uses of liquidity 

stock repurchase plan 

on february 22 2008 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 21 million shares in open market transactions for 928 million at an average price of 4419 on july 28 2008 announced august 4 2008 the board of directors increased the authorized amount to 250 million excluding the 928 million used prior to that time in connection with the initial february 2008 authorization the shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market by block purchases or in privatelynegotiated transactions subject to certain restrictions on volume pricing and timing due to continued volatility and turmoil in the financial markets we have not yet repurchased any shares under the july 2008 authorization the presentlyauthorized share repurchase program expires on december 31 2009 

senior notes 

during 2008 we issued 500 million of 720 senior notes due june 15 2018 and 250 million of 815 senior notes due june 15 2038 the 720 and 815 senior notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded or subsequently upgraded and contain a change of control provision that may require us to purchase the notes under certain circumstances we also previously issued 300 million of 630 senior notes due august 1 2018 and 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 all four series of our senior notes which are unsecured may be redeemed at our option at any time at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued interest and a specified makewhole amount concurrent with the senior notes issuances we entered into interestrate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor during 2008 we terminated all of our swap agreements we may reenter into swap agreements in the future depending on market conditions and other factors our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

our 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in july 2011 under the credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the spread currently 35 basis points varies depending on our credit ratings ranging from 27 to 80 basis points we 

  

also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 10 basis points may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points depending upon our credit ratings in addition a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50 of the total 10 billion commitment the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor at our option 

the terms of the credit agreement include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse event clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds in addition the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth of 28681 million at december 31 2008 and a maximum leverage ratio of 301 we are in compliance with the financial covenants with actual net worth of 44572 million and a leverage ratio of 141 as measured in accordance with the credit agreement as of december 31 2008 

at december 31 2008 we had 250 million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement at an interest rate which varies with libor of 098 in addition we have outstanding letters of credit of 31 million secured under the credit agreement no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit accordingly as of december 31 2008 we had 7469 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement none of which would be restricted by our financial covenant compliance requirement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement 

other longterm borrowings 

other longterm borrowings of 381 million at december 31 2008 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in the 2007 kmg acquisition of 361 million and financing for the renovation of a building of 20 million the junior subordinated debt which is due in 2037 may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 802 payable quarterly until 2012 and then payable at a floating rate based on libor plus 310 basis points the debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 200 is collateralized by the building and is payable in various installments through 2014 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreement or from other public or private financing sources taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and to refinance debt as it matures see the section entitled “risk factors” in this report 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2008 was bbb according to standard  poor’s rating services or sp and baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s a downgrade by sp to bb or by moody’s to ba1 triggers an interest rate increase of 25 basis points with respect to 750 million of our senior notes successive one notch downgrades increase the interest rate an additional 25 basis points up to a maximum 100 basis points 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company decreased 2852 million to 2505 million at december 31 2008 compared to 5357 million at december 31 2007 primarily due to cash consideration paid for our 2008 acquisitions we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our stateregulated operating subsidiaries subject to appropriate regulatory approval we expect to dividend approximately 500 million from our subsidiaries to the parent during 2009 compared to 2960 million in 2008 in addition we expect capital contributions to our subsidiaries to be less than the 2428 million contributed in 2008 

  

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

although minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level based on the statutory financial statements as of december 31 2008 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 35 billion in our state regulated subsidiaries 14 billion above the aggregate 21 billion in applicable statutory requirements which would trigger any regulatory action by the respective states 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2008 as follows 

 

  

      

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2008 we are not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

related parties 

no related party transactions had a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 23 2009—see “certain transactions with management and others” 

government contracts 

our medicare business which accounted for approximately 60 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily consisted of products covered under the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan contracts with the federal government these contracts are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare business have been renewed for 2009 

cms has announced that it will perform audits of selected medicare advantage plans each year to validate the provider coding practices under the riskadjustment model used to reimburse medicare advantage plans these audits will involve a comprehensive review of medical records and may result in contractlevel payment adjustments to premium payments made to a health plan pursuant to its medicare contract with cms or other payment reductions the first data validation audits will focus on riskadjustment data for 2006 used to determine 2007 payment amounts 

several humana contracts are included in audits being undertaken by cms if necessary based on audit results cms may make contractlevel payment adjustments that may occur during 2009 and adjustments may occur prior to humana or other medicare advantage plans having the opportunity to appeal audit findings we primarily rely on providers to appropriately document riskadjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions which we send to cms as the basis for our riskadjustment model premium we are working with cms and our industry group to develop an orderly audit process for which cms 

  

has not yet indicated the complete details therefore we are unable to predict the complete audit methodology to be used by cms the outcome of these audits or whether these audits would result in a payment adjustment however it is reasonably possible that a payment adjustment as a result of these audits could occur and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our military services business which accounted for approximately 12 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily consisted of the tricare south region contract the 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2009 was subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year at the government’s option on january 16 2009 we entered into an amendment of solicitationmodification of contract to the tricare south region contract the amendment added one additional oneyear option period the sixth option period which runs from april 1 2009 through march 31 2010 and two additional sixmonth option periods the seventh option period runs from april 1 2010 through september 30 2010 and the eighth option period runs from october 1 2010 through march 31 2011 exercise of each of the sixth seventh and eighth option periods is at the government’s option under these extensions government requirements terms and conditions will remain the same as the current contract on january 22 2009 we were notified by the government of its intent to exercise its option to extend the tricare contract for the sixth option period as required under the contract the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for each option period are negotiated any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on us these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

on march 24 2008 the department of defense issued its formal request for proposal for new contracts for tricare medical benefits nationwide we submitted our bid in june 2008 and after discussions with the department of defense submitted our final proposal revisions in january 2009 if we are not awarded a new tricare contract it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 2 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2008 consisted of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico in august 2008 we renewed our medicaid contracts with the puerto rico insurance administration for the east and southeast regions these contracts expire on june 30 2009 we also provide services under a threeyear aso contract with the puerto rico health administration for the metro north region the puerto rico health administration did not renew the third year of the aso contract and the contract expired september 30 2008 the loss of this contract did not have a material effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

the loss of any of the contracts above exclusive of the threeyear puerto rico aso contract or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts 

  

reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

benefit expense recognition 

benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 

 

 military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data this amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government as more fullydescribed on page 47 

estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results of operations and overall financial position accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” as such we expect that substantially all of the december 31 2008 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2009 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a 

  

given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including receipt cycle times claim inventory levels recoveries of overpayments outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years for example the average receipt cycle time has decreased from 159 days in 2006 to 150 days in 2008 which represents a 60 reduction in cycle time over the three year period if claims are submitted or processed on a faster slower pace than prior periods the actual claim may be more less complete than originally estimated using our completion factors which may result in reserves that are higher lower than required 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2008 data 

 

   

 

   the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 

 

 the following table summarizes the changes in estimate for incurred claims related to prior years attributable to our key assumptions as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend and completion factors estimated using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions the amounts below represent the difference between our original estimates and the actual benefit expenses ultimately incurred as determined from subsequent claim payments 

 

  

 as summarized in the table above the majority of the favorable development resulted from trend factors for the most recent three months ultimately being lower than originally estimated for each of the years presented several factors drove the actual trend factors lower than the originally estimated trends 

 

  

   

 additionally actual completion factors ultimately were higher than our original completion factors used to establish reserves at december 31 2007 and 2006 which were based upon historical patterns this increase in completion factor percentage primarily resulted from a shortening of the cycle time associated with provider claim submissions and changes in claim payment and recovery patterns associated with outsourcing claims processing functions for our medicare private feeforservice product 

finally firstyear medicare part d enrollment and eligibility issues during 2006 led to actual claim settlements with other health plans and various state governments during 2007 for amounts less than originally estimated similar adjustments in 2008 were not significant due to a lower volume of new enrollees and improvements in the program’s enrollment process in 2007 

we have adjusted for the favorable historical trend and completion factor experience together with our knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends and completion factors when establishing our reserves at december 31 2008 however based on our historical experience it is reasonably likely that our actual trend and completion factors may vary from the factors used in our december 31 2008 estimates any variances are expected to be within the ranges previously presented in our sensitivity analysis table 

benefit expenses associated with military services and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 our tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk of financing health benefits the federal government both reimburses us for our cost of providing health benefits and bears responsibility for 80 of any variance from the annual target health care cost and actual health care cost as more fully described beginning on page 60 therefore the impact on our income from operations from changes in estimate for tricare benefits payable is reduced substantially by corresponding adjustments to revenues the net increase decrease to income from operations as determined retrospectively after giving consideration to claim development occurring in the current period was approximately 137 million for 2007 and 11 million for 2006 the impact from changes in estimates for 2008 is not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in 2009 will change as our december 31 2008 benefits payable estimate develops throughout 2009 

future policy benefits payable of 11648 million and 9807 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including life insurance annuities health and longterm care policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest rates mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience the basis for the liability for future policy benefits is established at the time each contract is acquired and would only change if our experience deteriorates to the point the level of the liability is not adequate to provide for future policy benefits future policy benefits payable include 5032 million at december 31 2008 and 3075 million at december 31 2007 

  

associated with a closed block of longterm care policies acquired in connection with the november 30 2007 kmg acquisition longterm care policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge many years after assumptions have been established the risk of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from those assumed in our reserves are particularly significant to our closed block of longterm care policies we monitor the loss experience of these longterm care policies and when necessary apply for premium rate increases through a regulatory filing and approval process in the jurisdictions in which such products were sold we expect to file premium rate increases in 2009 to the extent premium rate increases or loss experience vary from our acquisition date assumptions future adjustments to reserves could be required in addition future policy benefits payable include amounts of 2320 million at december 31 2008 and 2397 million at december 31 2007 which are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets 

as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant an increase in the absolute dollar amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has resulted from the growth in our medicare business coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices when we recognize a release of the redundancy we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business if material we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group an individual or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and members in our medicare and individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from cms for our medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in riskadjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare part d provisions 

on january 1 2006 we began covering prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d under multiple contracts with cms the payments we receive monthly from cms and members which are determined from our annual bid represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage we recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract 

  

our cms payment is subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions in addition we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk as described more fully below 

the risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period accordingly this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience we record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or longterm in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement 

the estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including among others member eligibility differences with cms in 2008 we paid 787 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2007 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 1026 million at december 31 2007 in 2007 we paid 7255 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2006 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 7387 million at december 31 2006 2006 marked the first year of providing for the risk corridor estimate and required us to consider factors which were not certain including certain first year implementation issues the net asset associated with the 2008 risk corridor estimate which will be settled in 2009 was 554 million at december 31 2008 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for cms’s portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and related settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year we account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize premium revenues or benefit expense for these subsidies receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period gross financing receipts were 27613 million and gross financing withdrawals were 25726 million during 2008 cms subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2008 was 3221 million to other current assets and 2197 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 

in order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage cms provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage or coverage beyond cms’s defined standard benefits the demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which cms pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government’s portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage the capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer we chose the demonstration payment option for all of our enhanced benefit plans for 2006 through 2008 but not for 2009 this capitation amount derived from our annual bid submissions is recorded as premium revenue the variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 9 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program 

  

medicare riskadjustment provisions 

cms has implemented a riskadjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity the cms riskadjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs as more fully described in item 1—business beginning on page 5 under this riskadjustment methodology diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us we primarily rely on providers to appropriately document riskadjustment data in their medical records and appropriately code their claim submissions which we send to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate riskadjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms we do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our standalone pdp members 

military services 

in 2008 military services revenues represented 12 of total premiums and administrative services fees military services revenue primarily is derived from our tricare south region contract with the department of defense and in addition beginning january 1 2008 from our contract with the department of veterans affairs revenues associated with our contract with the department of veterans affairs are recognized in the period services are performed the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative services fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment disease management and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

the tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target health care cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses we continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

the military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

  

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 52154 million or 40 of total assets at december 31 2008 and 46504 million or 36 of total assets at december 31 2007 debt securities detailed below comprised over 99 of this investment portfolio the fair value of debt securities were as follows at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

 more than 98 of our debt securities were of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2008 most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end bb or better of the noninvestment grade spectrum our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

us government and agency obligations include 14316 million at december 31 2008 and 7918 million at december 31 2007 of debt securities issued by agencies of the us government including federal national mortgage association or fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage association or freddie mac whose principal payment is guaranteed by the us government 

tax exempt municipal securities included prerefunded bonds of 6948 million at december 31 2008 and 1822 million at december 31 2007 these prerefunded bonds are secured by an escrow fund consisting of us government obligations sufficient to pay off all amounts outstanding at maturity the ratings of these prerefunded bonds generally assume the rating of the government obligations aaa by sp at the time the fund is established in addition certain monoline insurers guarantee the timely repayment of bond principal and interest when a bond issuer defaults and generally provide credit enhancement for bond issues related to our tax exempt municipal securities we have no direct exposure to these monoline insurers we owned 4524 million and 6624 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively of tax exempt securities guaranteed by monoline insurers the equivalent sp credit rating of these taxexempt securities without the guarantee from the monoline insurer was aa 

our direct exposure to subprime mortgage lending is limited to investment in residential mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities backed by home equity loans the fair value of securities backed by alta and subprime loans was 76 million at december 31 2008 and 220 million at december 31 2007 there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio 

the percentage of corporate securities associated with the financial services industry was 424 at december 31 2008 and 484 at december 31 2007 

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 42 years at december 31 2008 including cash equivalents the average duration was approximately 34 years based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 229 million 

  

we participate in a securities lending program where we loan certain investment securities for short periods of time in exchange for collateral consisting of cash or us government securities initially equal to at least 102 of the fair value of the investment securities on loan investment securities with a fair value of 4371 million at december 31 2008 and 13361 million at december 31 2007 were on loan all collateral from lending our investment securities was in the form of cash deposited by the borrower with an independent lending agent the cash collateral was invested in money market funds certificates of deposit and shortterm corporate and assetbacked securities with an average maturity of approximately 250 days the fair value of securities held as invested collateral was 4024 million at december 31 2008 and 13370 million at december 31 2007 the amortized cost of these investment securities was 4372 million at december 31 2008 and 13370 million at december 31 2007 unrealized losses of 348 million at december 31 2008 have been included as a component of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income 

gross unrealized losses and fair value of investment securities aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2008 

 

 we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment we consider factors affecting the issuer factors affecting the industry the issuer operates within and general debt and equity market trends we consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value the severity of the decline the near term prospects for recovery to cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment given current market conditions there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material realized losses from sales or otherthantemporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 

unrealized losses at december 31 2008 resulted from 581 positions out of a total of 1200 positions held with approximately 142 positions in an unrealized loss position greater than one year the unrealized losses at december 31 2008 primarily were caused by an increase in interest rate from a widening of credit spreads all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities 

  

after taking into account these and other factors including the severity of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and as such no impairment was required 

during 2008 we recognized otherthantemporary impairments of 1031 million including credit related writedowns of 829 million and interestrelated writedowns of 202 million the creditrelated impairments in 2008 primarily were due to investments in lehman and certain of its subsidiaries which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008 the interestrelated impairments were due to declines in values of securities primarily associated with the financial services industry for which we were uncertain of our intent to hold until recovery or maturity there were no material otherthantemporary impairments in 2007 and 2006 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2008 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 23 of total assets and 67 of total stockholders’ equity compared to 20 and 63 respectively at december 31 2007 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas 142 requires that we test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit either is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments referred to as a component which comprise our reportable commercial and government segments a component is considered a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by management we are required to aggregate the components of an operating segment into one reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are performed at a minimum annually in the fourth quarter and are based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios we rely on this discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value however outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis are compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we use a range of discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital we also use a range of terminal growth rates that correspond to longterm growth prospects consistent with the longterm inflation rate key assumptions in our cash flow projections including changes in membership premium yields medical and administrative cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss the fair value of our reporting units with significant goodwill exceeded carrying amounts by a margin ranging from approximately 76 to 94 a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease this margin to a range of approximately 54 to 79 and a 50 basis point decrease in the terminal growth rate would decrease this margin to a range of approximately 67 to 88 the loss of the tricare south region contract instead of the expected april 1 2010 renewal would adversely affect approximately 50 million of the reporting unit’s goodwill 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no impairment losses in the last three years

our control environment is the foundation for our system of internal control over financial reporting and is embodied in our business ethics policy it sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures which are reviewed modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations 

the audit committee of the board of directors which is composed solely of independent outside directors meets periodically with members of management the internal auditors and our independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss internal controls over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors report to the audit committee and accordingly have full and free access to the audit committee at any time 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the company including its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to members of senior management and the board of directors 

based on our evaluation as of december 31 2008 we as the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer of the company have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported as specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

we assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we determined that as of december 31 2008 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria 

in conducting management’s evaluation as described above securehorizons osf metcare and cariten all acquired during 2008 were excluded these operations which are included in the 2008 consolidated financial statements of the company constituted less than 2 of the company’s consolidated revenues and income before income taxes for the year ended december 31 2008 and less than 6 of total assets as of december 31 2008 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp our independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the company’s consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k as stated in their report which appears on page 102 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

on january 1 2009 the company implemented a new general ledger system this implementation was part of our routine and ongoing process of upgrading and enhancing our financial systems and was not in response to any internal control deficiency as appropriate the company is modifying the design and documentation of internal control process and procedures relating to the new system to supplement and complement existing internal controls over financial reporting

 item 1 business tableend general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc referred to throughout this document as “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “humana” is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies based on our 2007 revenues of 253 billion we are a fullservice benefits solutions company offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit plans for employer groups government benefit programs and individuals as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 115 million members in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 68 million members in our specialty products during 2007 71 of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government including 17 related to our contracts in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms and 12 related to our military services contracts under our cms contracts in florida we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 507700 members as of december 31 2007 

we were organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 and our website address is wwwhumanacom 

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a—risk factors for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results or business 

business segments 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas 131  which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

  

our products 

as more fully described in the products discussion that follows we provide health insurance benefits under health maintenance organization or hmo private feeforservice or pffs and preferred provider organization or ppo plans in addition we provide other benefits with our specialty products including dental vision and other supplementary benefits the following table presents our segment membership at december 31 2007 and premiums and administrative services only or aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2007 

 

 our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries 

medicare 

we have participated in the medicare program for private health plans for over 20 years since recent significant changes were made to the medicare program for health plans like those offered by us we have expanded from a regional to a national presence now offering at least one type of medicare plan in all 50 states the resulting growing membership base provides us with greater leverage to expand our network of ppo and hmo providers we employ strategies including health assessments and programs such as personal nurse ®  a case management and disease management program and a fitness program for seniors to guide medicare beneficiaries in making costeffective decisions with respect to their health care including cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes that result in living healthier 

  

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance prescription drug benefits are provided under part d cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program 

medicare advantage products 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month we refer to beneficiaries enrolled in these plans collectively as medicare advantage or mapd members with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of traditional medicare typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data mining techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions disease management programs wellness and prevention programs and a reduced monthly part b premium since 2006 medicare beneficiaries have had more health plan options including a prescription drug benefit option and greater access to a ppo offering with the rollout of regional ppo plans prior to 2006 ppo plans were offered on a local basis only most medicare advantage plans must offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in many cases these beneficiaries also may be required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

our medicare pffs plans have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at reimbursement rates equivalent to traditional medicare payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s risk adjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the risk adjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms transitioned to this riskbased reimbursement model while the old reimbursement model based on demographic data including gender age and disability status was phased out in 2006 the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 75 from 50 in 2005 the phasein of risk adjusted payment increased to 100 in 2007 under the risk adjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must capture collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

commensurate with phasein of the riskadjustment methodology payments to medicare advantage plans were increased by a “budget neutrality” factor the budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall 

  

health plan payments from being reduced during the transition from the previous reimbursement model based upon average original medicare feeforservice spending to the riskadjustment payment model the payment adjustments for budget neutrality were first developed in 2002 and first used with the 2003 payments 

the budget neutrality adjustment began phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by 2011 this does not mean however that the aggregate permember payments to medicare plans will be reduced as plans enroll less healthy beneficiaries the need for the budget neutrality adjustment declines as the underlying risk adjusted medicare rates paid to plans increase to account for their enrollees’ greater healthcare needs as a result of changes in the cms payment processes including the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology and the phasing out of the budget neutrality adjustment described previously our cms payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

at december 31 2007 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 1143000 mapd members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 112 billion or 450 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2007 under our medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 325000 members these contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately 42 billion which represented approximately 375 of our medicare advantage premium revenues or 168 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2007 

our hmo pffs and ppo products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare advantage business have been renewed for 2008 

medicare standalone prescription drug products 

on january 1 2006 we began offering standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our three plan choices between november 15 and december 31 for coverage that begins january 1 the enrollment period was extended to may 31 during 2006 because it was the first year of the program our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described beginning on page 56 our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare standalone pdp business have been renewed for 2008 

medicaid product 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a state specific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health 

  

insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 23 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2007 consisted of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico 

military services 

under our tricare south region contract with the department of defense we provide health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in a hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers similar to a ppo 

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the united states department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 29 million eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2007 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense of these eligible beneficiaries 11 million were tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries seniors over the age of 65 and beneficiaries in puerto rico for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract the tricare south region contract is for a fiveyear period subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with the fifth option period scheduled to begin april 1 2008 and run through march 31 2009 the department of defense has the option to extend the current contract for up to six months under existing terms congressional authority has also been granted to extend the contract in one year increments for a maximum of two additional years in the second quarter of 2007 a draft solicitation related to the new tricare contracts currently scheduled to begin april 1 2009 was issued for industry comment currently we are anticipating a formal request for proposal or rfp for the tricare contracts 

the tricare south region contract contains provisions that require us to negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments 

for the year ended december 31 2007 tricare premium revenues were approximately 28 billion or 114 of our total premiums and aso fees and tricare aso fees totaled 651 million or 03 of our total premiums and aso fees 

in october 2007 we were awarded the department of veterans affairs first specialty network demonstration project known as project hero healthcare effectiveness through resource optimization to support healthcare delivery to veterans the contract is comprised of one base period and four oneyear option periods subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with services beginning january 1 2008 

international and green ribbon health operations 

we established our subsidiary humana europe in the united kingdom to provide commissioning support to primary care trusts or pcts in england under the contracts we are awarded we will work in partnership with local pcts health care providers and patients to strengthen healthservice delivery and to implement strategies at a local level to help the national health service enhance patient experience improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs we are in the startup phase in anticipation of rendering services under contracts 

  

we participate in a medicare health support pilot program through green ribbon health or grh a jointventure company with pfizer health solutions inc grh is designed to support medicare beneficiaries living with diabetes andor congestive heart failure in central florida grh uses disease management initiatives including evidencebased clinical guidelines personal selfdirected change strategies and personal nurses to help participants navigate the health system revenues under the contract with cms which expires october 31 2008 unless terminated earlier are subject to refund unless a savings target is met to date all revenues have been deferred until reliable estimates are determinable 

our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members 

smart plans and other consumer products 

over the last several years we have developed and offered various commercial products designed to provide options and choices to employers that are annually facing substantial premium increases driven by doubledigit medical cost inflation these smart plans discussed more fully below and other consumer offerings which can be offered on either a fullyinsured or aso basis provided coverage to approximately 564700 members at december 31 2007 representing approximately 164 of our total commercial medical membership as detailed below 

 

 these products are often offered to employer groups as “bundles” where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the employer 

paramount to our product strategy we have developed a group of innovative consumer products styled as “smart” products that we believe will be a longterm solution for employers we believe this new generation of products provides more 1 choices for the individual consumer 2 transparency of provider costs and 3 benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions including the tradeoffs between higher premiums and pointofservice costs at the time consumers choose their plans and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans we believe that when consumers can make informed choices about the cost and effectiveness of their health care a sustainable long term solution for employers can be realized smart products which accounted for approximately 55 of enrollment in all of our consumerchoice plans as of december 31 2007 are only sold to employers who use humana as their sole health insurance carrier 

some employers have selected other types of consumerchoice products such as 1 a product with a high deductible 2 a catastrophic coverage plan or 3 ones that offer a spending account option in conjunction with more traditional medical coverage or as a stand alone plan unlike our smart products these products while valuable in helping employers deal with nearterm cost increases by shifting costs to employees are not considered by us to be longterm comprehensive solutions to the employers’ cost dilemma although we view them as an important interim step 

hmo 

our commercial hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who 

  

contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include among others hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan 

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers together with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician we participate in the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp primarily with our hmo offering in certain markets fehbp is the government’s health insurance program for federal employees retirees former employees family members and spouses for the year ended december 31 2007 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 20 billion or 81 of our total premiums and aso fees 

ppo 

our commercial ppo products which are marketed primarily to employer groups and individuals include some types of wellness and utilization management programs however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees 

as part of our ppo products we offer humanaone a major medical product marketed directly to individuals we offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels this individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses 

for the year ended december 31 2007 employer and individual commercial ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 37 billion or 147 of our total premiums and aso fees 

aso 

in addition to fullyinsured smart plans and other consumer offerings hmo and ppo products we also offer aso products to employers who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fullyinsured ppo hmo or smart plans and other consumer products described previously under aso contracts selffunded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits however most aso customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs for the year ended december 31 2007 commercial aso fees totaled 3078 million or 12 of our total premiums and aso fees 

specialty 

we also offer various specialty products including dental vision and other supplemental products during 2007 we made investments which significantly expanded our specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of compbenefits corporation and kmg america corporation these acquisitions significantly increased our dental 

  

membership and added new product offerings including vision and other supplemental health and life benefit plans primarily sold on a voluntary basis the supplemental health plans cover for example some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness at december 31 2007 we had approximately 68 million specialty members including 36 million dental members and 23 million vision members for the year ended december 31 2007 specialty product premiums and aso fees were approximately 5442 million or 22 of our total premiums and aso fees 

membership 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2007 by market and product 

 

 provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

  

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met our hospitalist programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

capitation 

for 23 of our december 31 2007 medical membership we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a benefits ratio ranging from 82 to 89 the benefits ratio measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

for another 47 of our december 31 2007 medical membership we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include physician capitation payments for services rendered we share hospital and other benefit expenses and process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

 capitation expense as a percentage of total benefit expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

   

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate hmos based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or jcaho 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commission also known as the utilization review accreditation commission or urac urac performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo accreditation specific to the utilization review process also is required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in all of our commercial hmo markets except puerto rico and in select ppo markets 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our medicare medicaid and commercial products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 1800 sales representatives who are each paid a salary and per member commission to market our medicare and medicaid products in the united states and puerto rico we employed approximately 600 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with state farm ® and usaa we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums including bonuses based on sales volume 

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the 

  

premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we also offer commercial health insurance and specialty products directly to individuals 

at december 31 2007 we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 700 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

risk management 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare military services or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described on page 17 in item 1a—risk factors 

government regulation 

federal regulation 

government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules the passing of the medicare modernization act of 2003 or mma represents the most sweeping changes to medicare since the bba in 1997 changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results also it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 

state and local regulation 

we are also subject to substantial regulation by the states in which we do business we regularly are audited and subject to various enforcement actions by state departments of insurance these departments enforce laws 

  

relating to all aspects of our operations including benefit offerings marketing claim payments subsidiary capital requirements and premium rate setting especially with regard to our small group business although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties and other sanctions against us including exclusion from participation in government programs we do not believe the results of any of these actions individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

pending federal and state legislation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives continue at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

for a complete description of all of the current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a—risk factors on page 22 

other 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses in an effort to minimize credit risk we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 25000 employees including 28 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages

 item 1a risk factors tableend this document includes both historical and forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements are made within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 we intend such forwardlooking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events trends and uncertainties these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things the information discussed below in making these statements we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results our business is highly complicated regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 

if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of benefits payable or future policy benefits payable based upon our estimates of future benefit claims are inadequate our profitability could decline 

we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future benefit claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record benefits payable for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient benefits payable or future policy benefits payable may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively our membership and profitability could decline 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program as well as in smart plans and other consumer health plans such as high deductible health plans with hsas we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationship with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract including our tricare contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our business could be materially adversely affected 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the mma the mma offers new opportunities in our medicare programs including our hmo ppo and pffs medicare advantage products as well as our standalone pdp products we have made substantial additional investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach since the enactment of the mma through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we have been approved to offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia 

the growth of our medicare business is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the medicare business which are described elsewhere in this document these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business with emphasis on our aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including our smart plans and other consumer offerings such as hsas and our specialty products as well as the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents and other stakeholders through webenabling technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

see “legal proceedings” in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty 

as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military and medicaid programs our government segment accounted for approximately 74 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2007 and we expect the government segment to account for a greater percentage of our total premiums and aso fees in 2008 these programs involve various risks including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

   

  

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including member eligibility differences with cms beginning in 2008 the risk corridor thresholds increase which means we will bear more risk our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net liability of 1026 million at december 31 2007 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 6 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including but not limited to discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or reimbursement as a lowincome or reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 

  

  

  

   

our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 

the health care industry in general and health insurance particularly hmos and ppos are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

based on the most recent statutory financial statements as of december 31 2007 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 29052 million in our state regulated subsidiaries this compares to applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 18105 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level given our anticipated continued premium growth in 2008 capital requirements will increase we expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from humana inc our parent company of approximately 200 million in 2008 

most states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define their required levels of equity discussed above rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by the remaining states and puerto rico at december 31 2007 we would have 9663 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc or individual state requirements based on the most recent statutory financial statements as of december 31 2007 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates a business associate is a person or entity other than a member of the work force who on behalf of a covered entity performs or assists in the performance of a function or activity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information or provides legal accounting consulting data aggregation management administrative accreditation or financial services 

  

laws in each of the states including puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including the scope of benefits rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations 

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance our hmos are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health audits and investigations are also conducted by state attorneys general cms the office of the inspector general of health and human services the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor and the defense contract audit agency several departments of insurance are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers particularly in the medicare marketing area all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs or the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

other areas subject to substantial regulation include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 two areas of legislation that can impact the company are experiencing an increase in activity these are medicare funding under mma and proposals to expand health insurance coverage mma funding and associated program structure is an area of substantial legislative attention that may be influenced by federal budget considerations and medicare spending trends the federal and state efforts to expand access to health coverage may offer opportunities to serve individuals who are not currently in the health insurance market through public program expansions coverage connectors or premium assistance programs some access proposals also include increased regulation of our commercial business particularly small group and individual through a combination of benefit mandates underwriting restrictions rating limitations and assessments 

state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

all of these proposals could apply to us and could result in new regulations that increase the cost of our operations 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect entry into new markets our revenues or the number of our members increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 

we are also subject to potential changes in the political environment that can affect public policy and can adversely affect the markets for our products 

while it is not possible to predict when and whether fundamental policy changes would occur these could include policy changes on the local state and federal level that could fundamentally change the dynamics of our industry such as a larger role of the government in the health care arena changes in public policy could materially affect our profitability and cash flow our ability to retain or grow our business and our financial position 

any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability while we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses increases in staffrelated expenses investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products acquisitions and implementation of regulatory requirements among others may occur from time to time 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously in 2007 we acquired kmg america corporation compbenefits corporation and defenseweb technologies inc the failure to successfully integrate each and all of these entities may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may also be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

  

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

our recently implemented mail order pharmacy business subjects us to additional regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

we have opened a mail order pharmacy business that subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailservices pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying 

  

ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such downgrades in our ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations  

recent events including fallout from problems in the us credit markets indicate a potential nearterm recession in the us economy the state of the us economy could adversely affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums the state of the us economy could also adversely affect the budget of individual states and of the federal government that could result in attempts to reduce payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare military services and medicaid programs and could result in an increase in taxes and assessments on our activities although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through among other things increases in premiums there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows

overview 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies based on our 2007 revenues of 253 billion we are a fullservice benefits solutions company offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit plans for employer groups government benefit programs and individuals as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 115 million members in our medical benefit plans as well as approximately 68 million members in our specialty products 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of sfas 131  which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing benefits and underwriting requirements these segment groupings are consistent with information used by our chief executive officer 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other revenue interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

our results are impacted by many factors but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium aso fee and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures new prescription drugs and therapies an aging population lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking the tort liability system and government regulation 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance the benefits ratio which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the selling general and administrative expense ratio or sga expense ratio which is computed by taking total selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues administrative services fees and other revenues represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

  

government segment 

our strategy and commitment to the expanded medicare programs including new product choices and pharmacy benefits for seniors has led to significant growth medicare advantage membership increased to 1143000 members at december 31 2007 up 140 from 1002600 at december 31 2006 and up 1049 from 557800 at december 31 2005 primarily due to sales of private feeforservice or pffs products average medicare advantage membership was 264 higher for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the year ended december 31 2006 and average standalone pdp membership was 195 higher likewise medicare premium revenues have increased 33 billion or 285 to 148 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 from 115 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 we expect medicare advantage membership to continue to grow into 2008 adding between 200000 and 250000 members by december 31 2008 with a shift in sales mix towards our ppo and hmo offerings 

our quarterly government segment earnings are particularly impacted by the medicare part d benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership the medicare part d benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period which begins january 1 for renewals these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages as a result the government segment’s benefits ratio generally improves as the year progresses in addition the number of lowincome senior members as well as year over year changes in the mix of membership in our standalone pdp products standard enhanced and complete affect the quarterly benefits ratio pattern we expect the combination of these items will result in a greater proportion of earnings for 2008 to be earned in the first half versus the second half when compared to the quarterly earnings pattern in 2007 

commercial segment 

we continue to increase the diversification of our commercial segment membership base and continue to exercise pricing discipline relative to our fullyinsured accounts commercial segment medical membership increased by 167800 members from december 31 2006 to 3451600 at december 31 2007 primarily as a result of the acquisition of kmg america corporation discussed more fully below which added approximately 95900 members primarily aso the remaining increase primarily was due to enrollment gains in strategic areas of commercial growth including smart plans and other consumer offerings individual small group and aso products partially offset by a decline in the fullyinsured larger group product membership membership changes from exercising pricing discipline and sales focused on strategic growth areas resulted in a decline in the benefits ratio to 805 for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 817 for the year ended december 31 2006 

in addition we are diversifying our commercial segment revenues through expanded and new specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of compbenefits corporation and kmg america corporation in the fourth quarter of 2007 each discussed further below these acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings including vision and other supplemental health and life benefit plans primarily sold on a voluntary basis the supplemental health plans cover for example some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness along with our 2005 acquisition of corphealth inc a behavioral health care management company these specialty acquisitions are anticipated to enhance our commercial segment margins and our ability to appeal to more customers

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

 these tables of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages 

summary 

net income was 8337 million or 491 per diluted common share in 2007 compared to 4874 million or 290 per diluted common share in 2006 the yearoveryear increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher operating earnings in our government segment largely due to increased premium revenue from higher average medicare membership 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 37 billion or 179 to 244 billion for 2007 compared to 207 billion for 2006 primarily due to higher premium revenues in the government segment premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership the impact of the risk corridor provisions and changes in health status factors or risk adjustment provisions 

government segment premium revenues increased 36 billion or 248 to 182 billion for 2007 compared to 146 billion for 2006 primarily attributable to higher average medicare membership from the expanded participation in various medicare products average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period average medicare advantage membership increased 264 for 2007 compared to 2006 sales of our pffs products drove the majority of the 140400 increase in ending medicare advantage members since december 31 2006 average medicare standalone pdp membership increased 195 for 2007 compared to 2006 

commercial segment premium revenues increased 818 million or 13 to 62 billion for 2007 primarily due to our specialty product offerings including dental vision and other supplemental health and life products 

  

as a result of the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions increases in average fullyinsured per member premiums were offset by a decrease in average fullyinsured membership average fullyinsured group membership decreased 69 for 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a large group account moving from fullyinsured to aso on july 1 2006 partially offset by membership gains in strategic areas of commercial growth including smart plans and other consumer offerings individual and small group product lines average per member premiums for our fullyinsured group medical members increased approximately 52 from 2006 to 2007 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees were 3915 million for 2007 an increase of 503 million or 147 from 3412 million for 2006 the increase was due to increases in both our government and commercial segments 

for the government segment administrative services fees increased 242 million or 490 to 737 million for 2007 as a result of the defenseweb acquisition and the award of a new puerto rico aso contract during the fourth quarter of 2006 

for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 261 million or 89 from 2918 million for 2006 to 3179 million for 2007 primarily from higher average aso membership increasing 57 for 2007 compared to 2006 

investment income 

investment income totaled 3142 million for 2007 an increase of 223 million from 2919 million for 2006 primarily due to higher average investment balances in 2007 partially offset by a decrease in realized gains related to the sale of venture capital investments in 2006 investment income for 2006 included a 517 million realized gain related to the sale of a venture capital investment in the first quarter 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 1499 million for 2007 an increase of 956 million from 543 million for 2006 the increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to right source sm  our mail order pharmacy 

benefit expenses 

consolidated benefit expense was 203 billion for 2007 an increase of 29 billion or 167 from 174 billion for 2006 the increase primarily was driven by the increase in the average number of medicare members and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation 

the consolidated benefits ratio for 2007 was 830 a 100 basis point decrease from 840 for 2006 the decrease primarily was attributable to improvements in the benefits ratio for both the commercial and government segments 

the government segment’s benefit expenses increased 29 billion or 230 during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in the average number of medicare members including those enrolled in our pdps and to a lesser extent an increase in average per member claims costs 

the government segment’s benefits ratio for 2007 was 838 a 120 basis point decrease from 2006 of 850 the decrease in the benefits ratio resulted from the combination of the extended enrollment period in 2006 improvement in the standalone pdp complete plan changes in estimates associated with our 2006 medicare part d reconciliation with cms as well as the settlement of some tricare contractual provisions 

  

related to prior years part d benefit designs result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibilities for total pharmacy costs in the early stages of a member’s plan period and less in the later stages resulting in a declining benefits ratio as the year progresses the extended enrollment period in 2006 which ended june 30 2006 skewed the standard pattern associated with the progression of members through the stages of medicare part d benefits regarding the complete plan benefit design changes improved the performance of that offering changes in estimates associated with our 2006 medicare part d reconciliation with cms and the settlement of some tricare contractual provisions related to the prior years decreased the benefits ratio 40 basis points for 2007 these changes in estimates resulted from 1 the resolution of first year medicare part d implementation matters including enrollment discrepancies of which similar adjustments in the future are not expected to be material due to the program’s operational improvement in 2007 and 2 the adjustment of certain tricare reserves as a result of the settlement of claims payment accuracy and risk share provisions for prior option periods 

the commercial segment’s benefit expense decreased 62 million or 01 from 2006 to 2007 this decrease primarily results from the decrease in fullyinsured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs due to medical expense inflation 

the benefits ratio for the commercial segment of 805 for 2007 decreased 120 basis points from the 2006 benefits ratio of 817 the decrease in the benefits ratio primarily reflects an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fullyinsured block the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions which added dental vision and other supplemental health and life members and improving medical cost utilization individual and smaller group as well as specialty primarily dental and vision accounts generally carry a lower benefits ratio and a higher sga expense ratio compared to larger group accounts due to higher distribution costs see related sga expense ratio discussion in the following section 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 4550 million or 151 during 2007 compared to 2006 the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the medicare expansion expenses associated with right source sm  our mail order pharmacy and higher medicare marketing expenses associated with higher sales goals for 2008 compared to 2007 the number of employees increased by 2700 to 25000 at december 31 2007 from 22300 at december 31 2006 or 121 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2007 was 139 decreasing 40 basis points from 143 for 2006 the sga expense ratio decrease resulted from improving administrative cost efficiency and productivity gains associated with servicing our members offset by our expanding mail order pharmacy business as well as differences in the composition of our medical membership portfolio for 2007 versus 2006 the consolidated sga expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 135 to 140 for 2008 

our government and commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 3120 million or 180 during 2007 compared to 2006 the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 118 for 2006 to 112 for 2007 the decrease primarily resulted from efficiency and productivity gains associated with servicing higher average medicare membership 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 1430 million or 111 during 2007 compared to 2006 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 150 basis points from 200 for 2006 to 215 for 2007 this increase primarily resulted from the continued shift in the mix of membership towards aso an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our fullyinsured membership and 

  

administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail order pharmacy for 2007 468 of our commercial segment average medical membership was related to aso business compared to 445 for 2006 likewise at december 31 2007 293 of our commercial segment average medical membership was related to individual and small group accounts compared to 277 at december 31 2006 fee based aso business carries a higher sga expense ratio than fullyinsured business since there is no benefit expense or offsetting premium revenue additionally individual and smaller group accounts carry a higher sga expense ratio due to higher distribution costs compared to larger group accounts 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2007 totaled 1848 million compared to 1486 million for 2006 an increase of 362 million or 244 the increase primarily resulted from increased capital expenditures related to the medicare expansion 

interest expense 

interest expense was 689 million for 2007 compared to 631 million for 2006 an increase of 58 million primarily due to higher average outstanding debt partially offset by lower interest rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2007 of 353 compared to the effective tax rate of 360 for 2006 the decrease is primarily due to a lower state tax rate the lower state tax rate results from a shift in the geographic mix of revenues to states with lower tax rates see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate we expect the 2008 effective tax rate to be in the range of 355 to 360 

comparison of results of operations for 2006 and 2005 

year over year comparisons have been impacted by litigation and hurricane katrina expenses in 2005 that did not recur in 2006 as more fully discussed in the following sections

2005 hurricane katrina 

certain of our operations primarily the louisiana market were negatively affected by the impact of hurricane katrina in august 2005 expenses related to hurricane katrina primarily stemmed from our efforts in cooperation with departments of insurance in the affected states to help our members by offering participatingprovider benefits at nonparticipating providers’ rates paying claims for members who were unable at the time to meet their premium obligations and similar measures in connection with hurricane katrina we recorded pretax medical and administrative expenses of 270 million 169 million after taxes or 010 per diluted common share during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 of the 270 million 59 million was included in the government segment results and the remaining 211 million was included in the commercial segment results

government segment premium revenues increased 71 billion or 936 to 146 billion for 2006 compared to 75 billion for 2005 this increase primarily was attributable to the expanded participation in various medicare products and geographic markets sales of our pffs products drove the majority of the 797

commercial segment premium revenues decreased 53 to 61 billion for 2006 compared to 65 billion for 2005 lower premium revenues primarily resulted from a reduction of fullyinsured membership our fully insured membership decreased 123 or 245600 members to 1754200 at december 31 2006 compared to 1999800 at december 31 2005 primarily as a result of continued attrition within the fullyinsured group accounts partially offset by membership gains from the cha acquisition and membership increases in the individual as well as smart plans and other consumer product lines attrition in the fullyinsured group accounts results from a competitive pricing environment average per member premiums for our fullyinsured group medical members increased approximately 57 from 2005 to 2006 the average per member premium increase reflects a shift in the mix in our fullyinsured group membership from large groups to individuals and small groups as large groups continue to move to an administrative services only offering average per member premiums are lower for individuals and small groups than large groups

the government segment’s benefits ratio for 2006 was 850 a 190 basis point increase from 2005 of 831 the increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of the standalone pdps in january 2006 with a benefits ratio of 925 for 2006 the standalone pdp benefits ratio was negatively impacted by a benefits ratio in our complete plan of 1159 for 2006 one of three standalone pdp offerings representing approximately 12 of our standalone pdp members 

the commercial segment’s benefit expenses decreased 3823 million or 71 from 2005 to 2006 this decrease primarily results from the decrease in fullyinsured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs the increase in average per member claims costs for fullyinsured group members was approximately 6 for 2006 

the benefits ratio for the commercial segment of 817 in 2006 decreased 160 basis points from the 2005 benefits ratio of 833 higher benefit expenses from hurricane katrina increased the 2005 benefits ratio 30 basis points the decrease in the benefits ratio primarily reflects improving medical cost utilization trends and an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fullyinsured block individual and smaller group accounts generally carry a lower benefits ratio than larger group accounts 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 8259 million or 376 during 2006 compared to 2005 the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees and increased sales and marketing costs due to the medicare expansion offset by prior year litigation expenses which did not recur in 2006 the number of employees increased by 3600 to 22300 from 18700 at december 31 2005 primarily in the customer service and marketing functions associated with the growth in the medicare business 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2006 was 143 decreasing 110 basis points from 154 for 2005 expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005 after considering the effects of the litigation settlement the remaining decrease resulted from growth in revenues from higher average medical membership outpacing the related increase in administrative spending on a consolidated basis during 2006 

our government and commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

government segment sga expenses of 17302 million for 2006 increased 7669 million or 796 from 2005 the increase primarily resulted from higher expenses associated with the infrastructure build out of our expanded medicare offerings in the latter half of 2005 through the first half of 2006 as well as increased sales and marketing costs in 2006 also related to the medicare expansion 

the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 90 basis points from 127 for 2005 to 118 for 2006 expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of the litigation the decrease from 2005 to 2006 resulted from average membership and related revenue associated with the medicare expansion reaching the levels contemplated by the now complete buildout of infrastructure and support functions which began in the latter half of 2005 providing more leverage against administrative costs in 2006 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 590 million or 48 during 2006 compared to 2005 the commercial segment sga expense ratio of 200 for 2006 increased 150 basis points from 185 

  

for 2005 expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 60 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of the litigation the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the percentage of small group members comprising our total fullyinsured membership as well as the continued shift in the mix of membership towards aso at december 31 2005 37 of our commercial segment medical membership related to aso business compared to 47 at december 31 2006 small group accounts bear a higher sga ratio than larger group accounts and aso business bears a significantly higher sga ratio than fullyinsured business 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2006 totaled 1486 million compared to 1289 million in 2005 an increase of 197 million or 153 the increase resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the medicare expansion 

interest expense 

interest expense was 631 million for 2006 compared to 393 million for 2005 an increase of 238 million this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt and higher interest rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2006 of 360 increased 97 compared to the 263 effective tax rate for 2005 the higher effective tax rate for 2006 is primarily due to the resolution of a contingent tax gain of 228 million in the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year which did not recur in 2006 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums aso fees investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments sga expenses interest expense taxes purchases of investment securities acquisitions capital expenditures and payments on borrowings because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months in many instances our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing enrollment we have experienced improving operating cash flows associated with growth in medicare enrollment the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital 

cash and cash equivalents increased to 20405 million at december 31 2007 from 17403 million at december 31 2006 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 is summarized as follows 

 

   

cash flow from operating activities 

the decrease in operating cash flows for 2007 resulted from timing of cash flows associated with our medicare part d offerings offset by medicare enrollment growth and improved earnings during 2007 we paid 7255 million to cms under the risk corridor terms of our 2006 contracts with cms similarly the provision for net amounts payable under the risk corridor terms of our 2007 contracts with cms which will be paid in 2008 was 1026 million 

the increase in operating cash flows for 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from medicare enrollment growth improved earnings and the timing of cash flows associated with our medicare part d offerings which were new beginning january 1 2006 our 2006 part d results related to both standalone pdp and mapd offerings reflected provisions for net amounts payable to cms under the risk corridor terms of our contracts with cms this risk corridor amount which was paid in 2007 as discussed above reflects favorable experience on allowable risk corridor costs during the second half of 2006 compared to the expectations set out in our original annual bid for 2006 contracts with cms the favorable experience was associated with the medicare part d portion of our mapd offerings as well as our standard and enhanced standalone plans 

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and aso fees and payments of benefit expenses we illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees the claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the decrease in base receivables from 2006 to 2007 as well as from 2005 to 2006 the 280 million decrease in military services change order receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the collection of receivables in 2006 related to an equitable adjustment to the contract price negotiated in late 2005 for services not originally specified in the contract 

  

despite significant growth in medicare medicare receivables declined 65 million from 2006 to 2007 due to the net collection of receivables associated with the cms risk adjustment model likewise the 773 million increase in medicare receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from an increase in receivables associated with the cms risk adjustment model 

the decline in commercial and other receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the change in the mix of members from fullyinsured to aso 

the 227 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts from 2006 to 2007 resulted from the growth of the medicare business 

the detail of benefits payable was as follows at december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

  

    benefits payable increased during 2007 and 2006 primarily due to growth in medicare membership and to a lesser extent medical claims inflation 

cash flow from investing activities 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows over the last several years in investment securities primarily shortduration fixed income securities totaling 4301 million in 2007 8621 million in 2006 and 2333 million in 2005 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 2392 million in 2007 1932 million in 2006 and 1658 million in 2005 the increased spending in 2007 primarily resulted from the 

  

purchase of three medical centers which were previously leased in south florida in the first quarter of 2007 for approximately 204 million the increased spending in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from our medicare expansion initiatives excluding acquisitions we expect total capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately 275 million 

during 2007 we paid 3691 million to acquire compbenefits 1563 million to acquire kmg and 270 million to acquire defenseweb these amounts include 589 million of cash acquired 

during 2006 we paid 658 million to acquire cha health including 435 million of cash acquired and we paid 58 million to settle the purchase price contingencies associated with prior year acquisitions during 2005 net of cash acquired we paid 4449 million to acquire careplus and 540 million to acquire corphealth these amounts include 961 million of cash acquired 

cash flow from financing activities 

during 2007 our net borrowings of 350 million under our credit agreements related to the financing of the compbenefits and kmg acquisitions during 2006 our borrowings of 550 million and repayments of 300 million under our credit agreements related to the timing of our senior notes issuance and repayment and funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2006 in conjunction with growth in medicare revenues during 2005 we borrowed 494 million under our credit agreement related to the financing of the careplus acquisition a portion of which was repaid in 2005 

during 2006 we issued 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 our net proceeds reduced for the discount and cost of the offering were 4943 million we used the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement which at the time of the issuance was 200 million and the repayment of our 300 million 725 senior notes which matured on august 1 2006 

receipts from cms associated with medicare part d claim subsidies were 1851 million less than the corresponding claim payments during 2007 and 1223 million less than the corresponding claim payments during 2006 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for further description 

the remainder of financing activities in 2007 2006 and 2005 resulted primarily from the change in the securities lending payable proceeds from stock option exercises the tax benefit from stock compensation and the change in the book overdraft the increase in securities lending in 2007 and 2006 coincides with higher average balances of investments to lend and a change in lending terms during 2006 in connection with employee stock plans we acquired common shares totaling 406377 in 2007 467767 in 2006 and 68296 in 2005 for an aggregate cost of 274 million in 2007 262 million in 2006 and 24 million in 2005 on february 21 2008 the board of directors authorized the use of up to 150 million for the repurchase of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans 

senior notes 

we previously issued in the public debt capital markets 300 million aggregate principal amount of 630 senior unsecured notes that mature on august 1 2018 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 645 senior unsecured notes that mature on june 1 2016 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

our 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in july 2011 under the credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the 

  

spread which varies depending on our credit ratings ranges from 27 to 80 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 10 basis points may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points depending upon our credit ratings in addition a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50 of the total 1 billion commitment the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis at our option 

the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth and a maximum leverage ratio the terms of the credit agreement also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect at this time we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to us 

at december 31 2007 we had 800 million of borrowings under the credit agreement outstanding at an interest rate which varies with libor of 530 in addition we have outstanding letters of credit of 20 million secured under the credit agreement no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit as of december 31 2007 we had 1980 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement we have other customary armslength relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement 

other longterm borrowings 

other longterm borrowings of 386 million at december 31 2007 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in the kmg acquisition of 361 million and financing for the renovation of a building of 25 million the junior subordinated debt which is due in 2037 may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 802 payable quarterly until 2012 and then payable at a floating rate based on libor plus 310 basis points the debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 200 is collateralized by the building and is payable in various installments through 2014 

shelf registration 

we have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec which allows us to sell our debt or equity securities from time to time with the amount price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities under the universal shelf registration may be used for our operations and for other general corporate purposes including repayment or refinancing of borrowings working capital capital expenditures investments acquisitions or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements to fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and to refinance debt as it matures 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2007 was baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s and bbb according to standard  poor’s ratings services or sp a downgrade to ba2 or lower by moody’s and bb or lower by sp would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a 300 million notional amount the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap agreement if cancelled we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the 

  

swap agreement assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on december 31 2007 we would have received 183 million net and future net interest payments would increase assuming libor does not change other than the swap agreements adverse changes in our credit ratings do not create increase or accelerate any liabilities 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company increased 1113 million to 5357 million at december 31 2007 compared to 4244 million at december 31 2006 reflecting dividends received net of funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2007 in conjunction with growth in medicare revenues see schedule i to this form 10k beginning on page 107 for our parent company only financial information 

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

based on the most recent statutory financial statements as of december 31 2007 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 29052 million in our state regulated subsidiaries this compares to applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 18105 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level given our anticipated continued premium growth in 2008 capital requirements will increase we expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from humana inc our parent company of approximately 200 million in 2008 

most states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define their required levels of equity discussed above rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by the remaining states and puerto rico at december 31 2007 we would have 9663 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc or individual state requirements based on the most recent statutory financial statements as of december 31 2007 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2007 as follows 

 

  

   

 

   offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2007 we are not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

related parties 

no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 24 2008—see “certain transactions with management and others” 

government contracts 

our medicare business which accounted for approximately 60 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily consisted of products covered under the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan contracts with the federal government these contracts are renewed 

  

generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by august 1 of the year in which the contract would end or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the year in which the contract would end all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare business have been renewed for 2008 

our military business which accounted for approximately 12 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily consisted of the tricare south region contract the 5year south region contract which expires march 31 2009 is subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year at the government’s option effective april 1 2007 the south region contract was extended into the fourth option period which runs from april 1 2007 to march 31 2008 we have received a notice from the government of its intent to renew the fifth option period which runs from april 1 2008 to march 31 2009 the department of defense has the option to extend the current contract for up to six months under existing terms congressional authority has also been granted to extend the contract in one year increments for a maximum of two additional years in the second quarter of 2007 a draft solicitation related to the new tricare contracts currently scheduled to begin april 1 2009 was issued for industry comment currently we are anticipating a formal request for proposal or rfp for the tricare contracts as required under the contract the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for the fourth option period were negotiated any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in october 2007 we were awarded the department of veterans affairs first specialty network demonstration project known as project hero healthcare effectiveness through resource optimization to support healthcare delivery to veterans the contract is comprised of one base period and four oneyear option periods subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with services beginning january 1 2008 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 2 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2007 consisted of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the vast majority in puerto rico our medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration for the east and southeast regions of puerto rico are effective from november 1 2006 through june 30 2008 in 2007 we also entered into an aso contract with the puerto rico health administration for the metro north region which is effective from november 1 2006 through october 31 2009 

the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

benefit expense recognition 

benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows 

 

 military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data this amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government as more fullydescribed on page 45 

estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results of operations and overall financial position accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” as such we expect that substantially all of the december 31 2007 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2008 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels changes in member cost sharing product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a 

  

consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including receipt cycle times claim inventory levels recoveries of overpayments outsourcing system conversions and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years for example the average receipt cycle time has decreased from 165 days in 2005 to 156 days in 2007 which represents a 55 reduction in cycle time over the three year period 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2007 data 

 

  

    

the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable excluding military services components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 

 

 amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development 

as summarized in the previous table claim reserve balances at december 31 2006 ultimately settled during 2007 for 2429 million less than the amounts originally estimated during 2006 claim reserve balances at december 31 2005 ultimately settled for 1790 million less than the amounts originally estimated the 639 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily relates to favorable development experienced in our medicare operations as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions in our medicare operations both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions at december 31 2006 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to changes in estimates associated with our 2006 medicare part d reconciliation and the growth in our medicare business first year medicare part d enrollment and eligibility issues in 2006 led to actual claim settlements with other health plans and states during 2007 for amounts less than originally estimated similar adjustments in the future are not expected to be as significant due to the program’s operational improvement in 2007 

during 2006 claim reserve balances at december 31 2005 ultimately settled during 2006 for 1790 million less than the amounts originally estimated during 2005 claim reserve balances at december 31 2004 ultimately settled for 729 million less than the amounts originally estimated this 1061 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily was attributable to both our medicare and commercial lines of business in each of these lines of business both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions at december 31 2005 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to 1 the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2005 ultimately being lower than estimated 2 the impact of hurricanes in florida and louisiana in the second half of 2005 on both utilization of services and claims processing 3 significant growth in our medicare pffs product 4 reductions in receipt cycle times driven by an increase in electronic claims submissions and 5 an increase in claim overpayment recovery levels versus our historical overpayment recovery rate 

  

benefit expenses associated with the tricare contract and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 future policy benefits payable of 9807 million and 3206 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively represent liabilities for longduration insurance policies including life insurance annuities and health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years these reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest mortality morbidity withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables modified based upon actual experience changes in estimates of these reserves are recognized as an adjustment to benefit expenses in the period the changes occur future policy benefits payable of 2397 million at december 31 2007 and 2427 million at december 31 2006 are subject to 100 coinsurance agreements as more fully described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other longterm assets longduration insurance policies associated with the kmg acquisition increased the balance in future policy benefits payable at december 31 2007 compared to december 31 2006 

as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant an increase in the absolute dollar amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has resulted from the growth in our medicare business coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices when we recognize a release of the redundancy we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business if material we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with cms renew annually our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group an individual or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and members in our medicare and individual products monthly we receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the 

  

federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms changes in revenues from cms for our medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

medicare part d provisions 

on january 1 2006 we began covering prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d under multiple contracts with cms the payments we receive monthly from cms and members which are determined from our annual bid represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage we recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract our cms payment is subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions in addition we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk as described more fully below 

the risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period accordingly this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience we record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or longterm in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement 

the estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain including among others member eligibility differences with cms in 2007 we paid 7255 million related to our reconciliation with cms regarding the 2006 medicare part d risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of 7387 million at december 31 2006 2006 marked the first year of providing for the risk corridor estimate and required us to consider factors which were not certain including certain first year implementation issues the net liability associated with the 2007 risk corridor estimate which will be settled in 2008 was 1026 million at december 31 2007 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for cms’s portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and related settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year we account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize premium revenues or benefit expense for these subsidies receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period gross financing receipts were 28662 million and gross financing withdrawals were 30512 million during 2007 cms subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2007 was 5804 million to other current assets and 2730 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 

in order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage cms provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage or coverage beyond cms’s defined standard benefits the demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which cms pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the 

  

government’s portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage the capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer we chose the demonstration payment option for all of our enhanced benefit plans this capitation amount derived from our annual bid submissions is recorded as premium revenue the variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 6 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program 

medicare risk adjustment provisions 

cms has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs as more fully described in item 1—business on page 5 under this risk adjustment methodology diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us we collect capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms we do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our standalone pdp members 

cms has transitioned to the risk adjustment model while the old demographic model was phased out the demographic model based the monthly premiums paid to health plans on factors such as age sex and disability status the monthly premium amount for each member is separately determined under both the risk adjustment and demographic model these separate payment amounts are then blended according to the transition schedule cms transitioned to the risk adjustment model for medicare advantage plans as follows 30 in 2004 50 in 2005 75 in 2006 and 100 in 2007 the standalone pdp payment methodology is based 100 on the risk adjustment model as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment model as well as budget neutrality as described in item 1—business on page 5 our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

military services 

in 2007 military services revenues represented 12 of total premiums and administrative services fees military services revenue primarily is derived from our tricare south region contract with the department of defense and in addition beginning january 1 2008 from our contract with the department of veterans affairs revenues associated with our contract with the department of veterans affairs are recognized in the period services are performed the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative services fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment disease management and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

the tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target health care cost 

  

amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses we continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

the military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 46504 million or 36 of total assets at december 31 2007 debt securities totaled 46391 million or nearly 100 of this investment portfolio more than 98 of our debt securities were of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2007 most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end bb or better of the noninvestment grade spectrum we have minimal exposure to subprime mortgages as we acceded to approximately 8 million of subprime and secondlien mortgages with our acquisition of kmg in the fourth quarter of 2007 however by the end of january 2008 we had reduced that amount to approximately 4 million of subprime mortgages each of which have maintained at least an aa rating after subsequent reviews by the rating agencies there are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 39 years at december 31 2007 given that short term interest rates were higher than long term rates during most of 2007 cash was invested in cash equivalents instead of longer duration investment securities including cash equivalents the average duration was approximately 26 years based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 172 million 

our investment securities which consist primarily of debt securities have been categorized as available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value fair value of actively traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices fair value of inactively traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices of identical or similar securities or based on observable inputs like interest rates fair value of privately held debt securities including venture capital investments are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies where an observable quoted market does not exist such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows investment securities available for current operations are classified as current assets unrealized holding gains and losses net of applicable deferred taxes are included as a component of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income until realized from a sale or other than temporary impairment 

  

gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at december 31 2007 

 

 we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment we consider factors affecting the issuer factors affecting the industry the issuer operates within and general debt and equity market trends we consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value the severity of the decline the near term prospects for recovery to cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment 

unrealized losses at december 31 2007 resulted from 472 positions out of a total of 1165 positions held approximately 14 of the carrying value of our investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year of these investment securities in an unrealized loss position longer than a year approximately 99 of the carrying value are within 5 of recovering fair value up to cost the unrealized losses at december 31 2007 primarily were caused by increases in interest rates all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities after taking into account these and other factors including the severity of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and as such no impairment was required 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2007 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 20 of total assets and 63 of total stockholders’ equity 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas 142 requires that we test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments which comprise our reportable commercial and government segments 

  

the government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs and includes three lines of business medicare military and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we used a range of discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital key assumptions including changes in membership premium yields medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no impairment losses in the last three years see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the shortterm duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 

we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our debt position as of december 31 2007 and 2006 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including among others unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio shifts in the asset mix between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points four times and have changed by less than 100 basis points five times libor was 470 at december 31 2007

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits including wellness programs to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month we refer to beneficiaries enrolled in these plans collectively as medicare advantage or mapd members with each of these products the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of traditional medicare typically including reduced cost sharing enhanced prescription drug benefits care coordination data mining techniques to help identify member needs complex case management tools to guide members in their health care decisions disease management programs wellness and prevention programs and a reduced monthly part b premium since 2006 medicare beneficiaries have had more health plan options including a prescription drug benefit option and greater access to a ppo offering with the rollout of regional ppo plans prior to 2006 ppo plans were offered on a local basis only most medicare advantage plans must offer the prescription drug benefit under part d as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations accordingly all of the provisions of the medicare part d program described in connection with our standalone prescription drug plans in the following section are also applicable to our medicare advantage plans medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in many cases these beneficiaries also may be required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

our medicare pffs plans have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical medicare advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at reimbursement rates equivalent to traditional medicare payment rates 

cms uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans these rates are adjusted under cms’s risk adjustment model which uses health status indicators or risk scores to improve the accuracy of payment the risk adjustment model which cms implemented pursuant to the balanced budget act of 1997 bba and the benefits and improvement protection act of 2000 bipa uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms has transitioned to this riskbased reimbursement model while the old reimbursement model based on demographic data including gender age and disability status was phased out in 2006 the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 75 from 50 in 2005 the phasein of risk adjusted payment has increased to 100 in 2007 under the risk adjustment methodology all health benefit organizations must capture collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

commensurate with phasein of the riskadjustment methodology payments to medicare advantage plans were increased by a “budget neutrality” factor the budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced during the transition from the previous reimbursement model based upon average original medicare feeforservice spending to the riskadjustment payment model the payment adjustments for budget neutrality were first developed in 2002 and first used with the 2003 payments 

the budget neutrality adjustment began phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by 2011 this does not mean however that the aggregate permember payments to medicare plans will be reduced as plans enroll less healthy beneficiaries the need for the budget neutrality adjustment declines as the underlying risk adjusted medicare rates paid to plans increase to account for their enrollees’ greater healthcare needs as a result of changes in the cms payment processes including the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology and the phasing out of the budget neutrality adjustment described previously our cms payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

  

at december 31 2006 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 1002600 mapd members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 85 billion or 403 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 under our medicare advantage contracts with cms in florida we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 324600 members these contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately 35 billion which represented approximately 412 of our medicare advantage premium revenues or 166 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 

our hmo pffs and ppo products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the contract year or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 

medicare standalone prescription drug products 

on january 1 2006 we began offering standalone prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d generally medicareeligible individuals enroll in one of our three plan choices between november 15 and december 31 for coverage that begins january 1 the enrollment period was extended to may 31 during 2006 because it was the first year of the program our standalone pdp offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by congress as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance our revenues from cms and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to cms these revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described beginning on page 55 our standalone pdp contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the contract year or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 

medicare presence 

we now have a national presence offering our medicare pffs and standalone pdp products in all 50 states the following table sets forth the number of markets in which we sold our medicare advantage and standalone pdp products as of january 1 2007 as compared with january 1 2006 and 2005 

 

 in addition we market our hmo and pffs products in puerto rico as well as our standalone pdp products in the district of columbia and puerto rico 

medicaid product 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services primarily to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a state specific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to 

  

enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 25 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 consisted of contracts in puerto rico and florida with the puerto rico contract representing 752 of total medicaid premiums and aso fees 

tricare 

tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in an hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers similar to a ppo 

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the united states department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 29 million eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2006 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense of these eligible beneficiaries 12 million were tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries seniors over the age of 65 and beneficiaries in puerto rico for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit the tricare south region contract is for a fiveyear period subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with the fourth option period scheduled to begin april 1 2007 we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract 

the tricare south region contract contains provisions that require us to negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government as such events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

for the year ended december 31 2006 tricare premium revenues were approximately 25 billion or 121 of our total premiums and aso fees and tricare aso fees totaled 480 million or 02 of our total premiums and aso fees 

our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members 

consumerchoice products 

over the last several years we have developed and offered various commercial products designed to provide options and choices to employers that are annually facing substantial premium increases driven by doubledigit medical cost inflation these consumerchoice products which can be offered on either a fully insured or aso basis provided coverage to approximately 437900 members at december 31 2006 representing approximately 133 of our total commercial medical membership as detailed below 

 

   

these products are often offered to employer groups as “bundles” where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the employer 

paramount to our consumerchoice product strategy we have developed a group of innovative consumer products styled as “smart” products that we believe will be a longterm solution for employers we believe this new generation of products provides more 1 choices for the individual consumer 2 transparency of provider costs and 3 benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions including the tradeoffs between higher premiums and pointofservice costs at the time consumers choose their plans and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans we believe that when consumers can make informed choices about the cost and effectiveness of their health care a sustainable long term solution for employers can be realized smart products which accounted for approximately 63 of enrollment in all of our consumerchoice plans as of december 31 2006 are only sold to employers who use humana as their sole health insurance carrier 

some employers have selected other types of consumerchoice products such as 1 a product with a high deductible 2 a catastrophic coverage plan or 3 ones that offer a spending account option in conjunction with more traditional medical coverage or as a stand alone plan unlike our smart products these products while valuable in helping employers deal with nearterm cost increases by shifting costs to employees are not considered by us to be longterm comprehensive solutions to the employers’ cost dilemma although we view them as an important interim step 

hmo 

our commercial hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include among others hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan 

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers together with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician we participate in the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp primarily with our hmo offering in certain markets fehbp is the government’s health insurance program for federal employees retirees former employees family members and spouses for the year ended december 31 2006 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 20 billion or 96 of our total premiums and aso fees 

ppo 

our commercial ppo products which are marketed primarily to employer groups and individuals include some types of wellness and utilization management programs however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees 

  

as part of our ppo products we offer humanaone a major medical product marketed directly to individuals we offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels this individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses 

for the year ended december 31 2006 employer and individual commercial ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 37 billion or 174 of our total premiums and aso fees 

aso 

in addition to fully insured consumerchoice hmo and ppo products we also offer aso products to employers who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo hmo or consumerchoice products described previously under aso contracts selffunded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits however most aso customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs for the year ended december 31 2006 commercial aso fees totaled 2918 million or 14 of our total premiums and aso fees 

specialty products 

we additionally offer various specialty products including dental life and shortterm disability at december 31 2006 we had approximately 19 million specialty members including 15 million dental members for the year ended december 31 2006 specialty product premium revenues were approximately 4110 million or 20 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2006 by market and product 

 

 provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities we have approximately 809000 contracts with health care providers participating in our networks which consist of approximately 539800 physicians 5300 hospitals and 263900 ancillary providers and dentists these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs the 

  

focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met our hospitalist programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation indexes outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice generally ranging from 90 to 120 days to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

capitation 

for 24 of our december 31 2006 medical membership we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio or mer ranging from 82 to 89 mer measures underwriting profitability and is computed by taking total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

for another 48 of our december 31 2006 medical membership we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2006 and 2005 

 

 capitation expense as a percentage of total medical expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

   

accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate hmos based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or jcaho 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of applicable quality information committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commissionutilization review accreditation commission or aahcurac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo accreditation specific to the utilization review process also is required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management and member rights and responsibilities we have achieved and maintained ncqa accreditation in all of our commercial hmo markets except puerto rico and in select ppo markets 

aahcurac performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management we continue to maintain urac accreditation in select markets and certain operations 

humana has also pursued iso 90012000 certification over the past several years iso is the international standards organization which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process called iso 90012000 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our medicare medicaid and commercial products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2006 we employed approximately 1700 sales representatives who are each paid a salary and per member commission to market our medicare and medicaid products in the united states and puerto rico we employed approximately 600 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members we also market our medicare products via a strategic alliance with walmart stores inc or walmart this alliance includes stationing humana representatives in certain walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person in addition we market our medicare products through licensed independent brokers and agents including strategic alliances with state farm ® and usaa we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums including bonuses based on sales volume 

  

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we also offer commercial health insurance products directly to individuals 

at december 31 2006 we used licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 700 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to a commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents based on other metrics these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

risk management 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare tricare or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described on page 17 in item 1a—risk factors 

government regulation 

federal regulation 

government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules the passing of the medicare modernization act of 2003 or mma represents the most sweeping changes to medicare since the bba changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results also it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 

  

state and local regulation 

we are also subject to substantial regulation by the states in which we do business we regularly are audited and subject to various enforcement actions by state departments of insurance these departments enforce laws relating to all aspects of our operations including benefit offerings marketing claim payments subsidiary capital requirements and premium setting especially with regard to our small group business although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties and other sanctions against us including exclusion from participation in government programs we do not believe the results of any of these actions individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

pending federal and state legislation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives continue at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

for a complete description of all of the current activities in the federal and state legislative areas see item 1a—risk factors on page 22 

other 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses in an effort to minimize credit risk we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings over the past few years we have reduced the amount of coverage purchased from thirdparty insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain based on the financial strength and liquidity of our captive insurance subsidiary 

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance human resources accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 22300 employees including 31 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages

 item 1a risk factors tableend this document includes both historical and forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements are made within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 we intend such forwardlooking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events trends and uncertainties these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things the information discussed below in making these statements we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results our business is highly complicated regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 

if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate our profitability could decline 

we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record medical claims reserves for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively our membership and profitability could decline 

we are in a highly competitive industry some of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program and in consumerchoice health plans such as high deductible health plans with hsas we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs the commercial pricing environment particularly in the 2 to 300 member groups is extremely competitive we believe some of our competitors including public and notforprofit companies are pricing aggressively to gain market share 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationship with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract including our tricare contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives including our medicare initiatives our business could be materially adversely affected 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the mma the mma offers new opportunities in our medicare programs including our hmo ppo and pffs medicare advantage products as well as our standalone pdp products we have made substantial additional investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs over the last few years we have increased the size of our medicare geographic reach since the enactment of the mma through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage in addition to our other product offerings we have been approved to offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 50 states as well as puerto rico and the district of columbia the growth in our medicare membership and revenues impacts the pattern of our quarterly earnings including the timing of membership enrollment and the speed with which the individual members meet their deductibles and costsharing provisions 

we have also made substantial investments in the service personnel and technology necessary to administer the growing medicare business we continue to work with cms to devise solutions to certain cms systems issues that have created some difficulty receiving correct information about eligibility of certain low income persons in the part d program 

  

the growth of our medicare business is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the medicare business which are described elsewhere in this document these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business with emphasis on our aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including our smart consumerchoice products such as hsas as well as the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents and other stakeholders through webenabling technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

  

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions results of operations and cash flows 

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare tricare and medicaid programs our government segment accounted for approximately 70 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 and we expect the government segment to account for a greater percentage of our total premiums and aso fees in 2007 these programs involve various risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 the premiums from cms are subject to risk corridor provisions which compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment settlement based upon pharmacy claims experience the estimate of the settlement associated with these risk corridor provisions which is not expected to be applied against the rigors of a final settlement with cms until mid2007 requires us to consider factors that may not be certain these factors include some first year implementation issues such as member eligibility differences with cms as well as interpretations of cms operational guidance beginning in 2008 the risk corridor thresholds increase which means we will bear more risk our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net liability of 7387 million at december 31 2006 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for cms’s portion of claims costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 6 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program our claims data may not pass cms’s claims edit processes due to various reasons including but not limited to discrepancies in eligibility or classification of lowincome members to the extent our data does not pass cms’s claim edit processes we may bear the risk for all or a portion of the claim which otherwise may have been subject to the risk corridor provision or reimbursement as a lowincome or 

  

reinsurance claim in addition in the event the settlement represents an amount cms owes us there is a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of financing cms’s share of the risk the opposite is true in the event the settlement represents an amount we owe cms 

 

  

  

  

 our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 

the health care industry in general and health insurance particularly hmos and ppos are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

as of december 31 2006 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 20660 million in our state regulated subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 14303 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level given our anticipated continued premium growth in 2007 capital requirements will increase we expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from humana inc our parent company in the range of 325 million to 425 million in 2007 

most states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define their required levels of equity discussed above rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by the remaining states and puerto rico at december 31 2006 each of our subsidiaries would be in substantial compliance and we would have 5162 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc or individual state requirements 

the use of individually identifiable health data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 

  

the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules could subject us to significant criminal and civil penalties including significant monetary penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates a business associate is a person or entity other than a member of the work force who on behalf of a covered entity performs or assists in the performance of a function or activity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information or provides legal accounting consulting data aggregation management administrative accreditation or financial services 

laws in each of the states including puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including the scope of benefits rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators our licensed subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations 

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance our hmos are audited for compliance with health services by state departments of health audits and investigations are also conducted by state attorneys general cms the office of the inspector general of health and human services the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor the defense contract audit agency and state departments of insurance and departments of health several state attorneys general and departments of insurance are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers including some of those used by certain companies in the health care industry all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs or the imposition of fines penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

other areas subject to substantial regulation include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 there are two areas of legislation that can impact the company that are experiencing an increase in legislative activity these two areas are medicare funding under mma and proposals to expand health insurance coverage mma funding and associated program structure is an area of substantial legislative attention that may be influenced by federal budget considerations and medicare spending trends the second area of increased activity is federal and state efforts to expand access to health coverage these proposals may offer opportunities to serve individuals who are not currently in the health insurance market through public program expansions coverage connectors or premium assistance programs some access proposals also include increased regulation of our commercial business particularly small group and individual through a combination of benefit mandates underwriting restrictions rating limitations and assessments 

  

state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 all of these proposals could apply to us and could result in new regulations that increase the cost of our operations 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect entry into new markets our revenues or the number of our members increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 

any failure to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability while we proactively attempt to effectively manage such expenses increases in staffrelated expenses investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products acquisitions and implementation of regulatory requirements among others may occur from time to time 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership and this may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

  

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physician specialty groups physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

our recently implemented mail order pharmacy business subjects us to additional regulations in addition to those we face with our core health benefits businesses 

we have opened a mail order pharmacy business that subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products and the application of state laws related to the operation of internet and mailservices pharmacies the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pharmacy subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

downgrades in our debt ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating 

  

agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such downgrades in our ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend our current and past business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and other state and federal regulatory authorities these authorities regularly scrutinize the business practices of health insurance and benefits companies these reviews focus on numerous facets of our business including claims payment practices competitive practices commission payments privacy issues utilization management practices and sales practices some of these reviews have historically resulted in fines imposed on us and some have required changes to some of our practices we continue to be subject to these reviews which could result in additional fines or other sanctions being imposed on us or additional changes in some of our practices 

we also are involved in various lawsuits that arise for the most part in the ordinary course of our business operations including employment litigation claims of medical malpractice bad faith nonacceptance or termination of providers anticompetitive practices improper rate setting failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements intellectual property matters and challenges to subrogation practices we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers members and others including failure to properly pay claims challenges to our implementation of the new medicare prescription drug program and other litigation 

personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted in addition insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the outcome of current suits or likelihood or outcome of future suits or governmental investigations cannot be accurately predicted with certainty and therefore such legal actions and government audits and investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

overview 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies based on our 2006 revenues of 214 billion we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and consumerchoice plans for governmentsponsored programs employer groups and individuals as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 113 million members in our medical benefit programs as well as approximately 19 million members in our specialty products programs 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicare tricare and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes two lines of business medical fully and self insured and specialty we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of sfas 131  which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we believe our customer membership revenue and pretax income diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success 

we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  or sfas 123r on january 1 2006 we have adjusted prior period amounts to reflect the effect of expensing stock awards under the modified retrospective application method of sfas 123r as discussed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

our results are impacted by many factors but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive 

  

premium aso fee and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures increasing capacity and supply of medical services new prescription drugs and therapies an aging population lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking the tort liability system and government regulations 

our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance mer which is computed by taking total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability the sga expense ratio which is computed by taking total selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

government segment 

our strategy and commitment to the expanded medicare programs including new product choices and pharmacy benefits for seniors led to substantial growth during 2006 medicare advantage membership increased to 1002600 members at december 31 2006 up 797 from 557800 members at december 31 2005 primarily due to sales of our pffs product our new medicare standalone pdp products added 3536600 members during 2006 medicare premium revenues more than doubled to 115 billion during 2006 primarily as a result of this membership growth 

pretax earnings in the government segment of 5138 million in 2006 were 62 higher than 2005 this increase resulted primarily from the membership and associated revenue growth in our medicare advantage plans partially offset by results for the new medicare standalone pdp offerings our complete standalone pdp offering one of three standalone pdp offerings representing 12 of our standalone pdp membership operated at a loss with a mer of 116 in 2006 the reason for the operating loss primarily related to the product’s design including covering brand name prescription drugs in the coverage gap the coverage gap represents the stage of coverage where the member would be responsible for the cost under a standard plan the complete standalone pdp offering was redesigned for 2007 

in addition the new standalone pdp benefit designs impacted our quarterly earnings pattern these benefit designs result in coverage that varies as a member’s cumulative outofpocket costs pass through successive stages of a member’s plan period as specified under the standard plan defined by cms these plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages of a member’s plan period and less in the later stages for the plans which comprise the majority of our membership this generally produces results that improve as the year progresses for example during 2006 our standard and enhanced standalone pdp offerings resulted in an mer of 977 during the first quarter improving to 747 during the fourth quarter 

commercial segment 

commercial segment medical membership increased 113000 members or 36 from december 31 2005 to 3283800 at december 31 2006 as a result of the may 1 2006 cha acquisition which added 88400 members and higher aso individual and consumerchoice membership partially offset by a decline in our fully insured group membership aso membership at december 31 2006 was up 31 from december 31 2005 individual membership increased 15 and consumerchoice membership increased 13 during 2006 these three areas together with our small group business now represent more than 84 of our commercial medical membership 

other highlights 

 

   

  

  

  

 we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements 

2005 settlement of class action litigation 

on october 17 2005 we reached an agreement with representatives of more than 700000 physicians to settle a nationwide class action suit in connection with the settlement and other related litigation costs we recorded pretax administrative expenses of 719 million 448 million after taxes or 027 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2005 of the 719 million 334 million was included in the government segment results and the remaining 385 million was included in the commercial segment results these amounts were paid in 2006 

2005 hurricane katrina 

certain of our operations primarily the louisiana market were negatively affected by the impact of hurricane katrina in august 2005 expenses related to hurricane katrina primarily stemmed from our efforts in cooperation with departments of insurance in the affected states to help our members by offering participatingprovider benefits at nonparticipating providers’ rates paying claims for members who were unable at the time to meet their premium obligations and similar measures in connection with hurricane katrina we recorded pretax medical and administrative expenses of 270 million 169 million after taxes or 010 per diluted common share during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 of the 270 million 59 million was included in the government segment results and the remaining 211 million was included in the commercial segment results 

recent acquisitions 

on may 1 2006 our commercial segment acquired cha service company or cha health a health plan serving employer groups in kentucky for cash consideration of 675 million including a 17 million contingent purchase price settlement paid in january 2007 this acquisition strengthens our position in the kentucky market the acquisition of cha health added approximately 60100 fully insured group members and 28300 aso members to our commercial segment medical membership this transaction did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations for 2006 

  

on december 20 2005 our commercial segment acquired corphealth inc a behavioral health care management company for cash consideration of approximately 540 million this acquisition allows humana to integrate coverage of medical and behavior health benefits 

on february 16 2005 we acquired careplus health plans of florida or careplus as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately 4449 million in cash adding approximately 50400 medicare advantage members in miamidade broward and palm beach counties this acquisition enhances our medicare market position in south florida 

on april 1 2004 we acquired ochsner health plan or ochsner from the ochsner clinic foundation for 1571 million in cash ochsner a louisiana health plan added approximately 152600 commercial medical members primarily in fully insured large group accounts and approximately 33100 members in the medicare advantage program 

during 2006 we paid 58 million in contingent purchase price settlements related to the corphealth careplus and ochsner acquisitions 

these transactions are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement 109  or fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize measure present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return fin 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive annual tabular rollforward of the unrecognized tax benefits fin 48 which became effective for us beginning january 1 2007 requires the change in net assets that results from the application of the new accounting model to be reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings the adoption of fin 48 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  or sfas 158 we adopted sfas 158 prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2006 for the year ending december 31 2006 sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income sfas 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position and revises certain disclosure requirements the benefit obligation is defined as the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and as the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for any other postretirement benefit plan such as a retiree health care plan the adoption of sfas 158 did not have a material impact on our financial position 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements or sfas 157 sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require new fair value measurements we are required to adopt sfas 157 in the first quarter of 2008 we currently are evaluating the provisions of sfas 157 however we do not expect the adoption of sfas 157 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 this table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages 

summary 

net income was 4874 million or 290 per diluted common share in 2006 compared to 2967 million or 179 per diluted common share in 2005 net income for 2005 included expenses resulting from the physician class action settlement 448 million after taxes or 027 per diluted common share and costs associated with hurricane katrina 169 million after taxes or 010 per diluted common share described previously net income for 2005 also included the beneficial effect of an effective tax rate of approximately 263 compared to 360 in 2006 primarily due to the resolution of a contingent gain 228 million or 014 per diluted common share during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year after considering litigation and hurricane katrina expenses and the favorable tax gain contingency in 2005 the remaining year over year improvement in 2006 results from earnings increases in both the government and commercial segments 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership premium revenues increased 480 to 207 billion for 2006 compared to 140 billion for 2005 higher government segment premium revenues were partially offset by a decrease in commercial segment premium revenues premium revenues reflect higher enrollment in our medicare advantage plans and the addition of our standalone pdp business 

government segment premium revenues increased 71 billion or 936 to 146 billion for 2006 compared to 75 billion for 2005 this increase primarily was attributable to the expanded participation in various medicare products and geographic markets sales of our pffs products drove the majority of the 797 

  

increase in medicare advantage members since december 31 2005 at december 31 2006 approximately 47 of the company’s medicare advantage members were in pffs plans versus 22 at december 31 2005 additionally our new medicare standalone pdp products added 3536600 members and 31 billion in new premium revenues during 2006 medicaid membership increased 111200 members from december 31 2005 due primarily to the award of a new puerto rico regional aso contract in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by eligible puerto rico medicaid members choosing to move into the medicare program 

commercial segment premium revenues decreased 53 to 61 billion for 2006 compared to 65 billion for 2005 lower premium revenues primarily resulted from a reduction of fully insured membership our fully insured membership decreased 123 or 245600 members to 1754200 at december 31 2006 compared to 1999800 at december 31 2005 primarily as a result of continued attrition within the fully insured group accounts partially offset by membership gains from the cha acquisition and membership increases in the individual and consumerchoice product lines attrition in the fully insured group accounts results from a competitive pricing environment average per member premiums for our fully insured group medical members increased approximately 57 from 2005 to 2006 the average per member premium increase reflects a shift in the mix in our fully insured group membership from large groups to individuals and small groups as large groups continue to move to an administrative services only offering average per member premiums are lower for individuals and small groups than large groups 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees for 2006 were 3412 million an increase of 818 million or 315 from 2594 million for 2005 the increase was due to increases in our commercial segment administrative services fees 

for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 824 million or 394 from 2094 million for 2005 to 2918 million for 2006 this increase resulted from increased membership aso membership of 1171000 members at december 31 2005 increased 306 to 1529600 at december 31 2006 average per member fees increased approximately 19 in 2006 aso fees from our commercial segment represent 86 of total aso fees 

investment income 

investment income totaled 2919 million for 2006 an increase of 1489 million from 1430 million for 2005 the increase in investment income for 2006 primarily resulted from higher venture capital gains and higher average invested balances and interest rates investment income for 2006 includes 757 million in net realized gains related to venture capital investments compared to 57 million in 2005 

other revenue 

other revenue totaled 543 million for 2006 an increase of 402 million from 141 million for 2005 the increase primarily was attributable to revenue from our new inhouse mail order pharmacy operations in 2006 

medical expense 

consolidated medical expense was 174 billion for 2006 an increase of 57 billion or 487 from 117 billion for 2005 the increase was primarily driven by the increase in the number of members particularly higher cost medicare members and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation 

the consolidated mer for 2006 was 840 an 80 basis point increase from 832 for 2005 higher medical expenses from hurricane katrina increased the 2005 mer 20 basis points an improvement in the commercial segment mer was more than offset by a higher government segment mer impacted by the new medicare standalone pdp offerings 

  

the government segment’s medical expenses increased 62 billion or 981 during 2006 compared to 2005 the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of medicare members including those enrolled in our standalone pdps 

the government segment’s mer for 2006 was 850 a 190 basis point increase from 2005 of 831 the increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of the standalone pdps in january 2006 with an mer of 925 for 2006 the standalone pdp mer was negatively impacted by an mer in our complete plan of 1159 for 2006 one of three standalone pdp offerings representing approximately 12 of our standalone pdp members we expect mer to improve in 2007 to approximately 82 to 84 for our combined medicare advantage and standalone pdp offerings 

the commercial segment’s medical expenses decreased 3823 million or 71 from 2005 to 2006 this decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs the increase in average per member claims costs for fully insured group members was approximately 6 for 2006 and is expected to range from 5 to 6 for 2007 

the mer for the commercial segment of 817 in 2006 decreased 160 basis points from 2005 mer of 833 higher medical expenses from hurricane katrina increased the 2005 mer 30 basis points the decrease in mer primarily reflects improving medical cost utilization trends and an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fully insured block individual and smaller group accounts generally carry a lower mer than larger group accounts 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 8259 million or 376 during 2006 compared to 2005 the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees and increased sales and marketing costs due to the medicare expansion offset by prior year litigation expenses which did not recur in 2006 the number of employees increased by 3600 to 22300 from 18700 at december 31 2005 primarily in the customer service and marketing functions associated with the growth in the medicare business 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2006 was 143 decreasing 110 basis points from 154 for 2005 expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005 after considering the effects of the litigation settlement the remaining decrease resulted from growth in revenues from higher average medical membership outpacing the related increase in administrative spending on a consolidated basis during 2006 

our government and commercial segments bear direct and indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

government segment sga expenses of 17302 million for 2006 increased 7669 million or 796 from 2005 the increase primarily resulted from higher expenses associated with the infrastructure build out of our expanded medicare offerings in the latter half of 2005 through the first half of 2006 as well as increased sales and marketing costs in 2006 also related to the medicare expansion 

the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 90 basis points from 127 for 2005 to 118 for 2006 expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of the litigation the decrease from 2005 to 2006 resulted from average membership and related revenue associated with the medicare expansion reaching the levels contemplated by the now complete buildout of infrastructure and support functions which began in the latter half of 2005 providing more leverage against administrative costs in 2006 

  

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 590 million or 48 during 2006 compared to 2005 the commercial segment sga expense ratio of 202 for 2006 increased 170 basis points from 185 for 2005 expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 60 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of the litigation the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the percentage of small group members comprising our total fully insured membership as well as the continued shift in the mix of membership towards aso at december 31 2005 37 of our commercial segment medical membership related to aso business compared to 47 at december 31 2006 small group accounts bear a higher sga ratio than larger group accounts and aso business bears a significantly higher sga ratio than fully insured business 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2006 totaled 1486 million compared to 1289 million in 2005 an increase of 197 million or 153 the increase resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the medicare expansion 

interest expense 

interest expense was 631 million for 2006 compared to 393 million for 2005 an increase of 238 million this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt and higher interest rates 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2006 of 360 increased 97 compared to the 263 effective tax rate for 2005 the higher effective tax rate for 2006 is primarily due to the resolution of a contingent tax gain of 228 million in the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year which did not recur in 2006 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate we expect the 2007 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36 to 37

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2005 and 2004 

 

 this table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages 

summary 

net income was 2967 million or 179 per diluted common share in 2005 compared to 2699 million or 166 per diluted common share in 2004 the increase in net income primarily resulted from improved profits in our government segment driven by gains in medicare advantage membership and improved pretax results in both our medicare advantage and tricare operations 

net income for 2005 included expenses resulting from the class action litigation settlement 448 million after taxes or 027 per diluted common share and costs associated with hurricane katrina 169 million after taxes or 010 per diluted common share net income for 2005 also included the favorable effect of an effective tax rate of approximately 263 compared to 324 in 2004 primarily due to the resolution of a contingent tax gain 228 million or 014 per diluted common share during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 103 to 140 billion for 2005 compared to 127 billion for 2004 higher government segment premium revenues were partially offset by a decrease in commercial segment premium revenues 

government segment premium revenues increased 318 to 75 billion for 2005 compared to 57 billion for 2004 this increase primarily was attributable to our medicare advantage operations and the effects of transitioning to the tricare south region contract during 2004 medicare advantage membership was 557800 at december 31 2005 compared to 377200 at december 31 2004 an increase of 180600 members or 479 this increase was due to expanded participation in various medicare advantage programs and geographic markets as well as the careplus acquisition the february 16 2005 careplus acquisition added 50400 members and 4863 million in premium revenues in 2005 average per member premiums for our medicare advantage business increased approximately 12 during 2005 this reflects a shift in our medicare advantage membership mix to higher reimbursement markets due primarily to the south florida careplus acquisition tricare premium revenues increased 132 in 2005 reflecting the transition to the new south region contract during 2004 which included a temporary loss of approximately 1 million members for 4 months in 2004 medicaid membership declined by 20700 members from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 

  

primarily due to the fact that we did not renew our participation in the medicaid program for the state of illinois on july 31 2005 the illinois medicaid business was not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

commercial segment premium revenues decreased 73 to 65 billion for 2005 compared to 70 billion for 2004 lower premium revenues primarily resulted from a reduction of fully insured membership partially offset by increases in average per member premiums our fully insured membership decreased 125 or 286700 members to 1999800 at december 31 2005 compared to 2286500 at december 31 2004 the decrease is primarily due to the relinquishment of an 89000member unprofitable account on january 1 2005 and continued attrition due to the ongoing competitive environment within the fully insured group accounts partially offset by membership gains in the individual and consumerchoice product lines average per member premiums for our fully insured group medical members increased approximately 74 in 2005 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees for 2005 were 2594 million a decrease of 134 million or 49 from 2728 million for 2004 

administrative services fees for the government segment decreased 567 million or 531 from 1068 million for 2004 to 501 million for 2005 this decline resulted from the transition to the new south region contract which carved out certain government programs including the administration of pharmacy and medical benefits to senior members over the age of 65 we transitioned services under these separate programs to other providers during 2004 

for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 434 million or 261 from 1660 million for 2004 to 2094 million for 2005 this increase resulted from increased membership and higher average per member fees aso membership of 1171000 members at december 31 2005 increased 150 compared to 1018600 at december 31 2004 average per member fees increased approximately 8 in 2005 

investment income 

investment income totaled 1430 million in 2005 an increase of 102 million from 1328 million in 2004 this increase primarily was attributable to higher interest rates and average invested balances offset by lower capital gains net realized capital gains of 183 million in 2005 decreased 99 million from 282 million in 2004 as of december 31 2005 we had an unrealized gain of 523 million related to a venture capital investment which was realized in the first quarter of 2006 

medical expense 

consolidated medical expenses increased 9818 million or 92 during 2005 the increase was primarily driven by the increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation and incremental medical expenses related to the careplus acquisition 

the consolidated mer for 2005 was 832 decreasing 90 basis points from 841 for 2004 due to improvements in both the commercial and government segments as further discussed below the 2005 consolidated mer includes 20 basis points for expenses associated with hurricane katrina 

the government segment’s medical expenses increased 14 billion or 300 during 2005 primarily due to the increase in average per member claims costs and the increase in the number of medicare advantage members including those related to the careplus acquisition the increase in average per member claims costs for medicare advantage approximated 8 to 10 during 2005 

the government segment’s mer for 2005 was 831 a 120 basis point decrease from the 2004 rate of 843 excluding a 10 basis point increase in the 2005 mer from hurricane katrina the decrease was primarily 

  

attributable to the increase in medicare advantage revenues as a percentage of total government segment revenues and average per member medicare advantage premiums outpacing average per member medicare advantage claim costs 

the commercial segment’s medical expenses decreased 4652 million or 80 this decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs the increase in average per member claims costs for fully insured group members was approximately 7 to 9 for 2005 

the mer for the commercial segment of 833 in 2005 decreased 60 basis points from the 2004 mer of 839 higher medical expenses from hurricane katrina increased the 2005 mer 30 basis points after considering the effect of hurricane katrina the decrease in mer for the 2005 period primarily reflects the absence of the unprofitable 89000member large group account that lapsed on january 1 2005 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 3013 million or 159 during 2005 primarily resulting from an increase in the number of employees due to the medicare expansion the class action litigation settlement and increased advertising and marketing costs also due to the medicare expansion these increases were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses associated with transitioning to the tricare south region contract in 2004 during 2005 the number of employees increased 5000 to 18700 at december 31 2005 primarily in the sales and customer service functions associated with the growth in the medicare business as well as approximately 1200 employees added with the careplus acquisition 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2005 was 154 increasing 80 basis points from 146 for 2004 expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of litigation expenses the sga expense ratio increase primarily resulted from a commercial membership mix shift and increased spending associated with the medicare expansion 

our government and commercial segments bear direct and indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 2481 million or 347 during 2005 due to the careplus acquisition increased spending associated with the medicare expansion and the class action litigation settlement these increases were partially offset by a decrease in tricare expenses from the transition to the south region contract in 2004 the government segment sga expense ratio increased 40 basis points from 123 for 2004 to 127 for 2005 expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 532 million or 45 during 2005 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 200 basis points from 165 for 2004 to 185 for 2005 expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 60 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of litigation expenses this increase resulted from the continued shift in the mix of membership towards aso aso business bears a significantly higher sga ratio than fully insured business 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2005 totaled 1289 million compared to 1178 million for 2004 an increase of 111 million or 94 amortization of other intangible assets increased 133 million during 2005 primarily as a result of intangible assets recorded in connection with the careplus acquisition 

  

interest expense 

interest expense was 393 million for 2005 compared to 232 million for 2004 an increase of 161 million this increase primarily resulted from higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate in 2005 of 263 decreased 61 compared to the 324 effective tax rate in 2004 the effective tax rate for 2005 reflects the favorable impact from the resolution of a contingent tax gain of 228 million during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums aso fees cms settlements investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments sga expenses cms settlements interest expense taxes purchases of investment securities capital expenditures acquisitions and payments on borrowings because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months in many instances our business should normally produce positive cash flows during a period of increasing enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during a period of shrinking enrollment we have recently been experiencing improving operating cash flows associated with growth in medicare enrollment the use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require among other items that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital 

cash and cash equivalents increased to 17403 million at december 31 2006 from 7320 million at december 31 2005 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash flow from operating activities 

the increase in operating cash flows for 2006 resulted from medicare enrollment growth improved earnings and the timing of cash flows associated with our new medicare part d offerings our part d results related to both standalone pdp and mapd offerings reflect provisions for net amounts payable to cms of 7387 million under the risk corridor terms of our contracts with cms this risk corridor amount which is expected to be paid mid2007 reflects favorable experience on allowable risk corridor costs during the second half of 2006 compared to the expectations set out in our original annual bid for 2006 contracts with cms the favorable experience was associated with the medicare part d portion of our mapd offerings as well as our standard and enhanced standalone plans 

comparisons of our operating cash flows between 2005 and 2004 were significantly impacted by the timing of the medicare premium remittance which is payable to us on the first day of each month when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday we historically received this payment at the end of the previous month as such the medicare receipt for january 2004 of 2119 million was received in december 2003 because january 1 is a holiday 

  

beginning in 2005 the monthly premium payment schedule included a change in timing from previous practice this new practice made an exception to the holiday rule for the january 1 payment although january 1 always represents a holiday the new practice results in the january 1 payment being received on the first business day of january as a result of this change the january 2005 payment of 2903 million originally scheduled to be received on friday december 31 2004 was changed to monday january 3 2005 or one business day later therefore we received 12 monthly medicare premium remittances in 2006 and 2005 compared to only 11 in 2004 

in addition to the impact from the timing of the medicare premium receipts higher earnings and medicare enrollment growth contributed to increased operating cash flows in 2005 and 2004 

comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and aso fees and payments of medical expenses we illustrate these changes with the following summary of receivables and medical and other expenses payable 

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 tricare base receivables consist of estimated amounts owed from the federal government for claims incurred including claims incurred but not reported or ibnr and underwriting fees the claim reimbursement component of tricare base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the 569 million decrease in base receivables resulted primarily from a timing difference in our claim reimbursements partially offset by an increase in underwriting fee receivables 

the increase in tricare base receivables from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to the transition to the reimbursement model under the south region contract beginning on august 1 2004 and higher claims inventories at our third party claims processing vendor the transition to the south region contract had the effect of increasing the tricare base receivable and a corresponding increase in tricare claims payable 

the 280 million decrease in tricare change order receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the collection of receivables in 2006 related to an equitable adjustment to the contract price negotiated in late 2005 for services not originally specified in the contract 

  

the 773 million increase in medicare receivables in 2006 resulted from the growth in medicare membership while the 642 million increase in 2005 was due to an increase in receivables associated with cms’s risk adjustment model 

the decline in commercial and other receivables since december 31 2004 results from the change in the mix of members from fully insured to aso 

the detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

     medical and other expenses payable primarily increased during 2006 due growth in medicare membership and to a lesser extent medical claims inflation 

medical and other expenses payable primarily increased during 2005 due to 1 growth in medicare membership 2 medical claims inflation 3 the transition to the new south region contract 4 an increase in the tricare payable resulting from an increase in claims inventory at our third party claims processing vendor as discussed under the total net receivables table on the previous page and 5 an increase in the capitation payable to physicians under risk sharing arrangements 

cash flow from investing activities 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows over the last several years in investment securities primarily shortduration fixed income securities totaling 8621 million in 2006 2333 million in 2005 and 4073 million in 2004 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 1932 million 

  

in 2006 1658 million in 2005 and 1141 million in 2004 the increased spending in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from our medicare expansion initiatives excluding acquisitions we expect total capital expenditures in 2007 of approximately 200 million 

during 2006 we paid 223 million to acquire cha health net of 435 million of cash acquired and we paid 58 million in contingent purchase price settlements related to prior years acquisitions during 2005 we paid 3528 million to acquire careplus net of 921 million of cash acquired and we paid 500 million to acquire corphealth net of 40 million of cash acquired during 2004 we paid 1418 million to acquire ochsner net of 153 million of cash acquired 

during 2004 proceeds of 305 million from the sale of property and equipment relate primarily to consolidating our service centers in jacksonville and san antonio including the sale of the jacksonville office tower in 2004 for 148 million 

cash flow from financing activities 

during 2006 we issued 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 our net proceeds reduced for the discount and cost of the offering were 4943 million we used the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement which at the time of the issuance was 200 million and the repayment of our 300 million 725 senior notes which matured on august 1 2006 

during 2006 our borrowings of 550 million and repayments of 300 million under our credit agreements related to the timing of our senior notes issuance and repayment and funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2006 in conjunction with growth in medicare revenues during 2005 we borrowed 494 million under our 5year 600 million credit agreement this amount included 294 million which we borrowed temporarily to finance the careplus acquisition and repaid in 2005 

subsidies from cms associated with medicare part d claims for which we do not assume risk were 1223 million less than the claim payments as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

the remainder of financing activities in 2006 2005 and 2004 resulted primarily from the change in the securities lending payable proceeds from stock option exercises tax benefits of stockbased compensation and the change in the book overdraft the increase in securities lending in 2006 coincides with a change in banking vendors and higher average balances of investments to lend in connection with employee stock plans we acquired common shares totaling 467767 in 2006 and 68296 in 2005 for an aggregate cost of 262 million in 2006 and 24 million in 2005 in 2004 we repurchased 36 million common shares in open market transactions and 02 million common shares in connection with employee stock plans for 670 million at an average price of 1783 per share the board of directors’ authorization for open market transactions expired in january 2005 

senior notes 

in may 2006 we issued 500 million of 645 senior notes due june 1 2016 as discussed previously we paid 300 million when our 725 senior notes matured on august 1 2006 our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

on july 14 2006 we replaced our existing 5year 600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement with a 5year 10 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement we entered into the credit agreement for general corporate purposes under the credit agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance 

  

basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the spread which varies depending on our credit ratings ranges from 27 to 80 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 10 basis points may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points depending upon our credit ratings in addition a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50 of the total 1 billion commitment the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis at our option 

the credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth and a maximum leverage ratio the terms of the credit agreement also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect at this time we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to us 

at december 31 2006 we had 450 million of borrowings under the credit agreement outstanding at an interest rate of 573 in addition we have outstanding letters of credit of 34 million secured under the credit agreement no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit as of december 31 2006 we had 5466 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement we have other relationships including financial advisory and banking with some parties to the credit agreement 

other longterm borrowings 

other longterm borrowings of 31 million at december 31 2006 represent financing for the renovation of a building bear interest at 2 per annum are collateralized by the building and are payable in various installments through 2014 

shelf registration 

on march 31 2006 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec we are considered a “well known seasoned issuer” under the securities offering reform act that became effective in december 2005 the universal shelf registration allows us to sell our debt or equity securities from time to time with the amount price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities under the universal shelf registration may be used for our operations and for other general corporate purposes including repayment or refinancing of borrowings working capital capital expenditures investments acquisitions or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements to fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and to refinance debt as it matures 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2006 was baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s and bbb according to standard  poor’s ratings services or sp a downgrade to ba2 or lower by moody’s and bb or lower by sp would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a 300 million notional amount the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap agreement if cancelled we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on december 31 

  

2006 we would have received 61 million net and future net interest payments would increase assuming libor does not change other than the swap agreements adverse changes in our credit ratings do not create increase or accelerate any liabilities 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company increased 48 million to 4244 million at december 31 2006 compared to 4196 million at december 31 2005 reflecting funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2006 in conjunction with growth in medicare revenues offset by additional borrowings in 2006 see schedule i to this form 10k beginning on page 106 for our parent company only financial information 

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

as of december 31 2006 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 20660 million in our state regulated subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 14303 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level given our anticipated continued premium growth in 2007 capital requirements will increase we expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from humana inc our parent company in the range of 325 million to 425 million in 2007 

most states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define their required levels of equity discussed above rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by the remaining states and puerto rico at december 31 2006 each of our subsidiaries would be in substantial compliance and we would have 5162 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc or individual state requirements 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2006 as follows 

 

    

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2006 we are not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

our operating lease of an airplane which expires january 1 2010 provides for a residual value payment of no more than 48 million at the end of the lease term at the end of the term we have the right to exercise a purchase option for 89 million or the airplane can be sold to a third party the residual value payment will be reduced by the net sales proceeds in excess of 42 million from the sale of the airplane to a third party 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our tricare subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

related parties 

no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 26 2007—see “certain transactions with management and others” 

government contracts 

our medicare business which accounted for approximately 55 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily consisted of products covered under the medicare advantage and standalone pdp contracts with the federal government these contracts are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the contract year or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year all material contracts between humana and cms relating to our medicare business have been renewed for 2007 

  

our tricare business which accounted for approximately 12 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily consisted of the south region contract the 5year south region contract is subject to annual renewals on april 1 of each year at the government’s option effective april 1 2006 the south region contract was extended into the third option period which runs from april 1 2006 to march 31 2007 we have received a notice from the government of its intent to renew the fourth option period the 5year south region contract expires march 31 2009 as required under the contract the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for the third option period were negotiated any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government accordingly events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military deployments in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 3 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 consisted of contracts in puerto rico and florida our medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration accounted for approximately 2 of our total premium and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2006 we currently are operating under the terms of our contracts that expired october 31 2006 due to several ongoing and unresolved issues with the program the government of puerto rico has decided to delay the bid process for new contracts we currently are working with the puerto rico health insurance administration regarding terms and rates which is expected to result in an extension of the existing contracts through september 30 2007 there is no assurance that the puerto rico health insurance administration will request such an extension and we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that any government policy or fiscal decisions might have on the continuation of our medicaid contracts in puerto rico 

the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

legal proceedings 

we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business including employment matters breach of contract actions tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” of item 3 in part 1 we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters in addition recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

medical expense recognition 

medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows 

 

 estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results of operations and overall financial position accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” as such we expect that substantially all of the december 31 2006 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2007 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim experience depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation changes in claim processes including receipt cycle times inventories recoveries of overpayments outsourcing system conversions and disruptions due to weather affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors the receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years for example the average number of receipt cycle time days has decreased from 165 days in 2005 to 159 days in 2006 which represents a 36 reduction in cycle time 

  

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the portion of ibnr estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of ibnr estimated using trend factors the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on december 31 2006 data 

 

   ibnr established in connection with our tricare contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than for our other operations because there are more variables that impact the estimate these additional variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions many of these variables are impacted by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the united states armed forces we have considered all of these factors in establishing our ibnr estimate each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

as more fully described on page 57 our tricare contract contains risksharing provisions with the department of defense and with subcontractors which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid as a result of these contract provisions the impact of changes in estimates for prior year tricare medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially whether positive or negative 

  

as more fully described on pages 11 and 12 we have a significant percentage of our medicare and medicaid membership under risksharing arrangements with providers accordingly the impact of changes in estimates for prior year medical claims payable on our results of operations that are attributable to our medicare and medicaid lines of business may also be significantly reduced whether positive or negative 

the following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our medical and other expense payable components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated medical expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals 

 

 amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development 

as summarized in the previous table claim reserve balances at december 31 2005 ultimately settled during 2006 for 2755 million less than the amounts originally estimated during 2005 claim reserve balances at december 31 2004 ultimately settled for 1142 million less than the amounts originally estimated this 1613 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2006 as compared to 2005 consisted of 1062 million attributable to our medicare and commercial lines of business as well as 551 million attributable to our tricare line of business amounts attributable to our tricare line of business are discussed separately due to the additional variability and risk sharing provisions with the department of defense and subcontractors as previously described our key assumptions consist of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions in our medicare and commercial operations both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions at december 31 2005 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to 1 the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2005 ultimately being lower than estimated 2 the impact of hurricanes in florida and louisiana in the second half of 2005 on both utilization of services and claims processing 3 significant growth in our medicare pffs product 4 reductions in receipt cycle times driven by an increase in electronic claims submissions and 5 an increase in claim overpayment recovery levels versus our historical overpayment recovery rate in our tricare line of business both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2005 ultimately being lower than estimated changes in claim payment patterns resulting from fluctuations in claim inventory levels and an increase in claim overpayment recovery levels versus our historical overpayment recovery rate 

during 2004 claim reserve balances at december 31 2003 ultimately settled during 2004 for 935 million less than the amounts originally estimated the 207 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2005 as compared to 2004 consisted of 163 million attributable to our tricare line of business and 

  

44 million attributable to our medicare and commercial lines of business in each of these lines of business our trend factor assumptions at december 31 2004 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2004 ultimately being lower than originally estimated 

as previously discussed our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience which generally results in favorable reserve development or reserves that are considered redundant an increase in the absolute dollar amount of redundancy over the last three years has resulted from the growth in our business coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices when we recognize a release of the redundancy we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business if material we believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for medical and other expenses payable 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear contracts with commercial employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our medicare contracts with the federal government renew annually while our medicaid and tricare contracts with state and federal governments respectively are generally multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 

our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage our medicare and medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member however our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section 

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group an individual or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on available data and historical trends we monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium and aso fee remittances from employer groups the federal and state governments and individual members monthly premium and aso fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 

medicare part d provisions 

on january 1 2006 we began covering prescription drug benefits in accordance with medicare part d under multiple contracts with cms the payments we receive monthly from cms and members which are determined from our annual bid represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage we recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract our cms payment is subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions in addition we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk as described more fully below 

the risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by cms variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received we estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues 

  

related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period accordingly this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience we record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or longterm in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement 

the estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions which is not expected to be applied against the rigors of a final settlement with cms until mid2007 requires us to consider factors that may not be certain these factors include some first year implementation issues such as member eligibility differences with cms as well as interpretations of cms operational guidance our estimate of the settlement associated with the medicare part d risk corridor provisions was a net liability of 7387 million at december 31 2006 

reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms in connection with the medicare part d program for which we assume no risk reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for cms’s portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member’s outofpocket threshold or the catastrophic coverage level lowincome cost subsidies represent reimbursements from cms for all or a portion of the deductible the coinsurance and copayment amounts above the outofpocket threshold for lowincome beneficiaries monthly prospective payments from cms for reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid a reconciliation and related settlement of cms’s prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year we account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not recognize premium revenues or claims expense for these subsidies receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period gross financing receipts were 20025 million and gross financing withdrawals were 21247 million during 2006 cms subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 was 4500 million to other current assets and 3277 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 

in order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage cms provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage or coverage beyond cms’s defined standard benefits the demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which cms pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the government’s portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage the capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer we chose the demonstration payment option for all of our enhanced benefit plans this capitation amount derived from our annual bid submissions is recorded as premium revenue the variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement 

settlement of the reinsurance and lowincome cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 6 months after the close of each calendar year this reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for cms to administer the program 

medicare risk adjustment provisions 

cms has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs as more fully described on page 5 under this risk adjustment methodology diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us we collect capture and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms we do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our standalone pdp members 

  

cms has transitioned to the risk adjustment model while the old demographic model was phased out the demographic model based the monthly premiums paid to health plans on factors such as age sex and disability status the monthly premium amount for each member is separately determined under both the risk adjustment and demographic model these separate payment amounts are then blended according to the transition schedule cms transitioned to the risk adjustment model for medicare advantage plans as follows 30 in 2004 50 in 2005 75 in 2006 and 100 in 2007 the standalone pdp payment methodology is based 100 on the risk adjustment model as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment model as well as budget neutrality as described on page 5 our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

tricare contract 

in 2006 tricare revenues represented 12 of total premiums and administrative services fees the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 aso fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment disease management and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health care services are provided administrative service fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

the tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target health care cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in medical expenses we continually review these medical expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

the tricare contract contains provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 36072 million or 36 of total assets at december 31 2006 debt securities totaled 35983 million or 99 of this investment portfolio more than 97 of our debt securities were of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2006 most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end bb or better of the noninvestment grade spectrum our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

  

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 33 years at december 31 2006 given that short term interest rates were higher than long term rates during most of 2006 cash was invested in cash equivalents instead of longer duration investment securities including cash equivalents the average duration lowers to 22 years based on the duration including cash equivalents a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately 117 million 

our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices nontraded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately held are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies where an observable quoted market price does not exist such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows unrealized holding gains and losses net of applicable deferred taxes are included as a component of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income until realized from a sale or impairment 

gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december 31 2006 included the following 

 

 we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment we consider factors affecting the issuer factors affecting the industry the issuer operates within and general debt and equity market trends we consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below cost the severity of the decline the near term prospects for recovery to cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment 

unrealized losses at december 31 2006 resulted from 425 positions out of a total of 758 positions held approximately 30 of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year of these investment securities in an unrealized loss position longer than a 

  

year approximately 97 are within 5 of recovering fair value up to cost no single issue was below cost by more than 15 the unrealized losses at december 31 2006 primarily were caused by increases in interest rates all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities after taking into account these and other factors including the severity of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and as such no impairment was required 

there were impairment losses of 02 million in 2006 and none in 2005 or 2004 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2006 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 19 of total assets and 64 of total stockholders’ equity 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we not amortize goodwill to earnings but instead that we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments the commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of medical fully and self insured and specialty the government segment’s three reporting units consist of medicare tricare and medicaid goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness we used a range of discount rates that correspond to a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital key assumptions including changes in membership premium yields medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets there were no impairment losses in 2006 or 2005 we recognized losses due to accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of 93 million in 2004 see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the level of our pretax earnings is subject to market risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the shortterm duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 

we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our investment portfolio and our debt position as of december 31 2006 and 2005 our investment portfolio consists of cash cash equivalents and investment securities the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including among others unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio shifts in the asset mix between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points once have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points three times and have changed by less than 100 basis points six times libor was 536 at december 31 2006

 item 1 business tableend general 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc referred to throughout this document as “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “humana” is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies based on our 2005 revenues of 144 billion we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internetbased plans for employer groups governmentsponsored programs and individuals as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 71 million members in our medical insurance programs as well as approximately 19 million members in our specialty products programs we have approximately 559000 contracts with physicians hospitals dentists and other providers to provide health care to our members during 2005 51 of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government including 17 related to our tricare contracts and 20 related to our contracts in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms under our cms contracts in florida we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 295400 members as of december 31 2005 

we were organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 and the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see item 1a—risk factors for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results or business 

business segments 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicare advantage tricare and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines of business fully insured medical administrative services only or aso and specialty we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information or sfas 131 which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we believe our customer membership revenue and pretax income diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success 

  

our products 

the following table presents our segment membership premiums and aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

  our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries 

medicare advantage products 

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance cms an agency of the united states department of health and human services administers the medicare program 

we contract with cms under the medicare advantage program to provide health insurance benefits to medicare eligible persons under health maintenance organization or hmo preferred provider organization or ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms usually a fixed payment per member per month with each of these products the beneficiary generally receives benefits in excess of traditional medicare typically including a prescription drug benefit a reduced monthly part b premium or reduced cost sharing beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries have more health plan options including a prescription drug benefit option and greater access to a ppo offering with the rollout of regional 

  

ppo plans prior to 2006 ppo plans were offered on a local basis only most medicare advantage plans must offer the prescription drug benefit as part of the basic plan subject to cost sharing and other limitations medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits 

our medicare hmo and ppo plans which cover medicareeligible individuals residing in certain counties may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in many cases these beneficiaries also may be required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

our medicare pffs plans which cover eligible medicare beneficiaries in certain states have no preferred network individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive enhanced prescription drug benefits and have the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at reimbursement rates equivalent to traditional medicare payment rates 

medicare uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to managed care plans in the last decade congress has made several changes to how cms must calculate these rates the old pre1998 methodology was based on the adjusted average per capita cost methodology or aapcc under aapcc cms projected average countylevel feeforservice spending for the coming year to set the fixed monthly payments for medicare health plans at 95 percent of the full aapcc amount 

under the aapcc system payment rates per county varied widely for example the 1997 payment rate for beneficiaries 65 and older for part a and part b services ranged from a low of 22092 in arthur county nebraska to a high of 76735 in richmond county staten island new york some states saw differences of more than 20 percent between adjacent counties since county feeforservice costs were used to estimate county managed care payment rates the rates reflected differences among counties and regions in feeforservice utilization patterns and cost structures 

in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba congress created a new ratesetting methodology eliminating the direct link in the aapcc method between managed care rates and local feeforservice costs as a result the wide disparities in county payment rates were reduced bringing all payment rates closer to the national average 

additionally the bba required cms to implement a risk adjustment payment system for medicare health plans risk adjustment uses health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries cms initially phasedin this payment methodology with a risk adjustment model that based payment on principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as demographic factors such as gender age and medicaid eligibility from 2000 to 2003 risk adjusted payment accounted for only 10 percent of medicare health plans payment with the remaining 90 percent being based on demographic factors 

pursuant to the benefits and improvements protection act of 2000 bipa cms implemented a new risk adjustment model that uses additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms has also redesigned its data collection and processing system to further reduce administrative data burden on medicare health plans in 2005 the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 50 percent from 30 percent in 2004 the phasein of risk adjusted payment will be increased to 75 in 2006 and to 100 in 2007 under the new risk adjustment methodology all managed care organizations must capture collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms within prescribed deadlines 

commensurate with phasein of the new riskadjustment methodology payments to medicare advantage plans have been increased by a “budget neutrality” factor the budget neutrality factor was implemented to prevent overall health plan payments from being reduced during the transition to the new riskadjustment 

  

payment model the payment adjustments for budget neutrality were first developed in 2002 and began to be used with the 2003 payments 

the budget neutrality adjustment will begin phasing out in 2007 and will be fully eliminated by 2011 this does not mean however that the aggregate permember payments to medicare plans will be reduced as plans enroll less healthy beneficiaries the need for the budget neutrality adjustment declines as the underlying risk adjusted medicare rates paid to plans increase to account for their enrollees’ greater healthcare needs as a result of changes in the cms payment processes including the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology and the phasing out of the budget neutrality adjustment described previously our cms payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

at december 31 2005 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 557800 medicare advantage members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 46 billion or 322 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 under our contracts with cms in florida we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 295400 members these contracts accounted for premium revenues of approximately 28 billion which represented approximately 609 of our medicare advantage premium revenues or 199 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the contract year or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 

medicare prescription drug products 

on january 1 2006 we began covering members in prescription drug plans or pdps under medicare part d for 2006 coverage medicareeligible individuals may enroll between november 15 2005 and may 15 2006 in one of our three plan choices these three plan choices standard enhanced and complete may vary in terms of coverage levels and outofpocket costs for premiums deductibles and coinsurance with the standard plan offering the minimum benefits mandated by congress our bid amount generally represents the payment we receive from cms however this payment is subject to adjustments and subsidies in order for humana and cms to share the risk associated with financing the ultimate cost of the health benefit further the amount of the payment we receive from cms is subject to the risk adjustment payment process previously described in order to take into account beneficiaries’ health status risk factors unlike our medicare advantage products there is no phasein of the risk adjustment payment process for our pdp products our pdp products covered under medicare part d contracts with cms are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the contract year or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 

medicare presence 

the following table sets forth the number of markets in which we sold our medicare advantage and pdp products as of january 1 2006 as compared with january 1 2005 and 2004 

 

 in addition we are marketing our hmo and pffs products in puerto rico for coverage beginning january 1 2006 

  

medicaid product 

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a state specific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 38 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 consisted of contracts in puerto rico florida and illinois our 3year medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration which accounted for approximately 28 of our total premium and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 were extended a fourth year and these contracts expire on june 30 2006 we are preparing to bid on the new contracts that will be effective july 2006 although a request for such proposal has not yet been issued by the puerto rico health insurance administration at this time we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that any government policy decisions might have on our medicaid contracts in puerto rico 

our other current medicaid contract which is in florida is scheduled to expire on june 30 2006 due to medicaid reform in florida we are currently negotiating the terms and rates for the renewal contract we expect the current contract to be extended until august 31 2006 and the subsequent renewal contract to be effective for a twoyear term beginning september 1 2006 due to continual decreases in the reimbursement from the state of illinois we exited the illinois medicaid market effective july 31 2005 the illinois and florida medicaid contracts accounted for approximately 10 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 

tricare 

tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in an hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers 

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the united states department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 29 million eligible beneficiaries as of december 31 2005 in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense of these eligible beneficiaries 11 million were tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries seniors over the age of 65 and beneficiaries in puerto rico for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit the tricare south region contract is for a fiveyear period subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with the third option period scheduled to begin april 1 2006 we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract 

the tricare south region contract contains provisions that require us to negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government as such events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care 

  

cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military presence around the world in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

during 2004 we completed a contractual transition of our tricare business on july 1 2004 our regions 2 and 5 contract servicing approximately 11 million tricare members became part of the new north region which was awarded to another contractor on august 1 2004 our regions 3 and 4 contract became part of our new south region contract on november 1 2004 the region 6 contract with approximately 1 million members became part of the south region contract the members added with the region 6 contract essentially offset the members lost four months earlier with the expiration of our regions 2 and 5 contract for the year ended december 31 2005 tricare premium revenues were approximately 24 billion or 169 of our total premiums and aso fees 

part of the tricare transition during 2004 included the carve out of the tricare senior pharmacy and tricare for life program which we previously administered on as aso basis on june 1 2004 and august 1 2004 administrative services under these programs were transferred to another contractor for the year ended december 31 2005 tricare administrative services fees totaled 501 million or 04 of our total premiums and aso fees 

our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members 

consumerchoice products 

over the last several years we have developed and offered various commercial products designed to provide options and choices to employers that are annually facing substantial premium increases driven by doubledigit medical cost inflation these consumerchoice products which can be offered on either a fully insured or aso basis provided coverage to approximately 371100 members at december 31 2005 representing approximately 117 of our total commercial medical membership as detailed below 

 

 these products are often offered to employer groups as “bundles” where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the employer 

paramount to our consumerchoice product strategy we have developed a group of innovative consumer products styled as “smart” products that we believe will be a longterm solution for employers we believe this new generation of products provides more 1 choices for the individual consumer 2 transparency of provider costs and 3 benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions including the tradeoffs between higher premiums and pointofservice costs at the time consumers choose their plans and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans we believe that when consumers can make informed choices about the cost and effectiveness of their health care a sustainable long term solution for employers can be realized smart products which accounted for approximately 651 of enrollment in all of our consumerchoice plans as of december 31 2005 only are sold to employers who use humana as their sole health insurance carrier 

  

some employers have selected other types of consumerchoice products such as 1 a product with a high deductible 2 a catastrophic coverage plan or 3 ones that offer a spending account option in conjunction with more traditional medical coverage or as a stand alone plan unlike our smart products these products while valuable in helping employers deal with nearterm cost increases by shifting costs to employees are not considered by us to be longterm comprehensive solutions to the employers’ cost dilemma although we view this as an important initial interim step 

hmo 

our hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include among others hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan 

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers together with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician we participate in the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp primarily with our hmo offering in certain markets fehbp is the government’s health insurance program for federal employees retirees former employees family members and former spouses for the year ended december 31 2005 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 24 billion or 171 of our total premiums and aso fees 

ppo 

our ppo products which are marketed primarily to commercial groups and individuals include some elements of managed health care however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees 

as part of our ppo products we offer humanaone a major medical product marketed directly to individuals we offer this product in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels this individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage 

for the year ended december 31 2005 commercial and individual ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 36 billion or 255 of our total premiums and aso fees 

administrative services only 

we also offer aso products to employers who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo hmo or consumerchoice products described above under aso contracts selffunded employers 

  

retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits however most aso customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs for the year ended december 31 2005 commercial aso fees totaled 2094 million or 14 of our total premiums and aso fees 

specialty products 

we additionally offer various specialty products including dental group and individual life and shortterm disability at december 31 2005 we had approximately 19 million specialty members including 15 million dental members for the year ended december 31 2005 specialty product premium revenues were approximately 3867 million or 27 of our total premiums and aso fees 

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2005 by market and product 

 

 provider arrangements 

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities we have approximately 559000 contracts with health care providers participating in our networks which consist of approximately 336300 physicians 3600 hospitals and 219100 ancillary providers and dentists these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

  

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract with us provides services to our members and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of quality patient care are met our hospitalist programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

capitation 

for 44 of our december 31 2005 medical membership we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from 82 to 89 providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

for 78 of our december 31 2005 medical membership we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2005 and 2004 

 

 capitation expense as a percentage of total medical expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 accreditation assessment 

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs including those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate hmos based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

  

physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or jcaho 

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical licenses review of their malpractice liability claims histories review of their board certifications if applicable and review of any complaints including member appeals and grievances committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commissionutilization review accreditation commission or aahcurac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo accreditation specific to the utilization review process also is required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by a thirdparty labor agreement or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management and member rights and responsibilities we continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through ncqa 

aahcurac performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management we continue to maintain urac accreditation in select markets and certain operations 

humana has also pursued iso 90012000 certification over the past several years iso is the international standards organization which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process called iso 90012000 

sales and marketing 

we use various methods to market our medicare medicaid and commercial products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings 

at december 31 2005 we employed approximately 1700 sales representatives who are each paid a salary andor per member commission and used approximately 62900 licensed independent brokers and agents to market our medicare and medicaid products in the continental united states and puerto rico we also employed approximately 500 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members during 2005 we expanded the number of ways we market our medicare products including among others strategic alliances with walmart stores inc or walmart state farm ®  and usaa the alliance with walmart includes stationing humana representatives in the walmart stores sam’s club locations and neighborhood markets across the country providing an opportunity to enroll medicare eligible individuals in person 

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of their employees or members we also offer commercial health insurance products to individuals 

at december 31 2005 we used approximately 51300 licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 700 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular 

  

customers we also have programs that pay brokers and agents on other bases these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commissions based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

risk management 

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with our medicare tricare or medicaid products because government regulations require us to accept all eligible applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 

competition 

the health benefits industry is highly competitive our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers may be influenced by such factors as those described on page 18 in item 1a—risk factors 

government regulation 

government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules the passing of the medicare modernization act of 2003 or mma represents the most sweeping changes to medicare since the bba changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results also it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 

federal regulation 

medicare 

the mma made many significant changes to the medicare feeforservice and medicare advantage programs as well as other changes to the commercial health insurance marketplace most significantly the mma created a voluntary prescription drug benefit called “part d” benefit for medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2006 established a new medicare advantage program to replace the medicarechoice program and enacted taxadvantaged health savings accounts or hsas for nonmedicare eligible individuals and groups see the description of our medicare products beginning on page 4 for additional discussion 

cms conducts audits of plans qualified under its medicare program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations these audits include review of the plans’ administration and management including management information and data collection systems fiscal stability utilization management and physician incentive arrangements health services delivery quality assurance marketing enrollment and disenrollment activity claims processing and complaint systems 

  

cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements in addition cms requires certain disclosures to cms and to medicare beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan contracted under the medicare program cms’s rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between the plan and physicians in the plan’s networks these rules also require certain levels of stop loss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses relating to patient care depending on the amount of financial risk they assume the reporting of certain health care data contained in hedis is another important cms disclosure requirement 

fraud and abuse laws 

enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation’s law enforcement entities the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare medicaid and the fehbp we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs the programs are subject to very technical rules when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 

federal hmo act 

of our nine licensed and active hmo subsidiaries as of february 1 2006 eight are qualified under the federal health maintenance organization act of 1973 as amended to obtain federal qualification an hmo must meet certain requirements including conformance with benefit rating and financial reporting standards federal qualification allows us to participate in the fehbp program in certain markets and for certain products we operate hmos that are not federally qualified because this provides greater flexibility with respect to product design and pricing than is possible for federally qualified hmos 

privacy regulations 

the use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data violations of these rules could subject us to significant penalties 

state and local regulation 

we are also subject to substantial regulation by the states in which we do business we regularly are audited and subject to various enforcement actions by state departments of insurance these departments enforce laws relating to all aspects of our operations including benefit offerings marketing claim payments and premium setting especially with regard to our small group business although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties and other sanctions against us including exclusion from participation in government programs we do not believe the results of any of these actions individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a medicaid product and by the puerto rico health insurance administration in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies the reviews are similar in nature to those performed by cms 

  

laws in each of the states including puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including the scope of benefits rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance and our hmos are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health most states’ laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years 

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus for additional information regarding our regulated subsidiaries’ statutory capital requirements see page 22 in item 1a—risk factors 

audits and investigations 

we are subject to various governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions as more fully described on page 24 in item 1a—risk factors 

pending federal and state legislation 

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives continue at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

other 

captive insurance company 

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain certain of these risks through our whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to these risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses in an effort to minimize credit risk we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings since january 1 2003 we have reduced the amount of coverage purchased from thirdparty insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain based on the financial strength and liquidity of our captive insurance subsidiary we provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities as well as a rollforward of reserve activity related to our captive insurance subsidiary in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

  

centralized management services 

we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans and both of our business segments from our headquarters and service centers these services include management information systems product development and administration finance personnel development accounting law public relations marketing insurance purchasing risk management internal audit actuarial underwriting claims processing and customer service 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 18700 employees including 19 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe we have good relations with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend this document includes both historical and forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements are made within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 we intend such forwardlooking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events trends and uncertainties these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things the information discussed below in making these statements we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results our business is highly complicated regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 

if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate our profitability could decline 

we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record medical claims reserves for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and used to set our premiums these factors may include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively our membership and profitability could decline 

we are in a highly competitive industry many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry in terms of a larger market share and have greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare program and in consumerchoice health plans such as high deductible health plans with hsas we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs the commercial pricing environment particularly in the 2 to 300 member groups is extremely competitive several of our competitors including public and notforprofit companies are pricing aggressively to gain market share 

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationship with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include our possible exit from or entrance into medicare or commercial markets or the termination of a large contract including our tricare contract 

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect if membership declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives our business could be materially adversely affected 

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future this strategy includes opportunities created by the mma the mma offers new opportunities in our medicare programs including our hmo ppo and pffs medicare advantage 

  

products as well as our pdp products we have made substantial additional investments in the medicare program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs we have doubled the size of our medicare geographic reach since the enactment of the mma through expanded medicare product offerings we are offering both the standalone medicare prescription drug coverage pdp and medicare advantage health plan with prescription drug coverage mapd in addition to our other product offerings our medicare presence as of february 1 2006 included more than 700000 medicare advantage members and approximately 17 million pdp members in 12 hmo markets 33 local ppo markets and 35 states in which we have a private feeforservice offering enrollment in the new part d prescription drug plans began on november 15 2005 and the plans became effective january 1 2006 we have been approved to offer the medicare prescription drug plan in 46 states and the district of columbia 

the timing of our new membership enrollment in our medicare advantage and pdp products is an important factor in meeting our business objectives the pattern of quarterly earnings for 2006 is subject to certain assumptions including the timing of when a member enrolls in a plan the plan type the member selects and the speed with which the individual members meet their deductibles and costsharing provisions 

we have also made substantial investments in the service personnel and technology necessary to administer the growing medicare business service issues intensified due to an enormous number of individuals being eligible in the new program on january 1 we have to implement various initiatives such as hiring additional service representatives to address the service issues 

the growth of our medicare business is an important part of our business strategy any failure to achieve this growth may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition the expansion of our medicare business in relation to our other businesses may intensify the risks to us inherent in the medicare business which are described elsewhere in this document these expansion efforts may result in less diversification of our revenue stream 

additionally our strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business with emphasis on our aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including our smart consumerchoice products such as hsas as well as the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position us for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted or adopted in the time periods assumed failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional information systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses 

  

was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences 

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors we have recently changed vendors in our pharmacy benefits program a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

our business plans also include becoming a quality ebusiness organization by enhancing interactions with customers brokers agents and other stakeholders through webenabling technology our strategy includes sales and distribution of health benefit products through the internet and implementation of advanced selfservice capabilities for internal and external stakeholders 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions results of operations and cash flows 

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions and tort claims 

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act rackateer influenced and corrupt organizations act and other statutes may be sought while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of our insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance in some jurisdictions coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” in note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the medicare tricare and medicaid programs our government segment accounted for approximately 53 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 and we expect the government segment to account for a greater percentage of our total premiums and aso fees in 2006 these programs involve various risks including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 

the health care industry in general and health insurance particularly hmos and ppos are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation 

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

as of december 31 2005 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 12032 million in our state regulated subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 7222 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level given our anticipated premium growth in 2006 resulting from the expansion of our medicare products capital requirements will increase we expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from humana inc our parent company in the range of 450 million to 650 million in 2006 

most states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by all states and puerto rico at december 31 2005 we would be required to fund 147 million in one of our puerto rico subsidiaries to meet all requirements after this funding we would have 3782 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 

the use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data the rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 

these regulations set standards for the security of electronic health information violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates a business associate is a person or entity other than a member of the work force who on behalf of a covered entity performs or assists in the performance of a function or activity involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information or provides legal accounting consulting data aggregation management administrative accreditation or financial services 

another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days however due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards procedures and penalties we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices the providersponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties 

we are implementing a mail order pharmacy business that subjects us to extensive federal state and local regulation we are also subject to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 

  

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations these can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general cms the office of the inspector general of health and human services the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor the defense contract audit agency and state departments of insurance and departments of health several state attorneys general and departments of insurance are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers including those of certain of the companies in the health care industry all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs or the imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

other areas subject to substantial regulation include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in recent years significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to 

 

  

  

  

  

 all of these proposals could apply to us and could result in new regulations that increase the cost of our operations 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect entry into new markets our revenues or the number of our members increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 

our ability to manage administrative costs could hamper profitability 

the level of our administrative expenses impacts our profitability while we attempt to manage effectively such expenses increases in staffrelated expenses investment in new products including our opportunities in the medicare programs greater emphasis on small group and individual health insurance products acquisitions and implementation of regulatory requirements among others may occur from time to time 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership that may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

any failure by us to manage acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results business and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives in order to pursue this strategy successfully we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete transactions some of which may be large and complex and manage postclosing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees integration and other risks can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business could be adversely affected 

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members this type of contract is referred to as a “capitation” contract the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

if we fail to manage prescription drug programs successfully our financial results could suffer 

in general prescription drug costs have been rapidly rising over the past few years these increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brandname drugs and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes in order to control prescription drug costs we have 

  

implemented multitiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs including our fourtiered copayment benefit design rx4 and an rx allowance program structured to account for those drugs that treat more pervasive conditions and are suggested to be more effective by empirical data 

we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc our parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium generated a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from our parent company to fund our expanding business opportunities including the enhanced medicare business we anticipate additional required capital ranging from 450 million to 650 million in 2006 in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval in the event that we are unable to provide sufficient capital to fund the obligations of humana inc our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 

ratings are an important factor in our competitive position 

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such downgrades in our ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend managed care industry purported class action litigation 

since 1999 we have been involved in several purported class action lawsuits that were part of a wave of generally similar actions targeting the health care payer industry and particularly managed care companies these included a lawsuit against us and originally nine of our competitors that purported to be brought on behalf of physicians who treated our members since january 1 1990 the plaintiffs asserted that we and other defendants paid providers’ claims incorrectly by paying lesser amounts than they submitted these cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida the “court” and styled in re managed care litigation  

on october 17 2005 we and representatives of over 700000 physicians and several state medical societies reached an agreement “settlement agreement” to settle the lawsuit by payment of 40 million for the physicians and an amount up to 18 million for the plaintiffs’ attorneys subject to approval by the court the settlement agreement recognizes that we have undertaken certain initiatives to facilitate relationships with and payments to physicians and provides for additional initiatives over its fouryear term the court preliminarily approved the settlement agreement on october 19 2005 and set a settlement hearing for march 6 2006 

three other defendants aetna inc cigna corporation and the prudential insurance company of america previously entered into settlement agreements that have been approved by the court health net inc announced a settlement agreement on may 2 2005 and wellpoint inc formerly wellpoint health networks inc and anthem inc announced a settlement agreement on july 11 2005 

  

in connection with the settlement and other related litigation costs we recorded pretax administrative expense of 719 million 448 million after taxes or 027 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2005 

other litigation and proceedings 

in july 2000 the office of the florida attorney general initiated an investigation apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the managed care industry purported class action litigation described above on september 21 2001 the texas attorney general initiated a similar investigation no actions have been filed against us by either state 

in addition our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities there has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the business practices of managed care companies including allegations of anticompetitive and unfair business activities claims payment practices commission payment practices and utilization management practices some of these reviews have resulted in fines imposed on us and required changes in some of our practices we continue to be subject to these reviews which could result in additional fines or other sanctions being imposed on us or additional changes in some of our practices 

we also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations including claims of medical malpractice bad faith nonacceptance or termination of providers improper rate setting failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements as well as challenges to subrogation practices we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers members and others including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 

in addition some courts have issued rulings which make it easier to hold plans liable for medical negligence on the part of network providers on the theory that providers are agents of the plans and that the plans are therefore vicariously liable for the injuries to members by providers 

personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted in addition insurance coverage for all forms of liability has become increasingly costly and coverage for certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

the outcome of current suits or likelihood or outcome of future suits or governmental investigations cannot be accurately predicted with certainty in addition the potential for increased liability for medical negligence arising from claims adjudication along with the increased litigation that has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry adds to this uncertainty therefore such legal actions and government audits and investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

overview 

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies based on our 2005 revenues of 144 billion we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internetbased plans for employer groups governmentsponsored programs and individuals as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 71 million members in our medical insurance programs as well as approximately 19 million members in our specialty products programs 

we manage our business with two segments government and commercial the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicare advantage tricare and medicaid the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines of business fully insured medical aso and specialty we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of sfas 131 which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we believe our customer membership revenue and pretax income diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success 

our results are impacted by many factors but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium aso fee and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces including new higher priced technologies 

  

and medical procedures increasing capacity and supply of medical services new prescription drugs and therapies an aging population lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking the tort liability system and government regulations 

government segment 

in our government segment the passage of the mma in december 2003 demonstrated the federal government’s commitment to providing health benefits and options to seniors by creating new product choices for medicareeligible individuals sold through the private sector these new products include pffs plans and local ppos with coverage effective in 2005 and regional ppos and pdps with coverage effective in 2006 the pffs plans generally offer additional benefits compared to traditional medicare in exchange for a monthly premium paid by the member these plans typically include a prescription drug benefit with no provider network restrictions local and regional ppo plans typically offer an even higher level of benefits to members including a prescription drug benefit and a lower level of member costsharing on many benefits when the member uses medical services from innetwork providers 

as a longtime participant in the medicare program we believe that we possess 1 business competencies and management experience with senior product design 2 a robust and scalable multichannel distribution system 3 an established and competitive network including a national retail pharmacy network and 4 an established brand awareness with seniors accordingly we have developed a strategy to take full advantage of these expanded programs this resulted in significant expenditures and commitments of resources during 2005 including among other items 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our strategy and commitment to these expanded medicare advantage programs has led to substantial growth during 2005 medicare advantage membership increased to 557800 members at december 31 2005 up 479 from 377200 members at december 31 2004 primarily due to sales of our new pffs products and the addition of 50400 members from our acquisition of careplus health plans of florida in february 2005 likewise medicare premium revenues have increased 487 to 46 billion for 2005 from 31 billion in 2004 we expect the medicare line of business to continue to grow during 2006 from continued geographic expansions of our medicare advantage offerings and our new pdp plans as of february 1 2006 medicare advantage membership totaled more than 700000 members and pdp membership totaled approximately 17 million members we expect 2006 medicare premium revenues to more than double from 2005 from sales of our medicare advantage and pdp plans and for selling general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2006 however while our creation of the infrastructure related to our medicare expansion will be nearly completed by the end of the first quarter of 2006 we do not believe the resulting expected revenues and membership will peak until medicare enrollment is completed on july 1 2006 we believe this will result in lower earnings and margins in the first half of 2006 relative to the second half of 2006 when we believe our consolidated revenues will reach the level contemplated by our selling general and administrative expenses 

  

in our tricare business 2005 marked our first full fiscal year under the south region contract after being awarded the south region contract in 2003 we transitioned our tricare business to one of three newlycreated regions under the government’s revised tricare program during 2004 we started the second option year under the south region contract on april 1 2005 

commercial segment 

our strategy to drive commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of a variety of innovative and consumerchoice product designs these products are supported by electronic informational capabilities including education tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet to that end we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as “smart” products we believe that these smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of quickly rising health care costs for their employees membership in our smart products and other consumerchoice health plans increased to 371100 members at december 31 2005 a 52 increase from december 31 2004 we believe that growth in these products which are offered both on a fully insured and aso basis and competitively priced to produce higher margins is a key component among other items for further improvement in the results of our commercial segment additionally we have increased the diversification of our commercial membership base not only through our consumerchoice products but also by 1 expanding our aso membership in the midmarket group segment to take advantage of our network discounts and 2 launching our humanaone individual product to address an increasing migration of insureds from small group while we expect our consumerchoice products to become a driver of growth in the years ahead as health care inflation persists we also are enhancing the traditional products which comprise the bulk of our commercial portfolio today by applying our consumerchoice innovation 

other important factors which impact our commercial segment profitability are both the competitive pricing environment and market conditions with respect to pricing there is a tradeoff between sustaining or increasing underwriting margins versus increasing or decreasing enrollment we have experienced a decline in our fully insured commercial membership as a result of pricing actions by some competitors who we perceive as desiring to gain market share in certain markets with respect to market conditions we are impacted by economies of scale on administrative overhead as a result of a decline in preference for tightlymanaged hmo products medical costs have become increasingly comparable among our larger competitors product design and consumer involvement have become more important drivers of medical services consumption and administrative expense efficiency is becoming a more significant driver of commercial margin sustainability consequently we continually evaluate our administrative expense structure and realize administrative expense savings through productivity gains additionally because our commercial segment shares overhead costs with our government segment an increase or decrease in the size of our government operations impacts our commercial segment profitability 

highlights 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements 

settlement of class action litigation 

on october 17 2005 we reached an agreement with representatives of more than 700000 physicians to settle a nationwide class action suit subject to court approval in connection with the settlement and other related litigation costs we recorded pretax administrative expenses of 719 million 448 million after taxes or 027 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2005 of the 719 million 334 million is included in the government segment results and the remaining 385 million is included in the commercial segment results the settlement is more fullydescribed under “legal proceedings” in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

hurricane katrina 

certain of our operations primarily the louisiana market were negatively affected by the impact of hurricane katrina in august 2005 expenses related to hurricane katrina primarily stem from our efforts in cooperation with departments of insurance in the affected states to help our members by offering participatingprovider benefits at nonparticipating providers’ rates paying claims for members who were unable at the time to meet their premium obligations and similar measures in connection with hurricane katrina we recorded pretax medical and administrative expenses of 270 million 169 million after taxes or 010 per diluted common share during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 of the 270 million 59 million is included in the government segment results and the remaining 211 million is included in the commercial segment results we do not anticipate any significant additional costs for hurricane katrina related items in 2006 

recent acquisitions 

in january 2006 our commercial segment reached an agreement to acquire cha service company or cha health for cash consideration of approximately 600 million plus any excess statutory surplus the acquisition of cha health a kentucky health plan is expected to add approximately 96800 members to our commercial segment medical membership this transaction which is subject to regulatory approval is expected to close effective in the second quarter of 2006 

  

on december 20 2005 our commercial segment acquired corphealth inc a behavioral health care management company for cash consideration of approximately 542 million including transaction costs this acquisition allows humana to integrate coverage of medical and behavior health benefits 

on february 16 2005 we acquired careplus health plans of florida or careplus as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately 4449 million in cash including transaction costs adding approximately 50400 medicare advantage members in miamidade broward and palm beach counties this acquisition enhances our medicare market position in south florida 

on april 1 2004 we acquired ochsner health plan or ochsner from the ochsner clinic foundation for 1571 million in cash ochsner a louisiana health plan added approximately 152600 commercial medical members primarily in fully insured large group accounts and approximately 33100 members in the medicare advantage program 

these transactions are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r sharebased payment  or sfas 123r which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stockbased compensation this requirement represents a significant change because fixedbased stock option awards a predominate form of stock compensation for us were not recognized as compensation expense under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees  sfas 123r requires that the cost of the award as determined on the date of grant at fair value be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period the grantdate fair value of the award will be estimated using optionpricing models in addition certain tax effects of stock option exercises will be reported as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in the statements of cash flows we adopted sfas 123r on january 1 2006 under the retrospective transition method using the blackscholes pricing model the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the blackscholes pricing model reduced diluted earnings per common share as retroactively restated for the adoption of sfas 123r by 008 in 2005 006 in 2004 and 003 in 2003 as more fully disclosed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data in addition the classification of cash inflows from any excess tax benefit associated with exercising stock options will change from an operating activity to a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows with no impact on total cash flows we estimate the impact of this change in classification will decrease operating cash flows and increase financing cash flows by approximately 155 million in 2005 37 million in 2004 and 152 million in 2003 

on february 23 2006 the board of directors approved the issuance of 1517507 additional options and restricted stock awards this grant was weighted more towards awards of restricted stock than stock options as compared to grants made in prior years consequently compensation expense for 2006 is anticipated to be 008 per diluted common share related to stock options due to adopting sfas 123r and 005 per diluted common share related to restricted stock these amounts which in total are in line with previous guidance are dependent on certain assumptions including additional grants during 2006 as disclosed above the pro forma effect of expensing stock options was 008 per diluted common share in 2005 and as disclosed in note 11 of the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was 002 per diluted common share in 2005 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2005 and 2004 

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 

 

   medical membership was as follows at december 31 2005 and 2004 

 

 this table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages 

  

summary 

net income was 3085 million or 187 per diluted common share in 2005 compared to 2800 million or 172 per diluted common share in 2004 the increase in net income primarily resulted from improved profits in our government segment driven by gains in membership and improved underwriting results in both our medicare and tricare operations 

net income for 2005 included expenses resulting from the class action litigation settlement 448 million after taxes or 027 per diluted common share and costs associated with hurricane katrina 169 million after taxes or 010 per diluted common share net income for 2005 also included the favorable effect of an effective tax rate of approximately 269 compared to 327 in 2004 primarily due to the resolution of a contingent tax gain 228 million or 014 per diluted common share during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 103 to 140 billion for 2005 compared to 127 billion for 2004 higher government segment premium revenues were partially offset by a decrease in commercial segment premium revenues premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 318 to 75 billion for 2005 compared to 57 billion for 2004 this increase primarily was attributable to our medicare advantage operations and the effects of transitioning to the tricare south contract during 2004 medicare advantage membership was 557800 at december 31 2005 compared to 377200 at december 31 2004 an increase of 180600 members or 479 this increase was due to expanded participation in various medicare advantage programs and geographic markets as well as the careplus acquisition the february 16 2005 careplus acquisition added 50400 members and 4863 million in premium revenues in 2005 average per member premiums for our medicare advantage business increased approximately 12 during 2005 this reflects a shift in our medicare membership mix to higher reimbursement markets due primarily to the south florida careplus acquisition medicare geographic expansions during 2006 are anticipated to contribute to continued enrollment growth with projected medicare advantage enrollment in the range of 900000 to 1100000 at december 31 2006 and pdp enrollment in the range of 1900000 to 2200000 at december 31 2006 total medicare premium revenue for 2006 is projected to more than double from 2005 tricare premium revenues increased 132 in 2005 reflecting the transition to the new south region contract during 2004 which included a temporary loss of approximately 1 million members for 4 months in 2004 medicaid membership declined by 20700 members from december 31 2004 to december 31 2005 primarily due to the fact that we did not renew our participation in the medicaid program for the state of illinois on july 31 2005 the illinois medicaid business was not material to our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

commercial segment premium revenues decreased 73 to 65 billion for 2005 compared to 70 billion for 2004 lower premium revenues primarily resulted from a reduction of fully insured membership partially offset by increases in average per member premiums our fully insured membership decreased 125 or 286700 members to 1999800 at december 31 2005 compared to 2286500 at december 31 2004 the decrease is primarily due to the relinquishment of an 89000member unprofitable account on january 1 2005 and continued attrition due to the ongoing competitive environment within the fully insured group accounts partially offset by membership gains in the individual and consumerchoice product lines average per member premiums for our fully insured group medical members increased approximately 7 to 9 in 2005 and are anticipated to further increase in the range of 7 to 9 in 2006

our administrative services fees for 2005 were 2594 million a decrease of 134 million or 49 from 2728 million for 2004 

administrative services fees for the government segment decreased 567 million or 531 from 1068 million for 2004 to 501 million for 2005 this decline resulted from the transition to the new south region contract which carved out certain government programs including the administration of pharmacy and medical benefits to senior members over the age of 65 we transitioned services under these separate programs to other providers during 2004 

for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 434 million or 261 from 1660 million for 2004 to 2094 million for 2005 this increase resulted from increased membership and higher average per member fees aso membership of 1171000 members at december 31 2005 increased 150 compared to 1018600 at december 31 2004 average per member fees increased approximately 8 in 2005 

investment and other income 

investment and other income totaled 1571 million in 2005 an increase of 150 million from 1421 million in 2004 this increase primarily was attributable to increased investment income from higher interest rates and average invested balances offset by lower capital gains the average yield on investment securities was 40 in 2005 compared to 36 in 2004 the investment of cash flows from operations contributed to the increase in the average invested balance and added approximately 70 million to interest income net realized capital gains of 183 million in 2005 decreased 99 million from 282 million in 2004 as of december 31 2005 we had an unrealized gain of 523 million related to a venture capital investment we realized this gain in the first quarter of 2006 with the sale of this venture capital investment 

medical expense 

consolidated medical expenses increased 9818 million or 92 during 2005 the increase was primarily driven by the increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation and incremental medical expenses related to the careplus acquisition 

the medical expense ratio or mer which is computed by taking total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues represents a key industry statistic used to measure underwriting profitability 

the consolidated mer for 2005 was 832 decreasing 90 basis points from 841 for 2004 due to improvements in both the commercial and government segments as further discussed below the 2005 consolidated mer includes 20 basis points for expenses associated with hurricane katrina 

the government segment’s medical expenses increased 14 billion or 300 during 2005 primarily due to the increase in average per member claims costs and the increase in the number of medicare members including those related to the careplus acquisition the increase in average per member claims costs for medicare approximated 8 to 10 during 2005 

the government segment’s mer for 2005 was 831 a 120 basis point decrease from the 2004 rate of 843 excluding a 10 basis point increase in the 2005 mer from hurricane katrina the decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in medicare revenues as a percentage of total government segment revenues and average per member medicare premiums outpacing average per member medicare claim costs 

the commercial segment’s medical expenses decreased 4652 million or 80 this decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs the increase in average per member claims costs for fully insured group members was approximately 7 to 9 for 2005 

  

the mer for the commercial segment of 833 in 2005 decreased 60 basis points from the 2004 mer of 839 higher medical expenses from hurricane katrina increased the 2005 mer 30 basis points after considering the effect of hurricane katrina the decrease in mer for the 2005 period primarily reflects the absence of the unprofitable 89000member large group account that lapsed on january 1 2005 

sga expense 

consolidated selling general and administrative sga expenses increased 2989 million or 159 during 2005 primarily resulting from an increase in the number of employees due to the medicare expansion the class action litigation settlement and increased advertising and marketing costs also due to the medicare expansion these increases were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses associated with transitioning to the tricare south contract in 2004 during 2005 the number of employees increased 5000 to 18700 at december 31 2005 primarily in the sales and customer service functions associated with the growth in the medicare business as well as approximately 1200 employees added with the careplus acquisition 

the sga expense ratio which is computed by taking total selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees represents a key industry statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2005 was 153 increasing 80 basis points from 145 for 2004 expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of the class action litigation expenses the sga expense ratio increase primarily resulted from a commercial membership mix shift and increased spending associated with the medicare expansion the consolidated sga expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 12 to 13 for 2006 reflecting the continuing beneficial effect of growth in revenues and membership leveraging fixed costs 

our government and commercial segments bear direct and indirect overhead sga expenses we allocate indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

sga expenses in the government segment increased 2462 million or 347 during 2005 due to the careplus acquisition increased spending associated with the medicare expansion and the class action litigation settlement these increases were partially offset by a decrease in tricare expenses from the transition to the south contract in 2004 the government segment sga expense ratio increased 40 basis points from 122 for 2004 to 126 for 2005 expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 40 basis points for 2005 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 527 million or 45 during 2005 the commercial segment sga expense ratio increased 190 basis points from 164 for 2004 to 183 for 2005 expenses related to the class action litigation settlement increased the sga expense ratio 60 basis points for 2005 after considering the effect of the class action litigation expenses this increase resulted from the continued shift in the mix of membership towards aso aso business bears a significantly higher sga ratio than fully insured business 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2005 totaled 1289 million compared to 1178 million for 2004 an increase of 111 million or 94 amortization of other intangible assets increased 133 million during 2005 primarily as a result of intangible assets recorded in connection with the careplus acquisition 

interest expense 

interest expense was 393 million for 2005 compared to 232 million for 2004 an increase of 161 million this increase primarily resulted from higher interest rates and higher average outstanding debt the 

  

higher average outstanding debt balance increased interest expense 50 million during 2005 the average interest rate during 2005 of 53 increased 140 basis points compared to 39 during 2004 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate in 2005 of 269 decreased 58 compared to the 327 effective tax rate in 2004 the effective tax rate for 2005 reflects the favorable impact from the resolution of a contingent tax gain of 228 million during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate we expect the 2006 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35 to 37 

comparison of results of operations for 2004 and 2003 

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 

 

     

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2004 and 2003 

 

 this table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages 

summary 

net income was 2800 million or 172 per diluted common share in 2004 compared to 2289 million or 141 per diluted common share in 2003 the increase in net income consisted of improved profits in both of our business segments driven by higher earnings from our medicare and commercial products the 2003 results included expenses for asset impairments as more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

premium revenues and medical membership 

premium revenues increased 73 to 127 billion for 2004 compared to 118 billion for 2003 higher premium revenues resulted primarily from the ochsner acquisition as more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data and an increase in medicare advantage and fully insured commercial average per member premiums items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

government segment premium revenues increased 88 to 57 billion for 2004 compared to 53 billion for 2003 this increase primarily was attributable to our medicare advantage operations medicare advantage membership was 377200 at december 31 2004 compared to 328600 at december 31 2003 an increase of 48600 members or 148 including 33100 members added through the acquisition of ochsner average per member premiums for our medicare advantage business increased approximately 10 for 2004 reflecting higher reimbursement from cms tricare premium revenues decreased 54 in 2004 reflecting the transition to the new south region contract which included a temporary loss of approximately 1 million members for 4 months in 2004 

commercial segment premium revenues increased 61 to 70 billion for 2004 compared to 65 billion for 2003 this increase resulted from the ochsner acquisition and increases in average per member premiums in the 6 to 8 range on our fully insured commercial business partially offset by membership attrition average per member premium increases of 6 to 8 include the impact of an increasing mix of individual products into our fully insured membership a lower premium corresponding to lower benefits on products sold to individuals reduced our average per member premium trend by approximately 150 to 200 basis points our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 28 or 66300 members to 2286500 at december 31 2004 after 

  

giving effect to the addition of 152600 members from the acquisition of ochsner without giving effect to the ochsner acquisition the decrease was primarily due to the lapse of certain underperforming large group accounts totaling approximately 94000 members in 2004 and continued attrition due to the ongoing competitive environment within the small to midmarket group fully insured accounts partially offset by membership gains in the individual product lines 

administrative services fees 

our administrative services fees for 2004 were 2728 million an increase of 11 million or 04 from 2717 million for 2003 this increase resulted primarily from higher commercial aso membership partially offset by lower fees related to tricare’s change in governmentcontracted services as described below 

administrative services fees for the government segment decreased 421 million or 283 from 1488 million for 2003 to 1068 million for 2004 this decline resulted from the transition to the new south region contract which carved out certain government programs including the administration of pharmacy and medical benefits to senior members over the age of 65 we transitioned services under these separate programs to other providers during 2004 

for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 432 million or 352 from 1228 million for 2003 to 1660 million for 2004 this increase resulted from a higher level of aso membership at december 31 2004 which was 1018600 members compared to 712400 members at december 31 2003 an increase of 43 

investment and other income 

investment and other income totaled 1421 million in 2004 an increase of 127 million from 1294 million in 2003 this increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average invested balance partially offset by a decrease in net realized capital gains of approximately 84 million the investment of cash flows from operations contributed to the increase in the average invested balance and added approximately 188 million to interest income the average yield on investment securities was 36 in 2004 compared to 35 in 2003 

medical expense 

consolidated medical expenses increased 7902 million or 80 to 107 billion in 2004 from 99 billion in 2003 the increase was primarily driven by the ochsner acquisition and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation 

the consolidated mer for 2004 was 841 increasing 60 basis points from 835 for 2003 primarily due to the increase in the mer for the commercial segment 

the government segment’s medical expenses increased 3861 million or 87 during 2004 primarily due to the increase in the number of medicare members including those related to the ochsner acquisition and the increase in average per member claims costs partially offset by lower medical expenses associated with transitioning to the tricare south contract 

the government segment’s mer for 2004 was 843 which was flat when compared to 2003 the medicare advantage premium increases were consistent with medical cost increases for 2004 reflecting our efforts of adjusting benefit levels commensurate with reimbursement rates 

the commercial segment’s medical expenses increased 4042 million or 74 during 2004 the increase was primarily driven by an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation the increase in average per member claims costs for fully insured group members was approximately 8 to 10 for 2004 

  

the commercial segment’s mer for 2004 was 839 increasing 100 basis points from 2003 of 829 the 100 basis point increase was primarily due to underwriting losses associated with a large customer account serving approximately 89000 members and a competitive pricing environment in the 2 to 300 life customer group the 89000member large group account lapsed on january 1 2005 increasing per member premiums commensurate with claims trend becomes more difficult in a competitive pricing environment 

sga expense 

consolidated sga expenses increased 198 million or 11 to 19 billion in 2004 included in 2003 were costs of 172 million from the impairment of the jacksonville florida service center building more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data excluding the impairment the increase resulted from higher commercial segment sga expenses partially offset by lower government segment sga expenses 

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2004 was 145 decreasing 90 basis points from 154 for 2003 this decrease as well as the decrease in each of our segments’ sga expense ratios was the result of the revenue growth in excess of administrative cost inflation and operational efficiencies including gains from completing the consolidation of seven service centers into four during 2003 the jacksonville florida building writedown increased the 2003 sga expense ratio 10 basis points 

sga expenses in the government segment decreased 157 million or 22 during 2004 primarily due to a decrease in tricare sga expenses from transitioning to the south contract partially offset by the ochsner acquisition the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 120 basis points from 134 for 2003 to 122 for 2004 the government segment sga expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 20 basis point impact from the jacksonville florida building writedown 

the commercial segment sga expenses increased 355 million or 31 during 2004 primarily due to the ochsner acquisition the commercial segment sga expense ratio decreased 50 basis points from 169 for 2003 to 164 for 2004 the commercial segment sga expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 10 basis point impact from the jacksonville florida building writedown 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization for 2004 totaled 1178 million compared to 1268 million for 2003 a decrease of 90 million or 71 accelerated depreciation from reducing the estimated useful life of software increased depreciation expense 93 million in 2004 and 135 million in 2003 amortization of other intangible assets decreased when the other intangible assets allocated to an acquired tricare contract became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003 this was partially offset by the increased amortization expense associated with other intangible assets recorded in connection with the april 1 2004 ochsner acquisition 

interest expense 

interest expense was 232 million for 2004 compared to 174 million for 2003 an increase of 58 million this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of 300 million senior notes in august 2003 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate in 2004 of 327 decreased 09 compared to the 336 effective tax rate in 2003 our effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to taxexempt investment income see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

  

liquidity 

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums administrative services fees investment income as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments sga expenses interest expense taxes purchases of investment securities capital expenditures acquisitions and payments on borrowings because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months in many instances our business should normally produce positive cash flows during a period of increasing enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during a period of shrinking enrollment we have recently been experiencing improving operating cash flows associated with growth in medicare enrollment 

cash and cash equivalents increased to 7320 million at december 31 2005 from 5801 million at december 31 2004 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 is summarized as follows 

 

 cash flow from operating activities 

our operating cash flows in 2004 were significantly impacted by the timing of the medicare advantage premium remittance which is payable to us on the first day of each month when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday we have historically received this payment at the end of the previous month as such the medicare advantage receipts for january 2004 of 2119 million and january 2003 of 2058 million were received in december 2003 and december 2002 respectively because january 1 is a holiday 

beginning in 2005 the monthly premium payment schedule included a change in timing from previous practice this new practice made an exception to the holiday rule for the january 1 payment although january 1 always represents a holiday the new practice results in the january 1 payment being received on the first business day of january as a result of this change the january 2005 payment of 2903 million originally scheduled to be received on friday december 31 2004 was changed to monday january 3 2005 or one business day later therefore we received 12 monthly medicare advantage premium remittances in 2005 11 in 2004 and 12 in 2003 

in addition to the impact from the timing of the medicare advantage premium receipts higher earnings and medicare enrollment growth contributed to increased operating cash flows in 2005 2004 and 2003 comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by changes in our working capital the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and administrative services fees and payments of medical expenses we illustrate these changes with the following summary of receivables and medical and other expenses payable 

  

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 tricare base receivables began increasing in 2004 due to the transition to the reimbursement model under the south region contract beginning on august 1 2004 under our former tricare contracts with a fixed price we bore the cost of changes in the underlying pattern of health care for which the government was at risk until subsequently reimbursed in a later period through a bid price adjustment or bpa process the fixed price and bpa process added variability to our revenues related receivables and operating cash flows because the timing of the settlement was uncertain under the new tricare south region contract the fixed price and bpa process was eliminated and replaced with a new reimbursement model we are reimbursed by the federal government generally within 15 calendar days of when we pay the claim under the new reimbursement model 

the delivery of health care services under the tricare south region contract results in 1 a lag between the time the service is provided and when the claim is paid by us generally three months and 2 a lag between the time the claim is paid by us and ultimately reimbursed by the federal government generally 15 calendar days thus the claims reimbursement component of tricare base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period the transition to the south region contract had the effect of increasing the tricare base receivable and by a like amount increasing tricare claims payable 

in addition to the effect of transitioning to the new south region contract reimbursement model tricare base receivables and related claims payable increased in 2005 from higher claims inventories at our third party claims processing vendor the 263 million increase in tricare change order receivables resulted from negotiating an equitable adjustment to the contract price in late 2005 for services not originally specified in the contract we expect to collect the majority of these receivables during the first half of 2006 

the 637 million increase in medicare advantage receivables as of december 31 2005 as compared to december 31 2004 primarily resulted from recording revenues associated with cms’s risk adjustment model cms has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans including humana according to health severity this model pays more for enrollees with predictably higher costs under this risk adjustment methodology diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to 

  

calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us we collect capture and submit the necessary diagnosis data to cms weekly we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data we submitted to cms this also resulted in a corresponding increase in the capitation payable to physicians under risk sharing arrangements discussed below 

the detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

    medical and other expenses payable primarily increased during 2005 due to 1 growth in medicare membership 2 medical claims inflation 3 the transition to the new south region contract 4 an increase in the tricare payable resulting from an increase in claims inventory at our third party claims processing vendor as discussed under the total net receivables table on the previous page and 5 an increase in the capitation payable to physicians under risk sharing arrangements 

medical and other expenses payable increased during 2004 due primarily to medical claims inflation 

cash flow from investing activities 

during 2005 we paid 3528 million to acquire careplus net of 921 million of cash acquired and we paid 500 million to acquire corphealth net of 40 million of cash acquired during 2004 we paid 1418 million to acquire ochsner net of 153 million of cash acquired 

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows over the last several years in investment securities primarily shortduration fixed income securities totaling 2333 million in 2005 4073 million in 2004 and 2831 million in 2003 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 1658 million in 2005 1141 million in 2004 and 1013 million in 2003 the increased spending in 2005 primarily resulted from our medicare expansion initiatives excluding acquisitions we expect our total capital expenditures in 2006 to range between 125 million and 135 million 

  

during 2004 and 2003 proceeds from the sale of property and equipment relate primarily to consolidating our service centers in jacksonville and san antonio including the sale of the jacksonville office tower in 2004 for 148 million and a san antonio office building for 59 million in 2003 

cash flow from financing activities 

during 2005 we borrowed 494 million under our credit agreement this amount included 294 million which we borrowed temporarily to finance the careplus acquisition additional borrowings related primarily to the anticipation of funding additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2006 in conjunction with anticipated growth in revenues 

during 2003 we issued 300 million in 63 senior notes due august 1 2018 in order to repay our shortterm debt and take advantage of historically low interest rates in addition during 2003 we received proceeds of 316 million in exchange for new swap agreements see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data for more detailed information regarding our borrowings and swap agreements 

the remainder of the cash provided by financing activities in 2005 2004 and 2003 resulted primarily from the change in the book overdraft proceeds from stock option exercises and the change in the securities lending payable during 2005 we acquired approximately 68300 of our common shares in connection with employee stock plans at an aggregate cost of 24 million or an average of 3462 per share in 2004 we repurchased 36 million common shares in open market transactions and 02 million common shares in connection with employee stock plans for 670 million at an average price of 1783 per share in 2003 we repurchased 23 million common shares in open market transactions and 14 million common shares in connection with employee stock plans for 441 million at an average price of 1203 per share the board of directors’ authorization for open market transactions expired in january 2005 

senior notes 

we issued in the public debt capital markets 300 million aggregate principal amount of 725 senior unsecured notes that mature on august 1 2006 and 300 million aggregate principal amount of 630 senior unsecured notes that mature on august 1 2018 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on libor as more fully discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data 

credit agreement 

our 5year 600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in september 2009 under the agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion of the agreement bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the spread which varies depending on our credit ratings ranges from 50 to 1125 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 15 basis points may fluctuate between 125 and 375 basis points depending upon our credit ratings in addition a utilization fee of 125 basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50 of the total 600 million commitment the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis at our option 

the 5year 600 million credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios at december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements the terms of this credit agreement also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our 

  

ability to borrow we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect at this time we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to us we have other relationships including financial advisory and banking with some of the parties to the credit agreement 

at december 31 2005 we had 200 million of borrowings under the credit agreement outstanding at an interest rate of 504 in addition we have outstanding letters of credit of 351 million secured under the credit agreement no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit as of december 31 2005 we had 3649 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement 

commercial paper program 

we maintain and may issue shortterm debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow the program is backed by our credit agreement described above aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreement and commercial paper program generally may not exceed 600 million 

at december 31 2005 and 2004 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

other borrowings 

other borrowings of 36 million at december 31 2005 represent financing for the renovation of a building bear interest at 2 per annum are collateralized by the building and are payable in various installments through 2014 

shelf registration 

our universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission allows us to register the sale of debt or equity securities from time to time with the amount price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale we have up to 300 million remaining from a total of 600 million under the universal shelf registration the net proceeds from any future sales of our debt securities under the universal shelf registration may be used for our operations and for other general corporate purposes including repayment or refinancing of borrowings working capital capital expenditures investments acquisitions or the repurchase of our outstanding securities given revised rules relating to universal shelf registration statements we are exploring our options to file a new shelf registration statement 

liquidity requirements 

we believe our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements and fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 

adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2005 was baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s and bbb according to standard  poor’s ratings services or sp a downgrade to ba2 or lower by moody’s and bb or lower by sp would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a 300 million notional amount the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap agreement if cancelled we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on december 31 2005 we would have received 58 million net and future net interest payments would increase assuming libor does not change other than the swap agreements adverse changes in our credit ratings may not create increase or accelerate any liabilities 

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are 

  

subject to regulatory restrictions cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at the parent company decreased 197 million to 4196 million at december 31 2005 compared to 4393 million at december 31 2004 reflecting the use of parent company cash for acquisition activity during 2005 see schedule i to this form 10k beginning on page 107 for our parent company only financial information 

regulatory requirements 

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

as of december 31 2005 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 12032 million in our state regulated subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 7222 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level given our anticipated premium growth in 2006 resulting from the expansion of our medicare products capital requirements will increase we expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from humana inc our parent company in the range of 450 million to 650 million in 2006 

most states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by all states and puerto rico at december 31 2005 we would be required to fund 147 million in one of our puerto rico subsidiaries to meet all requirements after this funding we would have 3782 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 

contractual obligations 

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2005 as follows 

 

     

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2005 we are not involved in any spe transactions 

guarantees and indemnifications 

our operating lease of an airplane which expires january 1 2010 provides for a residual value payment of no more than 48 million at the end of the lease term at the end of the term we have the right to exercise a purchase option for 89 million or the airplane can be sold to a third party if we decide not to exercise our purchase option we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of 48 million this amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds in excess of 42 million from the sale of the airplane to a third party 

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our tricare subsidiaries 

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

related parties 

no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 27 2006 – see “certain transactions with management and others” 

government contracts 

our medicare business which accounted for approximately 32 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily consisted of hmo ppo and pffs products covered under the medicare advantage contracts with the federal government the contracts are renewed generally for a oneyear term each december 31 unless cms notifies humana of its decision not to renew by may 1 of the contract year or humana notifies cms of its decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 

our tricare business which accounted for approximately 17 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily consisted of the south region contract the 5year south region contract is subject to annual renewals at the government’s option and expires march 31 2009 this contract contains provisions to negotiate a target health care cost amount annually with the federal government any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government as such events and 

  

circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business these changes may include for example an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government’s decision to increase or decrease us military presence around the world in the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our medicaid business which accounted for approximately 4 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 consisted of contracts in puerto rico florida and illinois our 3year contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration which accounted for approximately 3 of our total premium and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 were extended a fourth year and these contracts expire on june 30 2006 we are preparing to bid on the new contracts that will be effective july 2006 although a request for such proposal has not yet been issued by the puerto rico health insurance administration at this time we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that any government policy decisions might have on our medicaid contracts in puerto rico 

our other current medicaid contract which is in florida is scheduled to expire on june 30 2006 due to medicaid reform in florida we are currently negotiating the terms and rates for the renewal contract we expect the current contract to be extended until august 31 2006 and the subsequent renewal contract to be effective for a twoyear term beginning september 1 2006 due to continual decreases in the reimbursement from the state of illinois we exited the illinois medicaid market effective july 31 2005 the illinois and florida medicaid contracts accounted for approximately 1 of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december 31 2005 

other than as described herein the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

legal proceedings 

we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business including employment matters breach of contract actions tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” of item 3 in part 1 we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters in addition recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

medical expense recognition 

medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows 

 

 estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results from operations and overall financial position for example a 100 basis point or 1 percent change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at december 31 2005 which represents approximately 43 of total liabilities would require an adjustment of approximately 19 million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known 

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns as well as historical medical cost trends depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels product mix and weekday seasonality 

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation 

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

  

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2005 data 

 

   most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 2 of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than 12 months as such we expect that substantially all of the december 31 2005 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2006 

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

ibnr established in connection with our tricare contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than for our other operations because there are more variables that impact the estimate these additional variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions many of these variables are impacted by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the united states armed forces we have considered all of these factors in establishing our ibnr estimate each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

as more fully described on page 55 our tricare contract contains risksharing provisions with the department of defense and with subcontractors which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid as a result of these contract provisions the impact of changes in estimates for prior year tricare medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially whether positive or negative 

as more fully described on pages 11 and 12 we have a significant percentage of our medicare and medicaid membership under risksharing arrangements with providers accordingly the impact of changes in 

  

estimates for prior year medical claims payable on our results from operations that are attributable to our medicare and medicaid lines of business may also be significantly reduced whether positive or negative 

the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

 

 amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development 

as summarized in the previous table claim reserve balances at december 31 2004 ultimately settled during 2005 for 1142 million less than the amounts originally estimated representing 11 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2004 during 2004 claim reserve balances at december 31 2003 ultimately settled for 935 million less than the amounts originally estimated representing 09 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2003 this 207 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted primarily from favorable development in our tricare line of business as a result of less than expected utilization in the latter half of 2004 

during 2003 claim reserve balances at december 31 2002 ultimately settled during 2003 for 761 million less than the amounts originally estimated representing 08 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2002 the 174 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2004 as compared to 2003 resulted primarily from favorable development in our medicare line of business as a result of less than expected utilization in the latter half of 2003 

revenue recognition 

we generally establish oneyear contracts with commercial employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30day written notice our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage 

our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our medicare advantage and pdp contracts with the federal government which renew annually except for tricare contracts discussed in the following section our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items such as age working status or specific health issues of the member for example cms has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity 

  

the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs as more fully described on page 5 under this risk adjustment methodology diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us we collect capture and submit the necessary diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to cms and ultimately accepted by cms 

cms is transitioning to the risk adjustment model while the old demographic model is phased out the demographic model based the monthly premiums paid to health plans on factors such as age sex and disability status the monthly premium amount for each member is separately determined under both the risk adjustment and demographic model these separate payment amounts are then blended according to the transition schedule cms is transitioning to the risk adjustment model for medicare advantage plans as follows 50 in 2005 75 in 2006 and 100 in 2007 the pdp payment methodology is based 100 on the risk adjustment model beginning in 2006 as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment model as well as budget neutrality as described on page 5 our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group an individual or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on historical trends we monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

we bill and collect premium and aso fee remittances from employer groups the federal and state governments and individual medicare advantage members monthly premium and aso fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 

tricare contract 

in 2005 tricare revenues represented 17 of total premiums and administrative services fees the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative service fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment disease management and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health care services are provided administrative service fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

the tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target health care cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is 

  

reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in medical expenses we continually review these medical expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

the tricare contract contains provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

our former tricare contracts for regions 3 and 4 and regions 2 and 5 which expired during 2004 contained provisions not only for change orders but for bid price adjustments or bpas as well there are no provisions for bpas in our current tricare contract bpas were utilized to retroactively adjust revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk including the risks associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities or mtfs change in the number of persons eligible for tricare benefits and medical unit cost inflation we worked closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and mtf workload data and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual bpa requirements final settlement of bpas occurred only at specified intervals typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year we recorded revenues applicable to bpas when these amounts were determinable and collectibility was reasonably assured 

investment securities 

investment securities totaled 27459 million or 40 of total assets at december 31 2005 debt securities totaled 27208 million or 99 of this investment portfolio more than 97 of our debt securities were of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by sp at december 31 2005 most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end bb or better of the noninvestment grade spectrum our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 34 years at december 31 2005 based on this duration a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately 90 million 

our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices nontraded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately held are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies where an observable quoted market price does not exist such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows unrealized holding gains and losses net of applicable deferred taxes are included as a component of stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income until realized from a sale or impairment 

  

gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december 31 2005 included the following 

 

 we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment we consider factors affecting the issuer factors affecting the industry the issuer operates within and general debt and equity market trends we consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value the severity of the decline the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment 

unrealized losses at december 31 2005 resulted from 447 positions out of a total of 731 positions held approximately 26 of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year the unrealized losses at december 31 2005 primarily were caused by increases in interest rates all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities after taking into account these and other factors including the severity of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and as such no impairment was required 

there were no impairment losses recorded in 2005 or 2004 we recorded 32 million in 2003 after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary 

goodwill and longlived assets 

at december 31 2005 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 27 of total assets and 75 of total stockholders’ equity 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we not amortize goodwill to earnings but instead that we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments the commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of fully and selfinsured medical and specialty the government segment’s 

  

three reporting units consist of medicare advantage tricare and medicaid goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios we used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weightedaverage cost of capital key assumptions including changes in membership premium yields medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss 

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation for these assets there were no impairment losses in 2005 we recognized losses due to impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of 93 million in 2004 and 308 million in 2003 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data

we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the evaluation was based on our fixed income portfolio and our debt position as of december 31 2005 and 2004 the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including among others unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio shifts in the asset mix between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven times libor was 454 at december 31 2005

the audit committee of the board of directors which is composed solely of outside directors meets periodically with members of management the internal auditors and our independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss internal controls over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors report to the audit committee and accordingly have full and free access to the audit committee at any time 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the company including its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to members of senior management and the board of directors 

based on our evaluation as of december 31 2005 we as the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer of the company have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported as specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms

general 

  

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc referred to throughout this document as “we” “us” “our” the “company” or “humana” is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies based on our 2004 revenues of 131 billion we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internetbased plans for employer groups governmentsponsored programs and individuals as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 70 million members in our medical insurance programs as well as approximately 17 million members in our specialty products programs we have approximately 495000 contracts with physicians hospitals dentists and other providers to provide health care to our members during 2004 43 of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government including 17 related to our tricare contracts and 15 related to one contract in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms under the cms contract in florida we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 231700 members additionally 37 of our premiums and administrative services fees in 2004 were earned from contracts with employer groups and individuals covering members located in texas illinois florida kentucky and ohio 

  

we were organized as a delaware corporation in 1964 our principal executive offices are located at 500 west main street louisville kentucky 40202 and the telephone number at that address is 502 5801000 we file annual quarterly and current reports proxy statements and other documents with the securities and exchange commission or sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act 

  

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see the “cautionary statements” section in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results 

  

business segments 

  

we manage our business with two segments commercial and government the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines of business fully insured medical administrative services only or aso and specialty the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicare advantage medicaid and tricare we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

  

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

  

our products 

  

the following table presents our segment membership premiums and aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

   

our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members 

  

consumerdirected products 

  

over the last several years we have developed and offered various commercial products designed to provide options and choices to employers that are annually facing substantial premium increases driven by doubledigit medical cost inflation these consumerdirected products which can be offered on either a fully insured or selffunded basis provided coverage to approximately 282000 members at december 31 2004 representing approximately 85 of our total commercial medical membership these products are often offered to employer groups as “bundles” where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the customer 

  

paramount to our consumerdirected product strategy we have developed a group of innovative consumer products styled as “smart” products that we believe will be a longterm solution for employers this new generation of products provides more 1 choices for the individual consumer 2 transparency of provider costs and 3 benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions including the tradeoffs between higher premiums and pointofservice costs at the time consumers choose their plans and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans we believe that when consumers can make informed choices about the cost and effectiveness of their health care a sustainable long term solution for employers can be realized in late 2004 we introduced a smart product option on a fullyinsured basis only to small businesses to allow them to experience the same advantages as the larger groups in lowering health benefits costs smart products which accounted for approximately 628 of enrollment in all of our consumerdirected plans only are sold to employers with humana as the sole carrier 

  

some employers have selected other types of consumerdirected products such as 1 a product with a high deductible 2 a catastrophic coverage plan or 3 ones that offer a spending account option in conjunction with more traditional medical coverage or as a stand alone plan unlike our smart products these products while valuable in helping employers deal with nearterm cost increases by shifting costs to employees are not considered longterm comprehensive solutions to the employers’ cost dilemma by us although we view this as an initial interim step 

  

hmo 

  

our health maintenance organization or hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include among others hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of a health benefit plan 

  

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers together with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician for the year ended december 31 2004 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 28 billion or 218 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

ppo 

  

our preferred provider organization or ppo products which are marketed primarily to commercial groups and individuals include some elements of managed health care however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees 

  

in june 2002 we introduced humanaone a major medical product marketed directly to individuals we introduced this product in select markets where we can both underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels this product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 commercial and individual ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 38 billion or 292 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

administrative services only 

  

we also offer administrative services only or aso products to employers who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo hmo or consumerdirected products described above under aso contracts selffunded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits however most aso customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs accordingly we have recorded premiums and medical expenses related to these stop loss arrangements for the year ended december 31 2004 commercial aso fees totaled 1660 million or 13 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

specialty products 

  

we additionally offer various specialty products including dental group and individual life and shortterm disability at december 31 2004 we had approximately 17 million specialty members including 12 million dental members for the year ended december 31 2004 specialty product premium revenues were approximately 3496 million or 27 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries 

  

medicare advantage products 

  

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits hospitalization benefits are provided under part a without the payment of any premium for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under part b beneficiaries eligible for part a and part b coverage under traditional medicare are still required to pay outofpocket deductibles and coinsurance 

  

we contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms under the medicare advantage program to provide health insurance benefits to medicare eligible persons under hmo ppo and private feeforservice or pffs plans in exchange for contractual payments received from cms with each of these products the beneficiary generally receives benefits in excess of traditional medicare typically including a prescription drug benefit a reduced monthly premium or reduced cost sharing medicare advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicarecovered services or for certain extra benefits beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries will have a prescription drug benefit and most medicare advantage plans must offer that benefit as part of the basic plan 

  

for our medicare hmo and ppo plans we contract with cms to provide health insurance benefits in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member for medicareeligible individuals residing in defined counties individuals who elect to participate in these plans receive benefits in excess of traditional medicare these benefits typically include a prescription drug benefit subject to cost sharing and some limitations additionally these benefits may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating innetwork providers or in emergency situations except in emergency situations hmo plans provide no outofnetwork benefits ppo plans carry an outof network benefit that is subject to higher member costsharing in many cases these beneficiaries also may be required to pay a monthly premium to the hmo or ppo plan in addition to the monthly part b premium they are required to pay the medicare program 

  

for our medicare pffs plans we contract with cms to offer health benefits to eligible medicare beneficiaries in certain states in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member under these plans we offer a prescription drug benefit subject to cost sharing and other limitations other health care benefits also may be different than traditional medicare individuals in these plans pay a monthly premium to receive these enhanced prescription drug benefits unlike the hmo and ppo plans these plans have no preferred network 

  

medicare uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to managed care plans in the last decade congress has made several changes to how cms must calculate these rates the old pre1998 methodology was based on the adjusted average per capita cost methodology or aapcc under aapcc cms projected average countylevel feeforservice spending for the coming year to set the reimbursement rates for medicare health plans at 95 percent of the full aapcc amount 

  

under the aapcc system payment rates per county varied widely for example the 1997 capitation rate for beneficiaries 65 and older for part a and part b services ranged from a low of 22092 in arthur county nebraska to a high of 76735 in richmond county staten island new york some states saw differences of more than 20 percent between adjacent counties since county feeforservice costs were used to estimate county managed care capitation rates the rates reflected differences among counties and regions in feeforservice utilization patterns and cost structures 

  

in the balanced budget act of 1997 bba congress created a new ratesetting methodology eliminating the direct link in the aapcc method between managed care rates and local feeforservice costs congress broke the direct link by requiring that each year a county rate was the highest of three types of rates each calculated differently than the old aapcc rate as a result the wide disparities in county capitation rates were reduced by bringing both high and low payment rates closer to the national average 

  

additionally the bba required cms to implement a risk adjustment payment system for medicare health plans risk adjustment uses health status indicators to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries cms initially phasedin this payment methodology with a risk adjustment model that based payment on principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as demographic factors such as gender age and medicaid eligibility from 2000 to 2003 risk adjusted payment accounted for only 10 percent of medicare health plans payment with the remaining 90 percent being based on demographic factors described above 

  

pursuant to the benefits and improvements protection act of 2000 bipa cms implemented a new risk adjustment model that uses additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms has also redesigned its data collection and processing system to further reduce administrative data burden on medicare health plans in 2004 the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 30 percent from 10 percent in 2003 the 100 phasein of risk adjusted payment will be completed in 2007 the portion of risk adjusted payment will increase to 50 percent in 2005 and 75 percent in 2006 

  

under the new risk adjustment methodology humana and all managed care organizations must capture collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology described above our cms monthly payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

  

over the fiveyear period beginning january 1 2000 and ending december 31 2004 our annual increases in per member premiums from cms have ranged from as low as approximately 2 to as high as approximately 12 with an average of approximately 5 during 2004 we experienced average overall increases in per member premiums in the range of 9 to 11 we are expecting a similar level of increase during 2005 

  

at december 31 2004 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 377200 medicare advantage members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 31 billion or 239 of our total premiums and aso fees for 2004 one such cms contract covered approximately 231700 members in south florida and accounted for premium revenues of approximately 20 billion which represented 649 of our medicare advantage premium revenues or 154 of our total premiums and aso fees for 2004 additionally on february 16 2005 we acquired careplus health plans of florida adding approximately 50000 medicare advantage hmo members to our south florida operations 

  

our hmo ppo and pffs products covered under medicare advantage contracts with cms are renewed for a oneyear term each december 31 unless notice of termination is received at least 90 days prior thereto no termination notices were received in connection with our currently existing plans additionally in 2004 we have established medicare pffs plans in eleven states and have recently established medicare ppo plans in many of our existing markets where we have established competitive provider networks we continue to evaluate additional states and local markets where we believe we can be competitive with these products and we anticipate further expansion during 2005 

  

medicaid product 

  

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a state specific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual 

  

relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

  

we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june 30 2005 our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois and are annual contracts for the year ended december 31 2004 premium revenues from our medicaid products totaled 5112 million or 39 of our total premiums and aso fees at december 31 2004 we had approximately 396600 medicaid members in puerto rico or 83 of total medicaid members and 82000 medicaid members in florida and illinois or 17 of total medicaid members 

  

tricare 

  

tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in an hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers 

  

we have participated in the tricare program since 1996 under contracts with the united states department of defense our current tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 29 million eligible beneficiaries in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee louisiana arkansas texas and oklahoma the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense the tricare south region contract is for a fiveyear period subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with the second option period scheduled to begin april 1 2005 we have subcontracted with third parties to provide selected administration and specialty services under the contract 

  

during 2004 we completed a contractual transition of our tricare business on july 1 2004 our regions 2 and 5 contract servicing approximately 11 million tricare members became part of the new north region which was awarded to another contractor on august 1 2004 our regions 3 and 4 contract became part of our new south region contract on november 1 2004 the region 6 contract previously administered by the same contractor with approximately 1 million members became part of the south region contract the members added with the region 6 contract essentially offset the members lost four months earlier with the regions 2 and 5 contract for the year ended december 31 2004 tricare premium revenues were approximately 21 billion or 164 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

at december 31 2004 we had 1082400 tricare aso members representing active duty beneficiaries seniors over the age of 65 and beneficiaries in puerto rico for which the department of defense retains all of the risk of financing the cost of their health benefit part of the tricare transition during 2004 included the carve out of the tricare senior pharmacy and tricare for life program which we previously administered on june 1 2004 and august 1 2004 administrative services under these programs were transferred to another contractor for the year ended december 31 2004 tricare administrative services fees totaled 1068 million or 08 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2004 by market and product 

  

   

provider arrangements 

  

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities we have approximately 495000 contracts with health care providers participating in our networks which consist of approximately 305800 physicians 3500 hospitals and 185700 ancillary providers and dentists these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

  

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems and enrolling members into various disease management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract provides services and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of quality patient care are met our hospitalist programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes cancer and certain other conditions 

  

we typically contract with hospitals on either 1 a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day 2 a case rate or diagnosisrelated groups drg which is an allinclusive rate per admission or 3 a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service ambulatory payment classifications or apcs or at a discounted charge apcs are similar to flat rates except multiple services and procedures may be aggregated into one fixed payment these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationallyrecognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

  

our contracts with physicians typically are renewed automatically each year unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

  

capitation 

  

for 53 of our december 31 2004 medical membership we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation per capita payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from 82 to 89 providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

  

for 74 of our december 31 2004 medical membership we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

  

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we monitor the financial performance and solvency of our capitated providers however we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

   

capitation expense as a percentage of total medical expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

accreditation assessment 

  

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs such as those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies as well as external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the 

  

health plan employer data information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate hmos based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

  

physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or jcaho 

  

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical license review of their malpractice liability claims history review of their board certification if applicable and review of any complaints including member appeals and grievances committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

  

we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commissionutilization review accreditation commission or aahcurac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo accreditation specific to the utilization review process also is required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by thirdparty labor agreements or those where a request is made by the employer may require or prefer accredited health plans 

  

ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management and member rights and responsibilities we continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through ncqa 

  

aahcurac performs reviews for utilization management standards and for health plan and health network standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management we continue to maintain urac accreditation in select markets and certain operations 

  

humana has pursued iso 90012000 over the past two years for the clinical innovation center iso is the international standards organization which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process called iso 90012000 at this time the following clinical programs have received iso 90012000 registration transplant management centralized clinical operations providing personal nurse services pharmacy management and disease management 

  

sales and marketing 

  

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of the employees or members since june 2002 we also offer commercial health insurance products to individuals 

  

we use various methods to market our commercial medicare advantage and medicaid products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings at december 31 2004 we used approximately 37400 licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 400 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume in addition to commission based directly on premium volume for sales to particular customers we also have programs that pay 

  

brokers and agents on other bases these include commission bonuses based on sales that attain certain levels or involve particular products we also pay additional commission based on aggregate volumes of sales involving multiple customers 

  

at december 31 2004 we employed approximately 600 sales representatives who are each paid a salary andor per member commission to market our medicare advantage and medicaid products in the continental united states we also employed approximately 350 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare advantage and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members 

  

risk management 

  

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group reform laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

  

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with medicare advantage products because cms regulations require us to accept all eligible medicare applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history we also are not permitted to employ underwriting criteria for the medicaid product but rather we follow cms and state requirements 

  

competition 

  

the health benefits industry is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid or renewed annually the number of plans participating in the medicare advantage program is likely to increase due to higher payments from the government the establishment of regional medicare advantage plans and the introduction of new medicare ppo plans additionally the impact of the new medicare bidding process replacing the adjusted community rate acr process in 2006 is uncertain our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers is or may be influenced by such factors as benefits pricing contract terms number and quality of participating physicians and other providers utilization review claims processing administrative efficiency relationships with agents quality of customer service and accreditation results 

  

government regulation 

  

government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules the passing of the medicare modernization act of 2004 represents the most sweeping changes to medicare since the bba changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results also it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 

  

enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation’s law enforcement entities the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is 

  

expected to continue the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare advantage medicaid and the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs the programs are subject to very technical rules when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 

  

we are subject to various governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions these include possible government actions relating to the employee retirement income security act as amended or erisa fehbp federal and state fraud and abuse laws laws regulating anticompetitive and unfair business activities and other laws relating to medicare advantage including adjusted community rating development special payment status risk adjusted premiums and various other areas the cms risk adjustment methodology is described on page 7 adjusted community rating development is the governmentdefined rating formula used to explain the medicare advantage benefits we offer individuals eligible for medicare benefits based on a particular community and certain other factors special payment status refers to among others medicare advantage beneficiaries who are institutionalized medicaideligible or members who have contracted endstage renal disease the medicare advantage plan receives a higher payment for members who qualify for one or more of these statuses 

  

on may 31 2000 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general for the department of health and human services as part of a settlement of a medicare overpayment issue arising from an audit by the office of the inspector general we are also subject to substantial regulation by the states in which we do business we regularly are audited and subject to various enforcement actions by state departments of insurance these departments enforce laws relating to all aspects of our operations including benefit offerings marketing claim payments and premium setting especially with regard to our small group business although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties and other sanctions against us including exclusion from participation in government programs we do not believe the results of any of these actions individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

of our eight licensed and active hmo subsidiaries as of february 1 2005 six are qualified under the federal health maintenance organization act of 1973 as amended to obtain federal qualification an hmo must meet certain requirements including conformance with benefit rating and financial reporting standards federal qualification allows us to participate in the fehbp program in certain markets and for certain products we operate hmos that are not federally qualified because this provides greater flexibility with respect to product design and pricing than is possible for federally qualified hmos 

  

as of february 1 2005 humana medical plan inc humana health plan of texas inc humana health benefit plan of louisiana inc and humana health plan inc each hold cms contracts under the medicare advantage program to sell medicare hmo products in a total of seven states in addition humana insurance company holds cms contracts under a medicare advantage program to sell a private feeforservice product in eleven states and ppo plans in many of our existing markets the ppo and hmo plans are considered “coordinated care plans” and have similar standards 

  

cms conducts audits of plans qualified under its medicare advantage program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations these audits include review of the plans’ administration and management including management information and data collection systems fiscal stability utilization management and physician incentive arrangements health services delivery quality assurance marketing enrollment and disenrollment activity claims processing and complaint systems 

  

cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements in addition cms requires certain disclosures to cms and to medicare advantage beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan 

  

contracted under the medicare advantage program cms’s rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between the plan and physicians in the plan’s networks these rules also require certain levels of stoploss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses relating to patient care depending on the amount of financial risk they assume the reporting of certain health care data contained in hedis is another important cms disclosure requirement 

  

our medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a medicaid product and by the health insurance administration in puerto rico in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies the reviews are similar in nature to those performed by cms 

  

laws in the commonwealth of puerto rico and each of the states in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including the scope of benefits rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance and our hmos are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health most states’ laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years 

  

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and commonwealth of puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

  

as of december 31 2004 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 11855 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 7172 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level certain states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by all states at december 31 2004 each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have 4056 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 

  

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business 

  

health care reform 

  

diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives continue at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

  

federal 

  

on december 8 2003 president bush signed into law the medicare modernization act of 2003 or mma mma makes many significant changes to the medicare feeforservice and medicare advantage programs as well as other changes to the commercial health insurance marketplace most significantly mma creates a prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2006 established a new medicare advantage program to replace the medicarechoice program and enacts health savings accounts or hsas for nonmedicare eligible individuals and groups 

  

beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries will be able to sign up for a standalone drug plan or join a private health plan under medicare advantage that offers drug coverage see description of our medicare advantage products beginning on page 6 for additional discussion 

  

the legislation established a new medicare private health plan program called medicare advantage to offer regional ppo options beginning in 2006 and a continuance of hmo pointofservice ppo and privatefeeforservice options in defined local service areas the legislation also includes a provision establishing hsa’s taxadvantaged savings accounts that can be used to pay for medical expenses incurred by individuals their spouse and their dependents 

  

the use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 

  

regulations issued in february 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april 21 2005 violations of these rules could subject us to significant penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent hipaa also could expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 

  

state 

  

we continue to encounter regulation on health care claims payment practices at the state level this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties supplemental legislation includes among other provisions claims submission content and electronic submission we view electronic submission as a favorable development that will simplify claims interactions a few states are considering proposals that place new limits on insurer contacts with hospitals and physicians these proposals include provisions to expand payment disclosure limit implementation of claims payment procedures and extend an insurer payment liability where intermediaries fail to pay and restrict recoupment 

  

some states are proposing the creation of small employer pooled purchasing arrangements although these pooled purchasing arrangements may affect the small group market most of the proposals require these purchasing arrangements to comply with the standard small group market regulations similar arrangements enacted in the early 1990s had a very limited affect on the small group insurance market a limited number of states are considering additional restrictions on the use of health status in small group rating mandatefree benefit plans are pending in a number of states some of these proposals could allow insurers more flexibility in the use of member cost sharing there is activity in some states supporting an expansion of disclosure by hospitals physicians and other health care providers of quality and charge data either directly to patients or to state agencies that must make it publicly available 

  

medical malpractice reform is receiving significant attention pending medical malpractice reform proposals differ substantially relative to the entities covered by the reforms since the substance of the reforms remains under discussion and the scope of covered entities has not been resolved in most states management is unable to predict future activity under these laws 

  

we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

other 

  

captive insurance company 

  

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain these risks through our whollyowned consolidated insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to our own general business risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of thirdparty insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses in an effort to minimize credit risk we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings since january 1 2002 we have reduced the amount of coverage purchased from thirdparty insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates we provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities as well as a rollforward of reserve activity related to our captive insurance subsidiary in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

managed care industry purported class action litigation 

  

we have been involved in several purported class action lawsuits that are part of a wave of generally similar actions that target the health care payer industry and particularly target managed care companies these include a lawsuit against us and originally nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of physicians who have treated our members as a result of action by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation “jpml” the case was consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and has been styled in re managed care litigation  

  

the plaintiffs assert that we and other defendants improperly paid providers’ claims and “downcoded” their claims by paying lesser amounts than they submitted the complaint alleges among other things multiple violations under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico as well as various breaches of contract and violations of regulations governing the timeliness of claim payments the complaint was subsequently amended to add as plaintiffs several medical societies including the texas medical association the medical association of georgia the california medical association the florida medical association and the louisiana state medical society each of which purports to bring its action against specified defendants 

  

on september 26 2002 the court certified a global class consisting of all medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by any defendant from august 4 1990 to september 26 2002 the class included two subclasses a national subclass consisted of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by a defendant when the doctor had a claim against such defendant and was not required to arbitrate that claim a california subclass consisted of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured in california by any defendant when the doctor was not bound to arbitrate the claim 

  

on september 1 2004 the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit “eleventh circuit” agreed with the district court’s ruling as to the class for the rico claims although it suggested that the class should be split so that claims involving capitation and feeforservice payments would be handled separately however it reversed the lower court as to state law claims including breach of contract unjust enrichment and violations of prompt pay laws it found that the state claims were too individualized to be dealt with in a class action the california subclass was not specifically challenged and therefore was permitted to remain on october 15 2004 the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court asking for review of the eleventh circuit’s decision the petition was denied on january 10 2005 

  

on december 9 2004 the court issued an order rescheduling the trial for september 6 2005 on february 10 2005 the court ruled that the trial would be bifurcated so that the issue of liability would be tried first followed by proof of damages if liability is found 

  

meanwhile on september 17 2004 the plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification seeking a global feeforservice class and five subclasses for the time period from january 1 1996 to the date of certification the global class would consist of any medical doctor who provided service on a feeforservice basis to any person insured by cigna corporation or any other defendant for claims of rico conspiracy and aiding and abetting the motion seeks subclasses for the conspiracy counts for capitation damages and capitation injunctive relief consisting of all medical doctors who provided services on a capitated basis the motion also requests a subclass for a direct rico claim consisting of medical doctors who provided services on a feeforservice basis to any person insured by humana pursuant to a contract without an arbitration clause or without a contract the motion which has not been ruled on also seeks two california subclasses one involving physicians who provided services on a feeforservice basis and the other for capitated physicians 

  

two of the defendants aetna inc and cigna corporation have entered into settlement agreements which have been approved by the court 

  

we intend to continue to defend this action vigorously 

  

government audits and other litigation and proceedings 

  

insurance industry brokerage practices matters 

  

we have responded to requests for information from the departments of insurance in the states of ohio and north carolina with respect to an industry wide investigation into certain insurance brokerage practices including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices in connection with this industry wide review we may receive requests for information or subpoenas from other regulators or attorneys general we intend to cooperate fully with any inquiries 

  

other 

  

in july 2000 the office of the florida attorney general initiated an investigation apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the managed care industry purported class action litigation described above on september 21 2001 the texas attorney general initiated a similar investigation no actions have been filed against us by either state these investigations are ongoing and we have cooperated with the regulators in both states 

  

on may 31 2000 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement or cia with the office of inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services under the cia we are obligated to among other things provide training conduct periodic audits and make periodic reports to the oig 

  

in addition our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities there has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the managed health care companies’ business practices including allegations of anticompetitive and unfair business activities claims payment practices commission payment practices and utilization management practices we have been and continue to be subject to such reviews some of these have resulted in fines and could require changes in some of our practices and could also result in additional fines or other sanctions 

  

we also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations including claims of medical malpractice bad faith nonacceptance or termination of providers improper rate setting failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements as well as challenges to subrogation practices we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers members 

  

and others including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 

  

in addition some courts have issued rulings which make it easier to hold plans liable for medical negligence on the part of network providers on the theory that providers are agents of the plans and that the plans are therefore vicariously liable for the injuries to members by providers 

  

personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted in addition insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

  

the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits like the purported class action lawsuit described above or governmental investigations cannot be accurately predicted with certainty in addition the potential for increased liability for medical negligence arising from claims adjudication along with the increased litigation that has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry adds to this uncertainty therefore such legal actions and government audits and investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

overview 

  

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies based on our 2004 revenues of 131 billion we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internetbased plans for employer groups governmentsponsored programs and individuals as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 70 million members in our medical insurance programs as well as approximately 17 million members in our specialty products programs during 2004 43 of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government including 17 related to our tricare contracts and 15 related to one contract in florida with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms additionally 37 of our premiums and administrative services fees in 2004 were earned from contracts with employer groups and individuals covering members located in texas illinois florida kentucky and ohio 

  

we manage our business with two segments commercial and government the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines of business fully insured medical administrative services only or aso and specialty the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicare advantage tricare and medicaid we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

  

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent we are somewhat unique in our industry by having revenues and enrollment approximately split between commercial and government segments drawing revenues from group individual medicare medicaid and military business lines we believe that it is difficult to time market cycles and external influences on various parts of our businesses by remaining committed to varied lines of business with a longterm view we may benefit through shortterm market cycles we believe our diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success 

  

our results are impacted by many factors but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium aso fee and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces including new technologies and medical procedures increasing capacity and supply of medical services new prescription drugs and therapies an aging population the tort liability system and government regulations 

  

our strategy to drive commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of a variety of innovative and consumerdirected product designs these products are supported by electronic informational capabilities including education tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet to that end we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as “smart” products we believe that these smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of quickly rising health care costs for their employees membership in our smart products and other consumerdirected health plans exceeded 280000 members at december 31 2004 more than doubling from a year ago we believe that growth in these products which are offered both on a fullyinsured and aso basis and may ultimately be competitively priced to produce higher margins is a key component among other items for further improvement in the results of our commercial segment additionally we have increased the diversification of our commercial membership base not only through our consumerchoice products but also by 1 expanding our aso membership to take advantage of our network discounts in the midmarket group segment and 2 launching our humanaone individual product to address an increasing migration of insureds from small group while we expect our smart products to become a driver of growth in the years ahead as health care inflation persists we are enhancing the traditional products which comprise the bulk of our commercial portfolio today by applying our consumerchoice innovation 

  

other important factors which impact our commercial segment profitability are both the competitive pricing environment and market conditions with respect to pricing there is a tradeoff between sustaining or increasing underwriting margins versus increasing or decreasing enrollment we have experienced a decline in our membership in the 2 to 300 life group size as a result of pricing actions by some competitors who we perceive as desiring to gain market share in certain markets with respect to market conditions we are impacted by economies of scale on administrative overhead as a result of a decline in preference for tightlymanaged hmo products medical costs have become increasingly comparable among the larger competitors product design and consumer involvement have become more important drivers of medical services consumption and administrative expense efficiency is becoming a more significant driver of commercial margin sustainability consequently we continually evaluate our administrative expense structure and realize administrative expense savings through productivity gains additionally because our commercial segment shares overhead costs with our government segment an increase or decrease in the size of our government operations impacts our commercial segment profitability 

  

in our government segment after being awarded the south region contract in 2003 we transitioned our tricare business to one of three newlycreated regions under the government’s revised tricare program on july 1 2004 our regions 2 and 5 contract servicing approximately 11 million tricare members became part of a new north region which was awarded to another contractor on august 1 2004 our regions 3 and 4 contract became part of our new south region contract on november 1 2004 the region 6 contract previously administered by the same contractor with approximately 1 million members became part of the south region contract the members added with the region 6 contract essentially offset the members lost four months earlier with the regions 2 and 5 contract with the transition complete we look forward to a more stable level of tricare membership in 2005 and the start of the second option year under the south contract on april 1 2005 as more fully discussed on page 45 tricare revenues consist of an underwriting fee healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which in turn are reimbursed and administrative services fees primarily related to claim processing and customer service 

  

in our medicare business the passage of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act or mma in december 2003 demonstrated the federal government’s commitment to providing health 

  

benefits and options to seniors and has started the resurgence of medicare as a business line that should bring us accelerating growth in 2005 and 2006 we already have established medicare private feeforservice plans in eleven new states and recently have received approvals from cms establishing local medicare ppo plans in many of our existing markets where we have established competitive networks medicare private feeforservice plans generally offer additional benefits compared to traditional medicare in exchange for a monthly premium paid by the member these plans typically include a prescription drug benefit with no provider network restrictions local medicare ppo plans typically will offer an even higher level of benefits to members including a prescription drug benefit and a lower level of member costsharing on many benefits while seeking medical services from innetwork providers these products are more fullydescribed beginning on page 6 we continue to evaluate additional states and local markets where we believe we can be competitive with these products and anticipate further expansion during 2005 accordingly we anticipate an organic increase in our medicare advantage enrollment of 10 to 15 during 2005 including the february 2005 acquisition of careplus health plans of florida as more fully described below we anticipate having approximately 470000 to 485000 medicare advantage members at december 31 2005 

  

although still under evaluation we believe we are wellpositioned to participate in medicare regional ppo plans and the medicare prescription drug plan as established by the mma beginning in 2006 in connection herewith we have notified cms of our intent to bid on these programs as a longtime successful participant in the medicare program we believe that we possess 1 the business competencies and management experience with senior product design 2 a robust and scalable multichannel distribution system 3 an established and competitive network including a national retail pharmacy network and 4 an established brand awareness with seniors all of which will enable us to compete for market share in this expanding business line over the next several years 

  

other highlights include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements 

  

recent acquisitions 

  

on february 16 2005 we acquired careplus health plans of florida or careplus as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately 450 million in cash including the acquisition of 

  

approximately 32 million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirements careplus provides medicare advantage hmo plans and benefits to approximately 50000 medicare eligible beneficiaries in miamidade broward and palm beach counties this acquisition enhances our medicare market position in south florida we financed the transaction with 156 million of cash on hand and 294 million of borrowings under our credit agreement the purchase price is subject to a balance sheet settlement process with a nine month claims runout period 

  

on april 1 2004 we acquired ochsner health plan or ochsner from the ochsner clinic foundation for 1571 million in cash ochsner a louisiana health plan added approximately 152600 commercial medical members primarily in fully insured large group accounts and approximately 33100 members in the medicare advantage program this acquisition enabled us to enter a new market with significant market share which should facilitate new sales opportunities in this and surrounding markets including houston texas 

  

these transactions are more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2004 and 2003 

  

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

     

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

   

this table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages 

  

summary 

  

net income was 2800 million or 172 per diluted share in 2004 compared to 2289 million or 141 per diluted share in 2003 the increase in net income consisted of improved profits in both of our business segments driven by higher earnings from our medicare and commercial lines of business the 2003 results included expenses for asset impairments as more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

premium revenues and medical membership 

  

premium revenues increased 73 to 127 billion for 2004 compared to 118 billion for 2003 higher premium revenues resulted primarily from the ochsner acquisition as more fully described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and an increase in medicare advantage and fully insured commercial premium rates items impacting premium rates include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

  

commercial segment premium revenues increased 61 to 70 billion for 2004 compared to 65 billion for 2003 this increase resulted from the ochsner acquisition and increases in per member premiums in the 6 to 8 range on our fully insured commercial business partially offset by membership attrition per member premium increases of 6 to 8 include the impact of an increasing mix of individual products into our fully insured membership a lower premium corresponding to lower benefits on products sold to individuals reduced our composite per member premium trend by approximately 150 to 200 basis points our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 28 or 66300 members to 2286500 at december 31 2004 including the addition of 152600 members from the acquisition of ochsner the decrease is primarily due to the lapse of certain underperforming large group accounts totaling approximately 94000 members in 2004 and continued attrition due to the ongoing competitive environment within the small to midmarket group fullyinsured accounts partially offset by membership gains in the individual product lines we expect fully insured commercial per member premiums to increase in the 65 to 85 range for 2005 including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points from an anticipated higher mix of individual membership 

  

government segment premium revenues increased 88 to 57 billion for 2004 compared to 53 billion for 2003 this increase primarily was attributable to our medicare advantage operations medicare advantage membership was 377200 at december 31 2004 compared to 328600 at december 31 2003 an increase of 48600 members or 148 including 33100 members added through the acquisition of ochsner per member premiums for our medicare advantage business increased in the 9 to 11 range for 2004 reflecting higher reimbursement associated with the mma and including changes associated with the phase in of the risk adjusted payment methodology by cms during 2004 see page 6 for further description of our medicare advantage products and the cms risk adjusted payment methodology for 2005 we expect premium increases per member in the same range of 9 to 11 exclusive of the careplus acquisition and membership growth of approximately 10 to 15 also exclusive of the careplus acquisition including the february 2005 acquisition of careplus we expect medicare advantage enrollment of approximately 470000 to 485000 at december 31 2005 tricare premium revenues decreased 54 in 2004 reflecting the transition to the new south region contract which included a temporary loss of approximately 1 million members for 4 months the tricare contract transition is more fully described on page 8 

  

administrative services fees 

  

our administrative services fees for 2004 were 2728 million an increase of 11 million or 04 from 2717 million for 2003 this increase resulted primarily from higher commercial aso membership partially offset by lower fees related to tricare’s change in governmentcontracted services 

  

for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 432 million or 352 from 1228 million for 2003 to 1660 million for 2004 this increase corresponds to the higher level of aso membership at december 31 2004 which was 1018600 members compared to 712400 at december 31 2003 an increase of 43 

  

administrative services fees for the government segment decreased 421 million or 283 from 1488 million for 2003 to 1068 million for 2004 this decline resulted from the transition to the new south region contract which carved out certain government programs including the administration of pharmacy and medical benefits to senior members over the age of 65 we stopped providing services under these separate programs beginning june 1 2004 

  

investment and other income 

  

investment and other income totaled 1421 million in 2004 an increase of 127 million from 1294 million in 2003 this increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average invested balance partially offset by a decrease in net realized capital gains of approximately 84 million the investment of cash flows from operations contributed to the increase in the average invested balance and added approximately 188 million to interest income the average yield on investment securities was 36 in 2004 compared to 35 in 2003 

  

medical expense 

  

the consolidated mer for 2004 was 841 increasing 60 basis points from 835 for 2003 primarily due to the increase in the mer for the commercial segment 

  

the commercial segment’s mer for 2004 was 839 increasing 100 basis points from 2003 of 829 the 100 basis point increase was primarily due to underwriting losses associated with a large customer account serving approximately 89000 members and a very competitive pricing environment in the 2 to 300 life customer segment the 89000 large group account lapsed on january 1 2005 increasing per member premiums commensurate with claims trend becomes more difficult in a competitive pricing environment fully insured commercial medical cost trends are expected to rise in the range of 65 to 85 for 2005 including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points due to a growing mix of individual membership 

  

the government segment’s mer for 2004 was 843 flat when compared to 2003 the medicare advantage premium increases were consistent with medical cost increases for 2004 reflecting our efforts of adjusting benefit levels commensurate with reimbursement rates 

  

sga expense 

  

the consolidated sga expense ratio for 2004 was 145 decreasing 90 basis points from 154 for 2003 this decrease as well as the decrease in each of our segments’ sga expense ratio is the result of revenue growth in excess of administrative cost inflation and operational efficiencies including gains from completing the consolidation of seven service centers into four during 2003 included in 2003 were costs of 172 million from the impairment of the jacksonville florida service center building more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements these costs increased the 2003 sga expense ratio 10 basis points the consolidated sga expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 135 to 145 for 2005 reflecting the continuing beneficial effect of growth in revenues and membership leveraging fixed costs 

  

the commercial segment sga expense ratio decreased 50 basis points from 169 for 2003 to 164 for 2004 the commercial segment sga expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 10 basis point impact from the jacksonville florida building writedown 

  

  

the government segment sga expense ratio decreased 120 basis points from 134 for 2003 to 122 for 2004 the government segment sga expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 20 basis point impact from the jacksonville florida building writedown 

  

depreciation and amortization for 2004 totaled 1178 million compared to 1268 million for 2003 a decrease of 90 million or 71 accelerated depreciation from reducing the estimated useful life of software increased depreciation expense 93 million in 2004 and 135 million in 2003 we review the carrying value and useful life of software when changes in the use of the asset in our operations indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life changes amortization of other intangible assets decreased when the other intangible assets allocated to an acquired tricare contract became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003 this was partially offset by the increased amortization expense associated with other intangible assets recorded in connection with the april 1 2004 ochsner acquisition 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 232 million for 2004 compared to 174 million for 2003 an increase of 58 million this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of 300 million senior notes in august 2003 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate in 2004 of 327 decreased 09 compared to the 336 effective tax rate in 2003 our effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to taxexempt investment income see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

  

we expect an effective tax rate in 2005 of approximately 30 this is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of a contingent gain during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitation on a tax position related to the 2000 tax year and tax exempt investment income 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2003 and 2002 

  

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

     

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

   

this table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages 

  

summary 

  

net income was 2289 million or 141 per diluted share in 2003 compared to net income of 1428 million or 085 per diluted share in 2002 the increase in earnings resulted primarily from significant improvement in operating earnings for the commercial segment and a decrease in expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items 

  

premium revenues and medical membership 

  

premium revenues increased 82 to 118 billion for 2003 compared to 109 billion for 2002 higher premium revenues resulted primarily from increases in fully insured commercial premium rates and an increase in tricare premiums items impacting premium rates include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

  

commercial segment premium revenues increased 124 to 66 billion for 2003 compared to 58 billion for 2002 this improvement resulted primarily from increases in per member premiums in the 12 to 14 range for 2003 on our fully insured commercial business additionally our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 05 or 12500 members to 2352800 at december 31 2003 compared to 2340300 at december 31 2002 

  

government segment premium revenues increased 33 to 53 billion for 2003 compared to 51 billion for 2002 this increase primarily was attributable to our tricare business partially offset by a reduction in our medicare advantage membership rates were increased upon annual renewal of our base tricare contract and led to an increase in tricare premium revenues of 2483 million or 124 compared to 2002 medicare advantage membership was 328600 at december 31 2003 compared to 344100 at december 31 2002 a decline of 15500 members or 45 this decline resulted as we exited several counties in some of our markets effective january 1 2003 and general attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs per member medicare premiums increased in the 4 to 6 range for 2003 

  

administrative services fees 

  

administrative services fees for 2003 were 2717 million an increase of 273 million from 2444 million for 2002 for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 196 million or 190 to 1228 million this increase corresponds to the higher level of aso membership at december 31 2003 which was 712400 members compared to 652200 members at december 31 2002 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member administrative services fees for the government segment increased 76 million when comparing 2003 to 2002 this increase resulted from contractual adjustments related to tricare for life a program for seniors in which we provided medical benefit administrative services 

  

investment and other income 

  

investment and other income totaled 1294 million in 2003 an increase of 430 million from 864 million in 2002 this increase resulted primarily from an increase in net realized capital gains due to a 152 million gain from the sale of privately held venture capital investments and lower investment impairment losses a result of an improving market we recorded investment impairment losses of 32 million in 2003 compared to 272 million in 2002 higher average invested balances offset lower interest rates the average yield on investment securities was 35 in 2003 declining from 46 in 2002 

  

medical expense 

  

the consolidated mer for 2003 was 835 decreasing 10 basis points from 836 for 2002 

  

the commercial segment mer for 2003 was 829 decreasing 60 basis points from 835 for 2002 the improvement in the mer primarily resulted from per member premium rate increases in excess of medical cost trends for our large group customers and the attrition of groups with higher medical expense ratios 

  

the government segment medical expense ratio for 2003 was 843 increasing 50 basis points from 838 for 2002 this increase primarily was attributable to tricare as a result of having a higher level of revenues from bid price adjustment activity in 2002 

  

sga expense 

  

the consolidated sga expense ratio decreased 50 basis points in 2003 primarily because of a decrease in severance and related employee benefit costs of 290 million the absence of 2002 expenses of 301 million associated with a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items offset by an increase in building impairments of 148 million 

  

increased operating efficiency led to the consolidation of seven service centers into four and an enterprisewide workforce reduction affecting administrative expenses in both 2003 and 2002 by recording expenses for severance and related employee benefit costs and building impairments severance and related employee benefit costs more fully described in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements amounted to 112 million in 2003 and 402 million in 2002 the 2002 severance amount primarily related to the service center consolidation building impairments more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements amounted to 172 million in 2003 and 24 million in 2002 

  

during 2002 we recorded 301 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of physician corporation of america or pca the 301 million of expenses in 2002 resulted from three issues first on january 28 2003 we settled a dispute with a provider for 83 million primarily regarding old claims of pca subsidiaries dating prior to humana’s 1997 acquisition second during the fourth quarter of 2002 as a december 2 2002 trial date approached efforts intensified to reach settlement of an old pca shareholder dispute for periods prior to humana’s 1997 acquisition of pca as a result we accrued 157 million because the loss was probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated we reversed 18 million of this reserve when the final settlement was paid during the third quarter of 2003 third in connection with an agreement reached in november 2002 we partially wroteoff a note receivable of 61 million from the purchaser of our workers’ compensation business which was sold in 2000 the agreement with the purchaser resulted when a significant customer contract was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2002 we acquired the workers’ compensation business in connection with the 1997 pca acquisition 

  

the commercial and government segments’ sga expense ratios likewise were impacted by the same items described previously 

  

depreciation and amortization was 1268 million in 2003 an increase of 61 million or 50 from 1207 million in 2002 the increase results from accelerated depreciation of software in 2003 of 135 million as more fully described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements partially offset by lower amortization related to other intangible assets as costs associated with the government contract acquired with the tricare 2 and 5 transaction became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 174 million in 2003 an increase of 01 million from 173 million in 2002 this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of 300 million senior notes in august 2003 offset by lower interest rates 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate in 2003 of 336 increased 16 compared to the 32 effective tax rate in 2002 the increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a lower proportion of taxexempt investment income to pretax income during 2002 the internal revenue service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately 326 million this was offset by an increase of approximately 245 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate 

  

liquidity 

  

our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums administrative services fees investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments administrative expenses interest expense and taxes purchases of investment securities and capital expenditures and payments on borrowings 

  

cash and cash equivalents decreased to 5801 million at december 31 2004 from 9314 million at december 31 2003 the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 is summarized as follows 

  

   

cash flow from operating activities 

  

our operating cash flows in 2004 were significantly impacted by the timing of the medicare advantage premium remittance which is payable to us on the first day of each month when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday we have historically received this payment at the end of the previous month as such the medicare advantage receipts for january 2004 of 2119 million and january 2003 of 2058 million were received in december 2003 and december 2002 respectively because january 1 is a holiday this timing accounts for a significant portion of the unearned revenues balance on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2003 

  

beginning in 2005 the monthly premium payment schedule includes a change in timing from previous practice as a result of this change the january 2005 payment of 2903 million originally scheduled to be received on friday december 31 2004 was changed to monday january 3 2005 or one business day later therefore we received only 11 monthly medicare advantage premium remittances during 2004 versus 12 monthly premium remittances during 2003 

  

other than the impact from the timing of the medicare advantage premium receipts the increase in net income and cash generated from changes in working capital increased our operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003 the most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and administrative services fees and payments of medical expenses we illustrate these changes with the following summary of receivables and medical and other expenses payable 

  

the detail of total net receivables was as follows at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

tricare base receivables increased in 2004 due to the transition to the reimbursement model under the south region contract beginning on august 1 2004 under our former tricare contracts with a fixed price we bore the cost of changes in the underlying pattern of health care for which the government was at risk until subsequently reimbursed in a later period through a bid price adjustment or bpa process the fixed price and bpa process added variability to our revenues related receivables and operating cash flows because the timing of the settlement was uncertain under the new tricare south region contract the fixed price and bpa process was eliminated and replaced with a new reimbursement model under the new reimbursement model claims paid are reimbursed by the federal government generally within 30 business days the delivery of health care services results in a lag between the time the service is provided and ultimately reimbursed by the federal government typically three months thus tricare receivables are generally collected over a three to four month period likewise tricare medical claims payable are generally paid over the same three to four month period 

  

tricare base receivables increased in 2003 as rates under our base tricare contract increased upon the annual renewal of the contracts for regions 3 and 4 and regions 2 and 5 

  

the detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

      

medical and other expenses payable increased during 2004 and 2003 due primarily to medical claims inflation 

  

changes in other liabilities primarily resulted from the timing of payments for taxes payments related to our tricare contract including subcontractors and general vendor payables 

  

cash flow from investing activities 

  

during 2004 we paid 1418 million to acquire ochsner net of 153 million of cash acquired 

  

we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows at an increasing rate over the last several years in investment securities primarily shortduration fixed income securities totaling 4073 million in 2004 2831 million in 2003 and 179 million in 2002 our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections 

  

medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 1141 million in 2004 1013 million in 2003 and 1121 million in 2002 excluding acquisitions we expect our total capital expenditures in 2005 to be approximately 115 million most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities proceeds from the sale of property and equipment relate primarily to consolidating our service centers in jacksonville and san antonio including the sale of the jacksonville office tower in 2004 for 148 million and a san antonio office building for 59 million in 2003 

  

cash flow from financing activities 

  

we repurchased 38 million common shares for 670 million at an average price of 1783 per share in 2004 37 million common shares for 441 million at an average price of 1203 per share in 2003 and 64 million common shares for 740 million at an average price of 1156 per share in 2002 authorization for additional common share repurchases expired in january 2005 

  

during 2003 we issued 300 million 63 senior notes due august 1 2018 in order to termout our shortterm debt and take advantage of historically low interest rates in addition during 2003 we received proceeds of 316 million in exchange for new swap agreements see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our borrowings and swap agreements 

  

credit agreement 

  

on september 29 2004 we replaced our existing credit agreements with a new 5year 600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement which will expire in september 2009 we previously maintained two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a 265 million 4year revolving credit agreement and a 265 million 364day revolving credit agreement 

  

under the agreement at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion of the agreement bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the spread which varies depending on our credit ratings ranges from 50 to 1125 basis points we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 15 basis points may fluctuate between 125 and 375 basis points depending upon our credit ratings in addition a utilization fee of 125 basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceeds 50 of the total 600 million commitment the competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis at our option 

  

the 5year 600 million credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios at december 31 2004 we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements the terms of this credit agreement also includes standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to humana in the future we have other relationships including financial advisory and banking with some of the parties to the new agreement 

  

the maximum amount available for borrowing under the credit agreement was 5946 million at december 31 2004 reduced from the 600 million due to securing letters of credit of 54 million under the credit agreement no amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit on february 16 2005 we paid approximately 450 million in cash for careplus including approximately 32 million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirement as well as estimated transaction costs we financed the transaction with 156 million of cash on hand and 294 million of borrowings under our credit agreement after the careplus transaction we have 3006 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement 

  

commercial paper program 

  

we maintain and may issue shortterm debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow the program is backed by our credit agreement described above aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreement and commercial paper program generally will not exceed 600 million in connection with the credit arrangement the conduit commercial paper program allowing indirect access to the commercial paper market through a third party was cancelled at december 31 2004 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

  

shelf registration 

  

our universal shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission allows us to register debt or equity securities from time to time with the amount price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale after the issuance of our 300 million 630 senior notes in august 2003 we have up to 300 million remaining from a total of 600 million under the universal shelf registration the universal shelf registration allows us to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes including repayment or refinancing of borrowings working capital capital expenditures investments acquisitions or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 

  

we believe our financial condition is strong and that our cash balances investment securities operating cash flows access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity taken together provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures 

  

however adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2004 was baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s and bbb according to standard  poor’s corporation or sp a downgrade to ba2 or lower by moody’s and bb or lower by sp would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a 300 million notional amount the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap agreement if cancelled we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on december 31 2004 we would have received 121 million net other than the swap agreements adverse changes in our credit ratings may not create increase or accelerate any liabilities 

  

in addition we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions our parent company liquidity improved during 2004 with cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments increasing 399 million to 4393 million at december 31 2004 compared to 3994 million at december 31 2003 see schedule 1 to this form 10k beginning on page 105 for our parent company financial information 

  

regulatory requirements 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

  

as of december 31 2004 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 11855 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 7172 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level certain states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to 

  

monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by all states at december 31 2004 each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have 4056 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2004 as follows 

  

       

indemnifications and guarantees 

  

our operating lease of an airplane which expires january 1 2010 provides for a residual value payment of no more than 48 million at the end of the lease term at the end of the term we have the right to exercise a purchase option or the airplane can be sold to a third party if we decide not to exercise our purchase option we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of 48 million this amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds in excess of 42 million from the sale of the airplane to a third party 

  

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our tricare subsidiaries 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may 

  

include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

  

related parties 

  

no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 26 2005—see “certain transactions with management and others” 

  

market risksensitive financial instruments and positions 

  

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the shortterm duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 

  

we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including among others unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio shifts in the asset mix between taxable and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven times libor was 256 at december 31 2004 our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in libor could not exceed 256 basis points 

  

   

government contracts 

  

our hmo ppo and feeforservice products covered under the medicare advantage contracts with the federal government are renewed for a oneyear term each december 31 unless notice of termination is received at least 90 days prior thereto no termination notices were received in connection with our currently existing contracts in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act or mma was signed into law we believe mma offers new opportunities in our medicare programs including our hmo ppo and private feeforservice products we have made additional investments in the medicare advantage program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs 

  

our tricare south region contract which we were awarded in 2003 covers approximately 29 million beneficiaries the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense the contract is for a fiveyear period subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with the second option period scheduled to begin april 1 2005 

  

we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june 30 2005 our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois and are annual contracts as of december 31 2004 puerto rico accounted for approximately 83 of our total medicaid membership 

  

the loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

legal proceedings 

  

we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business including employment matters breach of contract actions tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” of item 3 in part 1 we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters in addition recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

medical expense recognition 

  

medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows 

  

   

estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results from operations and overall financial position for example a 100 basis point or 1 percent change in the 

  

estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at december 31 2004 which represents approximately 40 of total liabilities would require an adjustment of approximately 14 million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known 

  

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns as well as historical medical cost trends depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels product mix and weekday seasonality 

  

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation 

  

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes increases in medical services capacity direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services an aging population catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends internal factors such as system conversions claims processing cycle times changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months additionally we continually prepare and review followup studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time the results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

  

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2004 data 

  

    

   

most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 2 of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than 12 months as such we expect that substantially all of the 2004 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2005 

  

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

  

ibnr established in connection with our tricare contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than for our other operations because there are more variables that impact the estimate these variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions many of these variables are impacted significantly by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the united states armed forces additionally we transitioned to the new tricare south region contract during the latter half of 2004 accordingly our historical claims experience and familiarity with claim payment patterns for this block of business is not as mature as our other lines of business we have considered all of these factors in establishing our ibnr estimate each of these factors required significant judgment by management 

  

as more fully described on page 45 our tricare contract contains risksharing provisions with the department of defense and with subcontractors which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid as a result of these contract provisions the impact of changes in estimates for prior year tricare medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially whether positive or negative 

  

as more fully described on pages 10 and 11 we have a substantial percentage of our medicare and medicaid membership under risksharing arrangements with providers accordingly the impact of changes in estimates for prior year medical claims payable on our results from operations that are attributable to our medicare and medicaid lines of business may also be significantly reduced whether positive or negative 

  

the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development positive amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated unfavorable development 

  

as summarized in the previous table claim reserve balances at december 31 2003 ultimately settled during 2004 for 935 million less than the amounts originally estimated representing 09 of medical claim expenses incurred in 2003 during 2003 claim reserve balances at december 31 2002 ultimately settled for 761 million less than the amounts originally estimated representing 08 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2002 this 174 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years resulted primarily from favorable development in our medicare line of business as a result of better than expected utilization in the latter half of 2003 the substantial majority of this favorable development in the medicare business occurred under risksharing arrangements with providers which resulted in minimizing the impact on our reported 2004 results from operations 

  

during 2002 claim reserve balances at december 31 2001 ultimately settled for 123 million more than the amounts originally recorded representing 01 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2001 the 884 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years during 2003 consists of 683 million attributable to our tricare operations with the remaining 201 million primarily resulting from fourth quarter 2002 utilization in our commercial medical products ultimately being lower than originally estimated the 683 million change in tricare incurred related to prior years resulted from establishing medical expense reserves resulting from enhanced benefits enacted for tricare beneficiaries as a result of congressional legislation as well as lower than originally estimated utilization of medical services by tricare beneficiaries in the second half of 2002 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generally establish oneyear contracts with commercial employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group’s 30day written notice our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our medicare advantage contracts with the federal government which renew annually our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage except for tricare contracts discussed in the following section our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items 

  

such as age working status or specific health issues of the member changes in revenues from cms for our medicare advantage products resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 

  

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group an individual or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are estimated based on historical trends we monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

  

we bill and collect premium and aso fee remittances from employer groups the federal and state governments and individual medicare advantage members monthly premium and aso fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 

  

tricare contract 

  

in 2004 tricare revenues represented 17 of total premiums and administrative services fees the single tricare contract for the south region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components tricare revenues consist generally of 1 an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian healthcare services delivered to eligible beneficiaries 2 healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government and 3 administrative service fees related to claim processing customer service enrollment disease management and other services we recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health care services are provided administrative service fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed 

  

the tricare contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits annually we negotiate a target healthcare cost amount or target cost with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee any variance from the target cost is shared we earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost we receive 20 for any cost underrun subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10 of the target cost we pay 20 for any cost overrun subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4 of the target cost a final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies we defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured we estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in medical expenses 

  

the tricare contract contains provisions to negotiate change orders change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

  

our former tricare contracts for regions 3 and 4 and regions 2 and 5 which expired during 2004 contained provisions for not only change orders but for bid price adjustments or bpas as well there are no provisions for bpas in our current tricare contract bpas were utilized to retroactively adjust revenues for 

  

the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk including the risks associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities or mtfs change in the number of persons eligible for tricare benefits and medical unit cost inflation we work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and mtf workload data and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual bpa requirements final settlement of bpas occurs only at specified intervals typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year we record revenues applicable to bpas when these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

  

investment securities 

  

investment securities totaled 24941 million or 44 of total assets at december 31 2004 debt securities totaled 24520 million or 98 of our total investment portfolio more than 94 of our debt securities were of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by standard  poor’s at december 31 2004 most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end bb or better of the noninvestment grade spectrum our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

  

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 33 years at december 31 2004 based on this duration a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately 80 million 

  

our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices nontraded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately held or where an observable quoted market price does not exist are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows unrealized holding gains and losses net of applicable deferred taxes are included as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized from a sale or impairment 

  

gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december 31 2004 included the following 

  

   

we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment we consider factors affecting the investee factors affecting the industry the investee operates within and general debt and equity market trends we consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value the near term prospects for 

  

recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment 

  

unrealized losses at december 31 2004 resulted from 254 positions from a total of 797 positions held less than 4 of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year the unrealized losses at december 31 2004 generally can be attributed to changes in interest rates all issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities after taking into account these and other factors including our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary 

  

there were no impairment losses recorded in 2004 we recorded impairment losses of 32 million in 2003 and 272 million in 2002 after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary 

  

goodwill and longlived assets 

  

at december 31 2004 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 23 of total assets and 63 of total stockholders’ equity 

  

statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we not amortize goodwill to earnings but instead that we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments the commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of fully and selfinsured medical and specialty the government segment’s three reporting units consist of medicare advantage tricare and medicaid goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 

  

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios we used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weightedaverage cost of capital key assumptions including changes in membership premium yields medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss 

  

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other finitelived intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation for these assets we recognized losses due to 

  

impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of 93 million in 2004 308 million in 2003 and 24 million in 2002 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51  or fin 46 the primary objectives of fin 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary in december 2003 the fasb issued fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb 51 revised december 2003  which amended certain provisions of fin 46 and delayed implementation for entities that are not considered special purpose entities until the first quarter of 2004 

  

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2004 we are not involved in any spe transactions the adoption of fin 46 or fin 46r did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement no 123r sharebased payment  or statement 123r which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stockbased compensation this requirement represents a significant change because fixedbased stock option awards a predominate form of stock compensation for us were not recognized as compensation expense under apb 25 statement 123r requires the cost of the award as determined on the date of grant at fair value be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period the grantdate fair value of the award will be estimated using optionpricing models we are required to adopt statement 123r no later than july 1 2005 under one of three transition methods including a prospective retrospective and combination approach we disclose on page 67 the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the blackscholes pricing model for 2004 2003 and 2002 we currently are evaluating all of the provisions of statement 123r and the expected effect on us including among other items reviewing compensation strategies related to stockbased awards selecting an option pricing model and determining the transition method 

  

in march 2004 the fasb issued eitf issue no 031 or eitf 031 the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf 031 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its carrying value in september 2004 the fasb delayed the previously scheduled third quarter 2004 effective date until the issuance of additional implementation guidance expected in 2005 upon issuance of a final standard we will evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

  

cautionary statements 

  

this document includes both historical and forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements are made within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 we intend such forwardlooking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events trends and uncertainties these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things the information discussed below in making these 

  

statements we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results our business is highly complicated regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 

  

if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate our profitability could decline 

  

we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record medical claims reserves for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however increases in the use or cost of services by our members competition government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 

  

these factors may include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively our membership and profitability could decline 

  

we are in a highly competitive industry many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition 

  

other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicare advantage program and in consumerdirected health plans such as health savings accounts “hsa” we believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices factors such as business consolidations strategic alliances legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases despite being faced with increasing medical costs the commercial pricing environment particularly in the 2 to 300 member groups is extremely competitive and several of our competitors including public and notforprofit companies are pricing aggressively to gain market share 

  

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationship with our providers in various markets among other issues could also affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of or entrance to medicare advantage or commercial markets 

  

to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to managed care plans cms has implemented a risk adjustment model that uses diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings hospital outpatient department and physician visits cms has also redesigned its data collection and processing system to reduce administrative data burden on medicare health plans in 2004 the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 30 percent from 10 percent in 2003 the 100 phasein of risk adjusted payment will be completed in 2007 the portion of risk adjusted payment will increase to 50 percent in 2005 and 75 percent in 2006 

  

under the new risk adjustment methodology humana and all managed care organizations must collect capture and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year as a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology described above our cms monthly payments per member may change materially either favorably or unfavorably 

  

if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect or if it declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future this strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business with emphasis on our aso and individual products introduction of new products and benefit designs including our smart consumerchoice products opportunities created with the new medicare advantage products the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts we believe that by combining our abilities in product design clinical programs and consumer engagement we can achieve cost savings for our customers and our company there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted failure to implement this strategy or to contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 

  

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors a change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

  

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully our financial results could suffer 

  

in general prescription drug costs have been rapidly rising over the past few years these increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brandname drugs and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes in order to control prescription drug costs we have implemented multitiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs including our fourtiered copayment benefit design rx4 and an rx allowance program organized by evidence based impact we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

  

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions and tort claims 

  

we together with some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits these include an action originally filed against us and nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers two companies have now settled this action this suit alleges breaches of federal statutes including erisa and rico depending upon the outcome of these cases these lawsuits may cause or force changes in the practices of the managed care industry 

  

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act rico and other statutes may be sought while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our selfinsurance however some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

  

a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

  

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs including the tricare medicare advantage and medicaid programs these programs involve various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 

  

the health care industry in general and health insurance particularly health maintenance organizations or hmos and preferred provider organizations or ppos are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

state regulations require our licensed operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities additionally those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments loans loan repayments or other payments to us 

  

in recent years significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

all of these proposals could apply to us 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 

  

the national association of insurance commissioners or naic has adopted riskbased capital requirements also known as rbc which is subject to statebystate adoption and to the extent implemented sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and hmo companies the naic recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for hmos has been adopted in most states in which we operate the hmo rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries 

  

the use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data most are derived from the privacy provisions in the 

  

federal grammleachbliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 

  

regulations issued in february 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april 21 2005 violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 

  

another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days however due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards procedures and penalties we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices the providersponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our company to additional liability and penalties 

  

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations these can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general cms the office of the inspector general of health and human services the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor the defense contract audit agency and state departments of insurance and departments of health several attorneys general are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers including those of certain of the companies in the health care industry all of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs or the imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

  

if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business could be adversely affected 

  

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

  

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may in some cases compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

  

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members ie capitation the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with 

  

whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

  

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

  

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc the parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 

  

debt ratings are an important factor in our competitive position 

  

claims paying ability financial strength and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers and our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such downgrades in our ratings should they occur may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

  

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the company including its consolidated subsidiaries is made known to members of senior management and the board of directors 

  

based on our evaluation as of december 31 2004 we as the principal executive officer the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer of the company have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported as specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

we assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  based on our assessment we determined that as of december 31 2004 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see the “cautionary statements” section in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results 

  

business segments 

  

we manage our business with two segments commercial and government the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines 

  

of business fully insured medical administrative services only or aso and specialty the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicarechoice medicaid and tricare we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

  

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

  

strategy 

  

our business strategy centers on increasing commercial segment profitability while building on our existing strength in the government segment and exploring opportunities under the recently enacted medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act or dima our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumerchoice product designs which are supported by service excellence and industryleading electronic capabilities including education tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet the intent of our commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional experience for both employers and members in order to achieve a high degree of consumer satisfaction and loyalty 

  

our products 

  

the following table presents our segment membership premiums and aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

   

our products marketed to commercial segment employers and members 

  

new generation of products 

  

we have developed a range of innovative products styled as “smart” products that we believe will be a solution for employers who annually are facing doubledigit premium increases driven by medical cost inflation our new generation of products provide more 1 choices for the individual consumer 2 transparency of provider costs and 3 benefit designs that engage consumers in the costs and effectiveness of health care choices innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions including the tradeoffs between higher premiums and pointofservice costs at the time consumers choose their plans and to suggest ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans these products are sold to employers with humana as the sole carrier but are available on either a fully insured or selffunded basis as of december 31 2003 we had enrolled approximately 130000 members into our smart products 

  

many of our smart products as well as our more traditional products are offered to employer groups as “bundles” where the subscribers are offered various hmo and ppo options with various employer contribution strategies as determined by the customer 

  

hmo 

  

our health maintenance organization or hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include among others hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician generally must approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is considered the most restrictive form of managed care 

  

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician for the year ended december 31 2003 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 29 billion or 237 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

ppo 

  

our preferred provider organization or ppo products which are marketed primarily to commercial groups and individuals include some elements of managed health care however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos also are similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees 

  

in june 2002 we introduced humanaone a major medical product marketed directly to individuals we introduced this product in select markets where we can utilize our existing networks and distribution channels 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 commercial and individual ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 34 billion or 279 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

administrative services only 

  

we offer an administrative services only or aso product to those who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo and hmo products described above however under aso contracts selffunded employers retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits for the year ended december 31 2003 commercial aso fees totaled 1228 million or 10 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

specialty products 

  

we also offer various specialty products including dental group life and shortterm disability at december 31 2003 we had approximately 17 million specialty members for the year ended december 31 2003 specialty product premium revenues were approximately 3202 million or 27 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

our products marketed to government segment members and beneficiaries 

  

medicarechoice product 

  

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons certain hospital and medical insurance benefits which include hospitalization benefits for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days each medicareeligible individual is entitled to receive inpatient hospital care known as part a care without the payment of any premium but is required to pay a premium to the federal government which is adjusted annually to be eligible for physician care and other services known as part b care 

  

we contract with cms under the medicarechoice program to provide health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member for medicareeligible individuals residing in the geographic areas in which our hmos operate individuals who elect to participate in medicarechoice programs receive additional benefits not covered by medicare and are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the deductible or coinsurance amounts but are generally required to use exclusively the services provided by the hmo subject to nominal copayments and coinsurance and are required to pay a part b premium to the medicare program 

  

the medicarechoice product involves a contract between an hmo and cms pursuant to which cms makes a fixed monthly payment to the hmo on behalf of each medicareeligible individual that chooses to enroll for coverage in the hmo the fixed monthly payment payable on the first day of a month is determined by formula established by federal law we sometimes receive the fixed monthly payment early due to a weekend or holiday falling on the first day of a month since this amount is significant the timing of its receipt can cause a material fluctuation in our operating cash flows from period to period we also collect additional member premiums from our members in most of our markets 

  

at december 31 2003 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 328600 medicarechoice members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 25 billion or 209 of our total premiums and aso fees for 2003 one such cms contract covered approximately 229100 members in florida and accounted for premium revenues of approximately 18 billion which represented 705 of our medicarechoice premium revenues or 147 of our total premiums and aso fees for 2003 

  

our medicarechoice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a oneyear term each december 31 unless terminated 90 days prior thereto annual increases in per member premiums from cms have ranged from as low as approximately 2 to as high as approximately 10 with an average of 

  

approximately 5 for the fiveyear period beginning january 1 2000 over the last several years our medicarechoice membership has declined as we exited some counties these exits were a result in part of lower cms reimbursement rates 

  

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or dima was signed into law the legislation establishes a new medicare private health plan program called medicareadvantage continuing the health plan options afforded under the former medicarechoice program while adding additional health plan options including regional ppo options beginning in 2006 dima includes provisions that require the 2004 stabilization funding to be directed toward increased reimbursement for providers increased benefits or access for members or decreased member premiums including dima funding and changes in member premiums we expect an 8 to 10 increase in total per member premiums in 2004 with a corresponding increase in medical costs due to increased reimbursements for providers and increased benefits for members 

  

medicaid product 

  

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to lowincome residents each electing state develops through a state specific regulatory agency a medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders who apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state generally is for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

  

we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june 30 2005 subject to each party agreeing upon annual rates in july 2003 we signed amendments to the puerto rico medicaid contracts regarding a premium rate increase for the annual period ending june 30 2004 our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois and are annual contracts for the year ended december 31 2003 premium revenues from our medicaid products totaled 4871 million or 40 of our total premiums and aso fees at december 31 2003 we had approximately 394800 medicaid members in puerto rico or 84 of total medicaid members and 74100 medicaid members in florida and illinois or 16 of total medicaid members 

  

tricare 

  

tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents in november 1995 the united states department of defense awarded us our first tricare contract for regions 3 and 4 covering approximately 11 million eligible beneficiaries in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee and eastern louisiana on july 1 1996 we began providing health insurance coverage to these approximately 11 million eligible beneficiaries 

  

on may 31 2001 we purchased the entity responsible for administering tricare benefits for regions 2 and 5 to approximately 12 million eligible beneficiaries in illinois indiana kentucky michigan north carolina ohio tennessee virginia wisconsin west virginia and a portion of missouri 

  

our current tricare contract with the department of defense will be in effect until april 30 2004 for regions 2 and 5 and until june 30 2004 for regions 3 and 4 each of the contracts is subject to a oneyear renewal at the government’s option we believe these contracts will continue until the tricare transition described below 

  

on august 21 2003 the department of defense notified us that we were awarded the contract for the south region one of three newlycreated regions under the government’s revised tricare program the current tricare regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new south region along with region 6 which is currently administered by another contractor the current regions 2 and 5 will become part of the north region which was awarded to another contractor 

  

pursuant to the department of defense’s bid process each of the three awards was subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders of prime contracts however none of the protests were successful 

  

under the department of defense’s current schedule for implementation of the new tricare contracts regions 2 and 5 will transition to the new north region for the start of healthcare delivery on july 1 2004 regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on august 1 2004 and region 6 will become part of our new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on november 1 2004 if this schedule is realized our tricare membership is expected to temporarily decline to 15 million in july 2004 and is expected to increase to 28 million in november 2004 this will also result in a decline in revenues during this period 

  

in addition retail pharmacy benefits for tricare beneficiaries will be administered separately under the new department of defense tricare retail pharmacy program on september 26 2003 we were notified that we were not awarded the retail pharmacy contract and later that our protest of this award decision was not upheld 

  

currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in an hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers we have subcontracted with third parties to provide various administration and specialty services under the contracts for the year ended december 31 2003 tricare premium revenues were approximately 22 billion or 186 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

at december 31 2003 we had 1057200 tricare aso beneficiaries for which the department of defense retains the risk of financing the cost of their health benefits we obtained these beneficiaries from our acquisition of regions 2 and 5 and by enrollment in two government programs that allow senior beneficiaries to continue in the tricare program even after becoming medicare eligible which normally is age 65 the first of these programs called tricare senior pharmacy became effective april 1 2001 under this government administrative services program senior tricare beneficiaries receive certain pharmacy benefits not covered under medicare on october 1 2001 the tricare for life program expanded coverage to include medical benefits as well for the year ended december 31 2003 tricare administrative services fees totaled 1488 million or 12 of our total premiums and aso fees once the department of defense’s new contracting structure is implemented our responsibility for both of these programs will cease the tricare senior pharmacy program is intended to become part of the previously mentioned tricare retail pharmacy program the tricare for life program will become the tricare dualeligible fiscal intermediary contract tdefic the tdefic contract for which we did not bid was awarded to another contractor on july 25 2003 it will become effective when the current regional contracts expire 

  

we do not believe that these tricare contract changes occurring during 2004 will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

the following table summarizes our total medical membership at december 31 2003 by market and product 

  

   

provider arrangements 

  

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities we have approximately 463300 contracts with health care providers participating in our networks which consist of approximately 294400 physicians 3300 hospitals and 165600 ancillary providers and dentists these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

  

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems or hims and enrolling members into various disease management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our medicarechoice and hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract provides services and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of quality patient care are met our hims programs use speciallytrained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo member’s medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the member’s discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal 

  

and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes and breast cancer screening we also may focus on certain rare conditions where disease management techniques benefit members in a more cost effective manner 

  

we typically contract with hospitals on either a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day a case rate which is an allinclusive rate per admission or at a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services generally are contracted at a flat rate by type of service or at a discounted charge these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers typically are contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationallyrecognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

  

our contracts with physicians typically are automatically renewed each year unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

  

capitation 

  

for 71 of our december 31 2003 medical membership we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from 82 to 89 providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

  

for 64 of our december 31 2003 medical membership we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

  

physicians under capitation arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

medical membership under these various arrangements was as follows at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

   

capitation expense as a percentage of total medical expense was as follows for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

accreditation assessment 

  

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs such as those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies and external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate hmos based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

  

physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or jcaho 

  

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical license review of their malpractice liability claims history review of their board certification if applicable and review of any complaints including any member appeals and grievances committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

  

we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commissionutilization review accreditation commission or aahcurac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo accreditation specific to the utilization review process is also required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by united auto workers contracts and those where the request comes from the employer require or prefer accredited health plans 

  

ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management and member rights and responsibilities we continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through ncqa two markets maintain ncqa accredited status for all hmo products humana health plan of ohio inc in cincinnati ohio excellent and humana health plan inc kentucky commendable humana health plan inc in kansas and missouri completed the ncqa survey process in november 2003 and awaits its decision 

  

aahcurac performs reviews of standards for utilization management and for health plan standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management several markets have achieved urac health plan accreditation for all hmo products humana medical plan inc in north florida south florida central florida daytona tampa and orlando and humana health plan inc in kansas the atlanta market has urac utilization management accreditation for hmo and ppo product lines aahcurac utilization management accreditation was received by humana military healthcare services inc which administers the tricare program and for the green bay service center 

  

some of our hmo entities are unaccredited because we sought accreditation only where regulatory requirements were in place such as in florida which requires accreditation for hmo licensing or in market areas where commercial groups use it as part of the criteria for choosing carriers we are piloting iso 90012000 certification as an alternative to accreditation iso is the international standards organization which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process called iso 90012000 at this time the following clinical programs have received iso registration transplant management centralized clinical operations providing personal nurse services pharmacy management and disease management 

  

sales and marketing 

  

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the 

  

premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of the employees or members beginning in june 2002 we also offer health insurance products to individuals 

  

we use various methods to market our commercial medicarechoice and medicaid products including television radio the internet telemarketing and direct mailings at december 31 2003 we used approximately 38000 licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 220 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume 

  

at december 31 2003 we employed approximately 1280 sales representatives who are each paid a salary andor per member commission to market our medicarechoice and medicaid products in the continental united states we also employed approximately 380 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicarechoice and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members 

  

risk management 

  

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group reform laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

  

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with medicarechoice products because cms regulations require us to accept all eligible medicare applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history we also are not permitted to employ underwriting criteria for the medicaid product but rather we follow cms and state requirements in addition with respect to our tricare business we do not employ any underwriting techniques because we must accept all eligible beneficiaries who choose to participate 

  

competition 

  

the health benefits industry is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid or renewed annually our competitors vary by local market and include other managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers is or may be influenced by such factors as benefits pricing contract terms number and quality of participating physicians and other providers utilization review claims processing administrative efficiency relationships with agents quality of customer service and accreditation results 

  

government regulation 

  

government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results also it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal 

  

and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 

  

enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation’s law enforcement entities the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicarechoice medicaid and the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs the programs are subject to very technical rules when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 

  

we are subject to various governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions these include possible government actions relating to the employee retirement income security act as amended or erisa fehbp federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other laws relating to medicarechoice including adjusted community rating development special payment status and various other areas adjusted community rating development is the governmentdefined rating formula used to explain the medicarechoice benefits we offer individuals eligible for medicare benefits based on a particular community and certain other factors special payment status refers to among others medicarechoice members who are institutionalized medicaideligible or members who have contracted endstage renal disease the medicarechoice plan receives a higher payment for members who qualify for one or more of these statuses we are currently involved in various government investigations audits and reviews some of which are under erisa and others under the authority of various states’ departments of insurance on may 31 2000 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general for the department of health and human services as part of a settlement of a medicare overpayment issue arising from an audit by the office of the inspector general although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties and other sanctions against us including exclusion from participation in government programs we do not believe the results of any of these actions individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

of our seven licensed and active hmo subsidiaries as of february 1 2004 five are qualified under the federal health maintenance organization act of 1973 as amended to obtain federal qualification an hmo must meet certain requirements including conformance with benefit rating and financial reporting standards 

  

as of february 1 2004 humana medical plan inc humana health plan of texas inc and humana health plan inc each hold cms contracts under the medicarechoice program to sell medicare hmo products in a total of seven states in addition humana insurance company holds cms contracts under a medicarechoice program to sell a private feeforservice product in eleven states and a pilot ppo product in three counties in florida 

  

cms conducts audits of hmos qualified under its medicarechoice program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations these audits include review of the hmos’ administration and management including management information and data collection systems fiscal stability utilization management and physician incentive arrangements health services delivery quality assurance marketing enrollment and disenrollment activity claims processing and complaint systems 

  

cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements in addition cms requires certain disclosures to cms and to medicarechoice beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan contracted under the medicarechoice program cms’s rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between an hmo and physicians in the hmos’ networks these rules also require certain levels of stoploss coverage to protect contracted physicians 

  

against major losses relating to patient care depending on the amount of financial risk they assume the reporting of certain health care data contained in hedis is another important cms disclosure requirement 

  

our medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a medicaid product and by the health insurance administration in puerto rico in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies the reviews are similar in nature to those performed by cms 

  

laws in the commonwealth of puerto rico and each of the states in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including the scope of benefits rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance and our hmos are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health most states’ laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years 

  

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and commonwealth of puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company require minimum levels of equity and limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

  

as of december 31 2003 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 10865 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 6404 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level certain states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by all states at december 31 2003 each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have 3819 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 

  

one tricare subsidiary under the regions 3 and 4 contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities we were in compliance with this requirement at december 31 2003 

  

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business 

  

health care reform 

  

there continue to be diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation’s health care system 

  

federal 

  

on december 8 2003 president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 or dima dima makes many significant changes to the medicare feeforservice and medicarechoice programs as well as other changes to the commercial health insurance marketplace most significantly dima creates a prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries establishes a new medicare advantage program to replace the medicarechoice program and enacts health savings accounts or hsas for nonmedicare eligible individuals and groups 

  

in 2004 and 2005 older americans will be eligible to purchase a discount card lowincome seniors also will receive an annual subsidy of 600 to further defray drug costs distribution of the discount cards is expected in march or april 2004 beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries will be able to sign up for a standalone drug plan or join a private health plan that offers drug coverage dima adds a new payment methodology for private medicareadvantage plans in 2004 this methodology provides another basis of payment equal to 100 of medicare feeforservice costs and changes the 2 minimum update to include the greater of 2 or the medicareadvantage growth rate 

  

the legislation establishes a new medicare private health plan program called medicareadvantage to offer regional ppo options beginning in 2006 and a continuance of hmo pointofservice ppo those established prior to december 31 2005 and privatefeeforservice options in defined local service areas 

  

the legislation also includes a provision establishing hsa’s taxadvantaged savings accounts that can be used to pay for medical expenses incurred by individuals their spouse and their dependents 

  

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules we have made significant systems enhancements and invested in new technological solutions the compliance and enforcement date for standard transactions and code sets rules was october 16 2003 we have continued to be in compliance with this regulation however as many providers indicated that they could not yet comply cms stated that covered entities making a good faith effort to comply with hipaa transactions and codeset standards would be allowed to implement contingency plans to maintain their operations and cash flows on october 15 2003 we announced implementation of a contingency plan to accept noncompliant electronic transactions from our providers we will continue to accept and process transactions sent in prehipaa electronic formats from providers who are showing a goodfaith effort until all providers and clearinghouses are capable of transmitting fully compliant standards transactions as defined in the hipaa implementation guidelines or until cms begins enforcement of the hipaa electronic data interchange regulations we believe that the implementation of our contingency plans has minimized any disruptions in our business operations during this transition however if entities with which we do business do not ultimately comply with the hipaa transactions and code set standards it could result in disruptions of certain of our business operations 

  

in addition congress is evaluating proposals to include establishing additional protections for personal health information tax credits for the uninsured proposals to reduce the number of medical errors by health care providers and systems of care and various state and federal purchasing plans to allow individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance many of these proposals may require additional administrative costs to ensure compliance and we are currently assessing their cost and impact on premiums for the future 

  

state 

  

we continue to encounter regulation on health care claims payment practices at the state level this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties supplemental legislation includes among other provisions claims submission content and electronic submission 

  

we view electronic submission as a favorable development that will simplify claims interactions a few states are considering proposals that place new limits on insurer contacts with hospitals and physicians these proposals include provisions to expand payment disclosure limit implementation of claims payment procedures and extend an insurer payment liability where intermediaries fail to pay and restrict recoupment 

  

some states are proposing the creation of small employer pooled purchasing arrangements although these pooled purchasing arrangements may affect the small group market most of the proposals require these purchasing arrangements to comply with the standard small group market regulations similar arrangements enacted in the early 1990s had a very limited affect on the small group insurance market a limited number of states are considering additional restrictions on the use of health status in small group rating mandatefree benefit plans are pending in a number of states some of these proposals could allow insurers more flexibility in the use of member cost sharing there is activity in some states supporting an expansion of disclosure by hospitals physicians and other health care providers of quality and charge data either directly to patients or to state agencies that must make it publicly available 

  

medical malpractice reform is receiving significant attention pending medical malpractice reform proposals differ substantially relative to the entities covered by the reforms since the substance of the reforms remains under discussion and the scope of covered entities has not been resolved in most states management is unable to predict future activity under these laws 

  

we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

other 

  

captive insurance company 

  

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain these risks through our whollyowned consolidated insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to our own general business risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third party insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses in an effort to minimize credit risk we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings on january 1 2002 and again on january 1 2003 we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates we provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities related to our captive insurance subsidiary in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

securities litigation 

  

in late 1997 three purported class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida by former stockholders of physician corporation of america or pca against pca and certain of its former directors and officers we acquired pca by a merger that became effective on september 8 1997 the three actions were consolidated into a single action entitled in re physician corporation of america securities litigation the consolidated complaint alleged that pca and the individual defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings with respect to the financial and regulatory difficulties of pca’s workers’ compensation business the court certified a class on may 20 2003 on august 25 2003 the parties entered into an agreement to settle the case for the amount of 102 million on november 26 2003 the settlement received final approval by the court a provision for the settlement was previously made in our financial statements during the fourth quarter of 2002 the company had pursued insurance coverage for this matter from two insurers and has settled the matter with one of the insurers who will pursue coverage against the other insurer 

  

managed care industry purported class action litigation 

  

we have been involved in several purported class action lawsuits that are part of a wave of generally similar actions that target the health care payer industry and particularly target managed care companies these include a lawsuit against us and nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of physicians who have 

  

treated our members as a result of action by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation “jpml” the case was consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and has been styled in re managed care litigation 

  

the plaintiffs assert that we and other defendants improperly paid providers’ claims and “downcoded” their claims by paying lesser amounts than they submitted the complaint alleges among other things multiple violations under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico as well as various breaches of contract and violations of regulations governing the timeliness of claim payments we moved to dismiss the complaint on september 8 2000 and the other defendants filed similar motions thereafter on march 2 2001 the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to the defendants’ several motions to dismiss however the court allowed the plaintiffs to attempt to correct the deficiencies in their complaint with an amended pleading with respect to all of the allegations except a claim under the federal medicare regulations which was dismissed with prejudice the court also left undisturbed the plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract on march 26 2001 the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint which among other things added four state or county medical associations as additional plaintiffs two of those the denton county medical society and the texas medical association purport to bring their actions against us as well as against several other defendant companies the medical association of georgia and the california medical association purport to bring their actions against various other defendant companies the associations seek injunctive relief only the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on april 30 2001 

  

on september 26 2002 the court granted the plaintiffs’ request to file a second amended complaint adding additional plaintiffs including the florida medical association which purports to bring its action against all defendants on october 21 2002 the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint on december 8 2003 the court denied the motion 

  

also on september 26 2002 the court certified a global class consisting of all medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by any defendant from august 4 1990 to september 26 2002 the class includes two subclasses a national subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by a defendant when the doctor has a claim against such defendant and is not required to arbitrate that claim a california subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured in california by any defendant when the doctor was not bound to arbitrate the claim 

  

on october 10 2002 the defendants asked the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to review the class certification decision on november 20 2002 the court of appeals agreed to review the class issue the appellate court heard oral argument on september 11 2003 but no ruling has been issued discovery is ongoing and the court has set a trial date of september 13 2004 also on january 15 2004 the court filed a notice with the jpml that will permit the jpml to decide whether the case should remain in miami florida for trial or be separately remanded for trial to the courts in which the actions were filed prior to their transfer to and consolidation in miami florida in the case of the company that would be the united states district court for the western district of kentucky in the meantime two of the defendants aetna inc and cigna corporation have entered into settlement agreements which have been approved by the court 

  

we intend to continue to defend this action vigorously 

  

other 

  

the academy of medicine of cincinnati the butler county medical society the northern kentucky medical society and several physicians filed antitrust suits in state courts in ohio and kentucky against aetna health inc humana health plan of ohio inc anthem blue cross blue shield and united healthcare of ohio inc alleging that the defendants violated the ohio and kentucky antitrust laws by conspiring to fix the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the greater cincinnati and northern kentucky region each suit sought class certification damages and injunctive relief plaintiffs cited no evidence that any such conspiracy existed 

  

but based their allegations on assertions that physicians in the greater cincinnati region are paid less than physicians in other major cities in ohio and kentucky 

  

on october 23 2003 we entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs that specified an increase in future reimbursement we pay to a class consisting of physicians in a 12county area in southern ohio and northern kentucky over the next three years we agreed to increase the reimbursement in the aggregate subject to certain contingencies that will increase the amounts paid for physician services over the amounts paid in 2003 as follows 20 million in 2004 an additional 15 million in 2005 and an additional 10 million in 2006 the agreement also provides for a committee to monitor our contracting practices for the period 2007 through 2010 with reporting to us if any anticompetitive behavior is believed to have occurred the agreement was approved by the courts on december 30 2003 

  

government audits and other litigation and proceedings 

  

in july 2000 the office of the florida attorney general initiated an investigation apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the managed care industry purported class action litigation described above on september 21 2001 the texas attorney general initiated a similar investigation no actions have been filed against us by either state these investigations are ongoing and we have cooperated with the regulators in both states 

  

on may 31 2000 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement or cia with the office of inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services under the cia we are obligated to among other things provide training conduct periodic audits and make periodic reports to the oig 

  

in addition our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities there has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the managed health care companies’ business practices including claims payment practices and utilization management practices we have been and continue to be subject to such reviews some of these have resulted in fines and could require changes in some of our practices and could also result in additional fines or other sanctions 

  

we also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations including claims of medical malpractice bad faith nonacceptance or termination of providers failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements as well as challenges to subrogation practices we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers members and others including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 

  

in addition several courts including several federal appellate courts recently have issued decisions which have the effect of eroding the scope of erisa preemption for employersponsored health plans thereby exposing us to greater liability for medical negligence claims this includes decisions which hold that plans may be liable for medical negligence claims in some situations based solely on medical necessity decisions made in the course of adjudicating claims in addition some courts have issued rulings which make it easier to hold plans liable for medical negligence on the part of network providers on the theory that providers are agents of the plans and that the plans are therefore vicariously liable for the injuries to members by providers 

  

personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted in addition insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future on january 1 2002 and again on january 1 2003 we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates 

  

we do not believe that any pending or threatened legal actions against us or any pending or threatened audits or investigations by state or federal regulatory agencies will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits like the purported class action lawsuits described above or governmental investigations cannot be accurately predicted with certainty in addition the potential for increased liability for medical negligence arising from claims adjudication along with the increased litigation that has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry adds to this uncertainty therefore such legal actions and government audits and investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

overview 

  

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies based on our 2003 revenues of 122 billion we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internetbased plans for employer groups governmentsponsored programs and individuals as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 68 million members in our medical insurance programs as well as approximately 17 million members in our specialty products programs in 2003 approximately 70 of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in florida illinois texas kentucky and ohio during 2003 we derived approximately 42 of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government including two federal government contracts with the department of defense to provide health insurance coverage to tricare beneficiaries and our contracts with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms to provide health insurance coverage for our medicarechoice members 

  

we manage our business with two segments commercial and government the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines of business fully insured medical administrative services only or aso and specialty the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicarechoice medicaid and tricare our government segment has produced consistent profits and relatively stable margins for many years our business strategy largely revolves around increasing our commercial segment profitability while building on our existing strength in the government segment 

  

our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumerchoice product designs which are supported by service excellence and industryleading electronic capabilities including education tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet to that end we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as “smart” products we believe that these smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of fast rising health care costs for their employees although enrollment in our smart products is a relatively modest 130000 members at december 31 2003 we believe that substantial growth in these products which may be competitively priced to produce higher margins is the key for our continuing improvement in the commercial segment january 2004 sales were approximately 70000 in our smart products 

  

other important elements which impact our commercial segment profitability are the competitive pricing environment and market conditions with respect to pricing there is the balancing act between sustaining or 

  

increasing underwriting margins versus achieving enrollment growth with respect to market conditions there is the impact of economies of scale on administrative overhead as a result of the decline in popularity of tightly managed hmos and intensive utilization review procedures medical costs become increasingly comparable among the larger competitors with product design and consumer involvement then becoming the more important drivers of medical services consumption as a result administrative expense efficiency is becoming a primary driver of commercial margin sustainability in line with that philosophy we continue to reduce our administrative expense structure realize administrative expense savings through technology tools and look at acquisition opportunities that align with our geographic presence and commercial strategy 

  

in december 2003 we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement with the ochsner clinic foundation of new orleans louisiana to acquire ochsner health plan we believe that this acquisition will enhance our presence in the southern united states an area growing in population and commercial activity in addition to creating a new humana market in new orleans the ochsner health plan acquisition is expected to facilitate sales opportunities in our existing houston market and is anticipated to make us more attractive to national accounts 

  

in our government segment there were two significant developments in 2003 first in august 2003 our subsidiary humana military healthcare services or hmhs was awarded the department of defense’s tricare contract to support healthcare delivery to active duty and retired service members and their families in the south region beginning in 2004 the south region is one of the three regions in the united states as defined by the department of defense’s new contract alignment under the terms of the award hmhs will be the managed care support contractor serving approximately 28 million tricare beneficiaries in tennessee south carolina georgia alabama mississippi florida arkansas louisiana oklahoma and texas most importantly procurement of the south region contract positions us to continue our tricare operating margins consistent with the levels we have enjoyed since beginning the tricare program in july 1996 

  

second in december 2003 president bush signed medicare modernization legislation that provides stabilization funding for the medicarechoice program and may provide longerterm opportunities for humana including the potential to 1 expand the company’s current medicarechoice market presence 2 become a medicareadvantage regional ppo 3 add an interim drug discount card and 4 become a prescription drug standalone plan we are evaluating these potential opportunities and anticipate completing our analysis during 2004 we believe the new medicare legislation demonstrates the federal government’s financial commitment to the private payor program and the commitment to providing health benefits and options to seniors which should translate to stable if not increasing participation from humana in this sector 

  

during 2003 our revenue increased by almost 1 billion to 122 billion versus 113 billion the previous year 80 of the revenue increase was derived from our commercial segment primarily a result of underwriting our premiums commensurate with underlying medical cost inflation the leveraging of this increase in underwriting dollars in excess of administrative and overhead expenses was the primary driver of the increase in our commercial and consolidated pretax profits during the second quarter of 2003 we completed a transition from seven service centers to four which has resulted in continuing administrative efficiencies 

  

cash flows from operations generated 4131 million during 2003 441 million of which was used to purchase 37 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 1203 per share we invested 1013 million on capital expenditures during 2003 

  

we intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements 

  

pending acquisition 

  

in december 2003 we reached a definitive agreement to purchase ochsner health plan from ochsner clinic foundation having approximately 152000 commercial medical members primarily in fully insured large group accounts and approximately 36000 members in the medicarechoice program this transaction which is subject to state regulatory approval is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

medical expense recognition 

  

medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported or ibnr ibnr represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows 

  

   

estimating ibnr is complex involves a significant amount of judgment and represents a material portion of our medical and other expenses payable accordingly it represents a critical accounting estimate changes in this estimate can materially affect either favorably or unfavorably our results from operations and overall financial position for example a 100 basis point or 1 percent change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at december 31 2003 which represents approximately 40 of total liabilities would require an adjustment of approximately 13 million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known 

  

we develop our estimate for ibnr using actuarial methodologies and assumptions primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns as well as historical medical cost trends depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated we apply a different method in determining our estimate for periods prior to the most recent three months the key assumption used in estimating our ibnr is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels or known changes in claim payment processes the completion factor is a calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period for the most recent three months the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data provider contracting changes changes in benefit levels product mix and weekday seasonality 

  

the completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result conversely for the most recent three months of incurred claims the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation 

  

medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy the drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components other external factors such as governmentmandated benefits or other regulatory changes catastrophes and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends additionally as we realign our commercial strategy we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services monitoring of inpatient admissions and requirements for physician referrals other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends all of these factors are considered in estimating ibnr and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months each of these factors requires significant judgment by management 

  

the completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december 31 2003 data 

  

     

most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider as a result these liabilities generally are described as having a “shorttail” which causes less than 2 of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than 12 months as such we expect that substantially all of the 2003 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2004 

  

our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are 

  

expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate therefore in many situations the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 

  

ibnr established in connection with our tricare contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than with our other operations as a result of having more variables which impact the estimate such variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions many of these variables are impacted significantly by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the united states armed forces 

  

our tricare contracts contain risksharing provisions with the department of defense and with subcontractors which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the medical claim amounts included in our annual bids additionally other factors impacting medical claims expenses such as changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries and changes in the level of usage of military treatment facilities result in equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment process as a result of the above contract provisions the impact of changes in estimates for prior year tricare medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially whether positive or negative 

  

the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

   

amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated favorable development positive amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated unfavorable development 

  

as summarized in the previous table claim reserve balances at december 31 2000 ultimately settled during 2001 for 234 million less than the amounts originally estimated representing 03 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2000 during 2002 claim reserve balances at december 31 2001 ultimately settled for 123 million more than the amounts originally estimated representing 01 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2001 this 357 million increase in the amounts incurred related to prior years was substantially all attributable to our tricare operations and resulted primarily from enhanced benefits enacted for tricare beneficiaries as a result of congressional legislation the impact of which was not fully determinable at december 31 2001 as these additional medical expenses were recognized during 2002 we also recognized and received commensurate revenues from the department of defense as a result of change orders and bid price adjustments or bpas 

  

during 2003 claim reserve balances at december 31 2002 ultimately settled for 761 million less than the amounts originally recorded representing 08 of medical claim expenses recorded in 2002 this 884 million decline in the amounts incurred related to prior years consists of 683 million attributable to our tricare operations with the remaining 201 million primarily resulting from fourth quarter 2002 utilization in our commercial medical products ultimately being lower than originally estimated the 683 million increase in tricare incurred related to prior years resulted from establishing the reserves resulting from the enhanced benefits for tricare beneficiaries as discussed above as well as lower than originally estimated utilization of medical services by tricare beneficiaries in the second half of 2002 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we generally establish oneyear contracts with commercial employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group’s 30day written notice our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our medicarechoice contracts with the federal government which renew annually our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage except for tricare contracts discussed in the following section our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items such as age working status or specific health issues of the member 

  

premium revenues and aso fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates in addition we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group an individual or the government also known as retroactive membership adjustments are based on historical trends we monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue 

  

we bill and collect premium and aso fee remittances from employer groups the federal and state governments and individual medicarechoice members monthly premium and aso fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 

  

tricare revenues 

  

base premium revenues as originally specified in our tricare contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services tricare revenues also include amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of bpas and change orders 

  

under our tricare contracts we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks samestore utilization of services and administrative overhead however the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities or mtfs changes in the number of persons eligible for tricare benefits and medical unit cost inflation bpas are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk we work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and mtf workload data and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual bpa requirements we record revenues applicable to bpas when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured because final settlement of bpas occurs only at specified intervals typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions cumulative amounts receivable or payable under bpas may be outstanding in excess of a year amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses respectively in our consolidated balance sheets amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other longterm assets or other longterm liabilities respectively the increase in activity and deployments surrounding military conflicts in the middle east has significantly impacted bpa activity in recent years 

  

tricare change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price which results in additional premium revenues examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for tricare beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as tricare for life and tricare senior pharmacy like bpas we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured unlike bpas where settlement only occurs at specified intervals change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year 

  

total tricare premium and aso fee receivables were as follows at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

   

our tricare contracts also contain risksharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts amounts receivable from the federal government under such risksharing provisions are included in the bpa receivable above while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately 173 million at december 31 2003 are included in medical and other expenses payable in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

investment securities 

  

investment securities totaled 19958 million or 38 of total assets at december 31 2003 debt securities totaled 19606 million or 98 of our total investment portfolio more than 94 of our debt securities were of investmentgrade quality with an average credit rating of aa by standard  poor’s at december 31 2003 most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end b or better of the noninvestment grade spectrum our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

  

duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value to changes in interest rates providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates however actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 35 years at december 31 2003 based on this duration a 1 increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately 70 million 

  

our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices nontraded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately 

  

held or where an observable quoted market price does not exist are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows unrealized holding gains and losses net of applicable deferred taxes are included as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized from a sale or impairment 

  

gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december 31 2003 included the following 

  

   

we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment we consider factors affecting the investee factors affecting the industry the investee operates within and general debt and equity market trends we consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment 

  

unrealized losses at december 31 2003 resulted from 96 positions less than 3 of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year the unrealized losses at december 31 2003 generally can be attributed to changes in interest rates all securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities after taking into account these and other factors including our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary 

  

we recorded impairment losses of 32 million in 2003 272 million in 2002 and 24 million in 2001 after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary 

  

goodwill and longlived asset 

  

at december 31 2003 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 23 of total assets and 65 of total stockholders’ equity 

  

in accordance with the adoption of an accounting standard on january 1 2002 as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments the commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of fully and selfinsured medical and specialty the government segment’s three reporting units consist of medicarechoice tricare and medicaid goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition if goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of january 1 2002 based upon the reporting units’ relative fair value this process resulted in the allocation of 6332 million of goodwill to the commercial segment and 1437 million of goodwill to the government segment 

  

our strategy longrange business plan and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios we used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weightedaverage cost of capital key assumptions including changes in membership premium yields medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected 

  

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation for these assets we recognized losses due to impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of 308 million in 2003 24 million in 2002 and none in 2001 see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements

on december 17 2003 the staff of the securities and exchange commission “sec” or the “staff” issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition  or sab 104 which supercedes staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab 101  sab 104’s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” additionally sab 104 rescinds the sec’s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers  or the faq issued with sab 101 that had been codified in sec topic 13 revenue recognition  selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab 104 while the wording of sab 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf 0021 the revenue recognition principles of sab 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab 104 the provisions of sab 104 do not have an impact on our current revenue recognition policies 

  

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51  or fin 46 the primary objectives of fin 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary in december 2003 the fasb issued fin 46r consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb 51 revised december 2003  which replaces fin 46 fin 46r incorporates certain modifications to fin 46 adopted by the fasb subsequent to the issuance of fin 46 including modifications to the scope of fin 46 additionally fin 46r incorporates much of the guidance previously issued in the form of fasb staff positions 

  

for all special purpose entities “spes” created prior to february 1 2003 public entities must apply either the provisions of fin 46 or early adopt the provisions of fin 46r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december 15 2003 if a public entity applies fin 46 for such period the provisions of fin 46r must be applied as of the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march 15 2004 for all nonspes created prior to february 1 2003 public entities will be required to adopt fin 46r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march 15 2004 for all entities regardless of whether the entity is an spe that were created subsequent to january 31 2003 public entities were already required to apply the provisions of fin 46 and should continue doing so unless they elect to early adopt the provisions of fin 46r as of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december 15 2003 if they do not elect to early adopt fin 46r public entities would be required to apply fin 46r to those postjanuary 31 2003 entities as of the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march 15 2004 

  

as part of our ongoing business we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or spes which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as of december 31 2003 we are not involved in any spe transactions the adoption of fin 46 or fin 46r is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2003 and 2002 

  

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

   

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

   

overview 

  

net income was 2289 million or 141 per diluted share in 2003 compared to net income of 1428 million or 085 per diluted share in 2002 the increase in earnings resulted primarily from significant improvement in operating earnings for the commercial segment and a decrease in expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items 

  

premium revenues and medical membership 

  

premium revenues increased 82 to 118 billion for 2003 compared to 109 billion for 2002 higher premium revenues resulted primarily from increases in fully insured commercial per member premiums and an increase in tricare premiums items impacting per member premiums include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates as well as changes in geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

  

commercial segment premium revenues increased 124 to 66 billion for 2003 compared to 58 billion for 2002 this improvement resulted primarily from increases in per member premiums in the 12 to 14 range for 2003 on our fully insured commercial business additionally our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 05 or 12500 members to 2352800 at december 31 2003 compared to 2340300 at december 31 2002 

  

we anticipate 2004 commercial fully insured per member premiums will increase approximately 8 to 10 this reduction in the rate of increase in commercial fully insured per member premiums is expected to occur as a result of a changing mix of business reductions in the level of benefits purchased by our customers and a more competitive pricing environment the change in the mix of business which is expected to result from growth in our individual products and changes in the products purchased by our large group customers and reductions in the level of benefit purchased will result in a commensurate reduction in medical cost trends we expect commercial fully insured and aso medical membership to achieve a combined increase for all of 2004 of between 6 and 9 with most of the growth occurring in the aso business 

  

government segment premium revenues increased 33 to 53 billion for 2003 compared to 51 billion for 2002 this increase primarily was attributable to our tricare business partially offset by a reduction in our medicarechoice membership rates were increased upon annual renewal of our base tricare contract and led to an increase in tricare premium revenues of 2483 million or 124 compared to 2002 medicarechoice membership was 328600 at december 31 2003 compared to 344100 at december 31 2002 a decline of 15500 members or 45 this decline resulted as we exited several counties in some of our markets effective january 1 2003 and general attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs per member premiums increased in the 4 to 6 range for 2003 due to dima we are expecting a return to growth with medicareadvantage membership increasing to approximately 340000 to 360000 members by the end of 2004 and increases in per member premiums in the range of 8 to 10 

  

administrative services fees 

  

administrative services fees for 2003 were 2717 million an increase of 273 million from 2444 million for 2002 for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 196 million or 190 to 1228 million this increase corresponds to the higher level of aso membership at december 31 2003 which was 712400 members compared to 652200 members at december 31 2002 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member administrative services fees for the government segment increased 76 million when comparing 2003 to 2002 this increase resulted from contractual adjustments related to tricare for life a program for seniors in which we provide medical benefit administrative services 

  

investment and other income 

  

investment and other income totaled 1294 million in 2003 an increase of 430 million from 864 million in 2002 this increase resulted primarily from an increase in net realized capital gains due to a 152 million gain from the sale of a venture capital investment and lower investment impairment losses a result of an improving market we recorded investment impairment losses of 32 million in 2003 compared to 272 million in 2002 higher average invested balances offset lower interest rates the average yield on investment securities was 35 in 2003 declining from 46 in 2002 

  

medical expense 

  

total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues or medical expense ratio mer for 2003 were 835 decreasing 10 basis points from 836 for 2002 

  

the commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2003 was 829 decreasing 60 basis points from 835 for 2002 the improvement in the mer primarily resulted from per member premium rate increases in excess of medical cost trends for our large group customers and the attrition of groups with higher medical expense ratios we expect the commercial segment mer to increase between 100 to 130 basis points in 2004 primarily due to competitive pricing pressures and the pass through of increased administrative expense efficiencies to customers in the form of lower rates 

  

the government segment medical expense ratio for 2003 was 843 increasing 50 basis points from 838 for 2002 this increase primarily was attributable to tricare as a result of having a higher level of bpa activity in the prior year 

  

sga expense 

  

total selling general and administrative or sga expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees or sga expense ratio decreased 50 basis points in 2003 primarily because of a decrease in severance and related employee benefit costs of 290 million the absence of 2002 expenses of 301 million associated with a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items offset by an increase in building impairments of 148 million 

  

increased operating efficiency led to the consolidation of seven service centers into four and an enterprisewide workforce reduction affecting administrative expenses in both 2003 and 2002 by recording expenses for severance and related employee benefit costs and building impairments severance and related employee benefit costs more fully described in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements amounted to 112 million in 2003 and 402 million in 2002 the 2002 severance amount primarily related to the service center consolidation building impairments more fully described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements amounted to 172 million in 2003 and 24 million in 2002 

  

during 2002 we recorded 301 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of physician corporation of america or pca the 301 million of expenses in 2002 resulted from three issues first on january 28 2003 we settled a dispute with a provider for 83 million primarily regarding old claims of pca subsidiaries dating prior to humana’s 1997 acquisition second during the fourth quarter of 2002 as a december 2 2002 trial date approached efforts intensified to reach settlement of an old pca shareholder dispute for periods prior to humana’s 1997 acquisition of pca as a result we accrued 157 million because the loss was probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated we reversed 18 million of this reserve when the final settlement was paid during the third quarter of 2003 third in connection with an agreement reached in november 2002 we partially wroteoff a note receivable of 61 million from the purchaser of our workers’ compensation business which was sold in 2000 the agreement with the purchaser resulted when a significant customer contract was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2002 we acquired the workers’ compensation business in connection with the 1997 pca acquisition 

  

  

the commercial and government segments’ sga expense ratios likewise were impacted by the same items described previously operational efficiencies gained from completing the consolidation of the service centers and workforce reductions as well as increases in premiums in excess of inflationary trends on administrative expenses are expected to decrease the commercial segment’s sga expense ratio to a range of 155 to 165 and the government segment’s sga expense ratio to a range of 110 to 120 in 2004 

  

depreciation and amortization was 1268 million in 2003 an increase of 61 million or 50 from 1207 million in 2002 the increase results from accelerated depreciation of software in 2003 of 135 million as more fully described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements partially offset by lower amortization related to other intangible assets as costs associated with the government contract acquired with the tricare 2 and 5 transaction became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 174 million in 2003 an increase of 01 million from 173 million in 2002 this increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of 300 million senior notes in august 2003 offset by lower interest rates 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate in 2003 of 336 increased 16 compared to the 32 effective tax rate in 2002 the increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a lower proportion of taxexempt investment income to pretax income during 2002 the internal revenue service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately 326 million this was offset by an increase of approximately 245 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2002 and 2001 

  

certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

   

medical membership was as follows at december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

   

overview 

  

net income was 1428 million or 085 per diluted share in 2002 compared to net income of 1172 million or 070 per diluted share in 2001 the increase in earnings primarily resulted from premium revenues increasing more than operating costs in both our commercial and government segments and the nonamortization of goodwill partially offset by expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items 

  

premium revenues and medical membership 

  

premium revenues increased 100 to 109 billion for 2002 compared to 99 billion for 2001 higher premium revenues resulted primarily from significant increases in fully insured commercial per member premiums and an increase in tricare premiums items impacting per member premiums include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates as well as changes in geographic mix of membership the mix of product offerings and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

  

commercial segment premium revenues increased 112 to 58 billion for 2002 compared to 52 billion for 2001 this increase primarily resulted from increases in fully insured commercial per member premiums in the 12 to 14 range for 2002 additionally our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 17 or 39000 members to 2340300 at december 31 2002 compared to 2301300 at december 31 2001 

  

government segment premium revenues increased 85 to 51 billion for 2002 compared to 47 billion for 2001 this increase was primarily attributable to our tricare business partially offset by a reduction in our medicarechoice membership 

  

tricare premium revenues were 20 billion an increase of 660 million or 492 compared to 2001 334 million of the increase in tricare premium revenues is attributable to the acquisition of tricare regions 2 and 5 on may 31 2001 with the remainder of the increase attributable to the annual increase in our contractually determined base revenues and increases in premium revenues recorded as a result of bid price adjustments or bpas and change orders 

  

increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with bpas resulted from an increase in the number of eligible tricare beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities or mtfs by tricare beneficiaries the number of tricare beneficiaries increased in 2002 as a result of the events of september 11 2001 the subsequent buildup of military personnel to support military operations in afghanistan and the continuing buildup of military personnel surrounding other international tensions a decline in the usage of mtfs occurred for some periods after september 11 2001 when certain mtfs were restricted by the department of defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for tricare beneficiaries as mandated by congress which includes among other items a reduction of the beneficiary outofpocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments 

  

collectively all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during 2002 since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and bpa process we recognized revenues related to these adjustments when the settlement amount became determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured 

  

medicarechoice premium revenues were 26 billion in 2002 a decrease of 96 from 29 billion in 2001 medicarechoice membership was 344100 at december 31 2002 compared to 393900 at december 31 2001 a decline of 49800 members or 126 medicarechoice per member premiums increased 56 in 2002 the decrease in membership was due to our exit of various counties on january 1 2002 as well as attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs 

  

administrative services fees 

  

administrative services fees for 2002 were 2444 million an increase of 1073 million from 1371 million for 2001 for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 190 million or 226 to 1032 million this increase corresponds to the higher level of aso membership at december 31 2002 which was 652200 members compared to 592500 members at december 31 2001 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member administrative services fees for the government segment increased 883 million when comparing 2002 to 2001 the tricare regions 2 and 5 acquisition accounted for 51 million of this increase with the remainder attributable to the implementation of the tricare for life benefits program effective october 1 2001 tricare for life is a program for seniors where we provide medical benefit administrative services 

  

investment and other income 

  

investment and other income totaled 864 million in 2002 a decrease of 324 million from 1188 million in 2001 net realized losses of 101 million in 2002 compared to net realized gains of 139 million in 2001 net realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of 272 million primarily related to privately held venture capital investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary lower interest rates also decreased investment income 109 million in 2002 compared to 2001 the average yield on investment securities was 46 in 2002 declining from 51 in 2001 

  

medical expense 

  

the medical expense ratio for 2002 was 836 increasing 30 basis points from 833 in 2001 

  

the commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 835 increasing 40 basis points from 831 in 2001 this increase primarily was due to the shift in the mix of our fully insured commercial medical membership to a heavier concentration of larger group sizes large group commercial membership represented approximately 65 of our fully insured commercial membership at december 31 2002 compared to 62 at december 31 2001 large group membership traditionally experiences a higher medical expense ratio and a lower selling general and administrative expense ratio than does our small group membership 

  

the government segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 838 increasing 20 basis points from 836 in 2001 this increase primarily was attributable to tricare as discussed previously tricare medical expense increased due to expanded benefits for tricare beneficiaries mandated by congress an increase in eligible beneficiaries and an increase in the use of humana’s provider network rather than mtfs since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts or were for items that the department of defense retains financial risk we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bpa processes these higher medical expenses combined with the associated higher premium revenues resulted in an overall increase in the government medical expense ratio 

  

sga expense 

  

the sga expense ratio for 2002 was 159 increasing 60 basis points from 153 for 2001 this increase primarily resulted from an increase in severance and related employee benefit expenses of 360 million longlived asset impairments of 24 million and the establishment of reserves for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of physician corporation of america or pca of 301 million 

  

the commercial segment’s sga expense ratio was 180 for 2002 increasing 40 basis points from 2001 of 176 this increase was the result of the items discussed above 

  

the government segment’s sga expense ratio was 135 for 2002 increasing 70 basis points compared to 128 in 2001 this increase resulted from the items discussed above and a change in the mix of revenues a higher proportion of revenues was generated from administrative services fees primarily from the tricare regions 2 and 5 acquisition and the implementation of the tricare for life benefit programs effective october 1 2001 aso business carries a much higher sga ratio than fully insured business 

  

depreciation and amortization was 1207 million in 2002 a decrease of 408 million or 253 from 1615 million in 2001 as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements we ceased amortizing goodwill on january 1 2002 in accordance with adopting a new accounting standard this decreased goodwill amortization by 55 million on a comparable basis depreciation and amortization was 1065 million in 2001 excluding goodwill amortization expense the 142 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001 as adjusted resulted from capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and a full year of amortization of other intangible assets related to the acquisition of tricare regions 2 and 5 on may 31 2001 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 173 million in 2002 a decrease of 80 million from 253 million in 2001 this decrease primarily resulted from lower interest rates 

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate in 2002 of 32 decreased 4 compared to the 36 effective tax rate in 2001 the lower effective tax rate in 2002 primarily resulted from the cessation of nondeductible goodwill amortization on january 1 2002 partially offset by higher state income taxes and a lower proportion of taxexempt investment income to pretax income in addition during 2002 the internal revenue service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately 326 million this was offset by an increase of approximately 245 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate 

  

liquidity 

  

our consolidated liquidity continued to strengthen in 2003 with cash and cash equivalents increasing to 9314 million at december 31 2003 from 7214 million at december 31 2002 because we operate as a holding company our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions our parent company liquidity also improved during 2003 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments at our parent company amounted to 3994 million at december 31 2003 increasing 2124 million from 1870 million at december 31 2002 the primary source for the increase in cash and cash equivalents has been the increase in our net income 

  

the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 is summarized as follows 

  

   

  

the primary drivers of operating cash flow in our business are premium collections and medical claim payments because premiums generally are collected in advance of claims payments by a period up to several months in many instances our business should normally produce strong cash flows during a period of increasing enrollment conversely cash flows would be negatively impacted during a period of shrinking enrollment as was the case for us during 2001 the exception to this general rule is the collection of tricare bpas and change orders which may occur up to six months after the end of a contract year other activities that impact our cash flows are the collection of aso fees and investment income and the payment of operating expenses interest expense and taxes 

  

during 2003 our operating cash flows were not substantially impacted by a change in the timing of premium and aso fee collections or medical claim payments as both amounts generally increased with inflation and membership growth however during 2002 our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by slower cash collections of premium and aso fee receivables when tricare receivables increased by 174 million as detailed in the following table 

  

   

tricare base receivables which are collected monthly in the ordinary course of business increased in 2003 as rates under our base tricare contract increased upon the annual renewal of the contracts for regions 3 and 4 and regions 2 and 5 total tricare receivables significantly increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to change orders and bpas due to an increase in activity and deployments surrounding military conflicts in the middle east 

  

the timing of payments for claims can significantly impact comparisons of our operating cash flows between years during 2001 operating cash flows were reduced by 1320 million as a result of our paying down unprocessed claim inventories since then the level of claims inventory has stabilized the following table presents the estimated valuation and number of unprocessed claims on hand performance metrics we regularly review claims on hand represent the estimated number of provider requests for reimbursement that have been received but not yet processed 

  

   

medical and other expenses payable increased during 2003 and 2002 due primarily to medical claims inflation and increases in membership the timing of claim payments did not significantly impact 2003 or 2002 cash flows from operations the detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

       

the timing of medicarechoice premium receipts may significantly impact our cash flows from operations in a particular period as the medicarechoice premium receipt is payable to us on the first day of each month when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday we receive this payment at the end of the previous month since this amount is significant the timing of its receipt can cause a material fluctuation in our operating cash flows from period to period the medicarechoice premium receipts for january 2004 of 2119 million and for january 2003 of 2058 million were received early in december 2003 and december 2002 respectively because january 1 is a holiday this timing accounts for a significant portion of the unearned revenues balance on our consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

cash flow from investing activities 

  

during 2003 we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities primarily shortduration fixed income securities totaling 2831 million during 2003 2002 and 2001 we also made capital expenditures as discussed below 

  

cash flow from financing activities 

  

during 2003 we converted our shortterm commercial paper debt to longterm borrowings and repurchased common shares as discussed below the cash used in financing activities in 2002 resulted primarily from common share repurchases while the use of cash in 2001 resulted from reductions in borrowings 

  

capital expenditures 

  

our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 1013 million in 2003 1121 million 

  

in 2002 and 1155 million in 2001 excluding acquisitions we expect our total capital expenditures in 2004 to be approximately 100 million most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities 

  

stock repurchase plan 

  

for the year ended december 31 2003 we acquired 37 million of our common shares at an aggregate cost of 441 million or an average of 1203 per share of these shares 14 million were acquired in connection with employee stock plans at an aggregate cost of 233 million or an average of 1627 per share and the remaining 23 million shares were acquired in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of 208 million or an average of 931 per share in july 2003 the board of directors authorized an additional use of up to 100 million for the repurchase of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans the shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as of february 24 2004 942 million of the july 2003 authorization remains available for share repurchases 

  

debt 

  

shortterm and longterm debt outstanding was as follows at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

   

senior notes 

  

in order to termout our shortterm debt and take advantage of historically low interest rates we issued 300 million 630 senior notes due august 1 2018 on august 5 2003 our net proceeds reduced for the cost of the offering were approximately 2958 million the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including the funding of our short term cash needs 

  

in order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our 300 million 630 senior notes and our 300 million 725 senior notes attributable to fluctuations in interest rates we entered into interest rate swap agreements interest rate swap agreements which are considered derivatives are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount or notional amount for a specified period the interest rate swap agreements have the same critical terms as our 630 senior notes and our 725 senior notes changes in the fair value of the 630 or 725 senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are estimated based 

  

on quoted market prices of comparable agreements and reflect the amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 

  

our interest rate swap agreements exchange the fixed interest rate under our 630 and 725 senior notes for a variable interest rate at december 31 2003 the variable interest rate was 203 for the 630 senior notes and 626 for the 725 senior notes the 300 million swap agreements for the 630 senior notes mature on august 1 2018 and the 300 million swap agreements for the 725 senior notes mature on august 1 2006 and each has the same critical terms as the related senior notes 

  

in june 2003 we recorded a deferred gain and received proceeds of 316 million in exchange for new swap agreements discussed above related to our 725 senior notes the corresponding deferred swap gain of 316 million is being amortized to reduce interest expense over the remaining term of the 725 senior notes the carrying value of our 725 senior notes has been increased 262 million by the remaining deferred swap gain balance at december 31 2003 

  

at december 31 2003 the 128 million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other longterm assets likewise the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased 128 million to reflect its fair value the counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships 

  

credit agreements 

  

we maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a 265 million 4year revolving credit agreement and a 265 million 364day revolving credit agreement with a oneyear termout option a oneyear termout option converts the outstanding borrowings if any under the credit agreement to a oneyear term loan upon expiration the 4year revolving credit agreement expires in october 2005 in october 2003 we renewed the 364day revolving credit agreement which expires in october 2004 unless extended 

  

there were no balances outstanding under either agreement at december 31 2003 or 2002 under these agreements at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion of both agreements bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the spread which varies depending on our credit ratings ranges from 80 to 125 basis points for our 4year agreement and 85 to 1375 basis points for our 364day agreement we also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 25 basis points may fluctuate between 15 and 50 basis points depending upon our credit ratings the competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis at our option 

  

these credit agreements and the agreement relating to the conduit commercial paper program described below contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios at december 31 2003 we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements the terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to humana in the future 

  

commercial paper programs 

  

we maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program under this program a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial 

  

paper the 265 million 364day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to 265 million 

  

we also maintain and may issue shortterm debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow the program is backed by our credit agreements described above under the terms of our credit agreements aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed 530 million 

  

at december 31 2003 we had no direct or indirect conduit commercial paper borrowings outstanding 

  

other borrowings 

  

other borrowings of 49 million at december 31 2003 and 55 million at december 31 2002 represent financing for the renovation of a building bear interest at 2 per annum are collateralized by the building and are payable in various installments through 2014 

  

shelf registration 

  

on april 1 2003 our universal shelf registration became effective with the securities and exchange commission this allows us to register debt or equity securities from time to time with the amount price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale after the issuance of our 300 million 630 senior notes in august 2003 we have up to 300 million remaining from a total of 600 million under the universal shelf registration the universal shelf registration allows us to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes including repayment or refinancing of borrowings working capital capital expenditures investments acquisitions or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 

  

contractual obligations 

  

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2003 as follows 

  

      

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

our 5year and 7year airplane operating leases provide for a residual value payment of no more than 92 million at the end of the lease terms which expire december 29 2004 for the 5year lease and january 1 2010 for the 7year lease we have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased airplanes or the airplanes can be sold to a third party if we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of 44 million related to the 5year lease and 48 million related to the 7year lease the amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party after considering the current fair value of the airplanes we recorded a 15 million provision during 2003 for the exposure from the residual value guarantee during 2003 we terminated two 5year airplane leases early the impact of these transactions was not material 

  

indemnifications and guarantees 

  

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our tricare subsidiaries 

  

in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract which may include for example litigation or claims relating to past performance such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses historically payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial 

  

other liquidity factors 

  

our investmentgrade credit rating at december 31 2003 was baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s and bbb according to standard  poor’s corporation or sp a downgrade to ba2 or lower by moody’s and bb or lower by sp would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a 300 million notional amount the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap agreement if cancelled we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on december 31 2003 we would have received 87 million other than the swap agreements adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create increase or accelerate any liabilities adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future 

  

related parties 

  

no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held april 22 2004—see “certain transactions with management and others” 

  

regulatory requirements 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

  

as of december 31 2003 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 10865 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 6404 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level certain states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels if rbc were adopted by all states at december 31 2003 each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have 3819 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under rbc 

  

one tricare subsidiary under the regions 3 and 4 contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities we were in compliance with this requirement at december 31 2003 

  

future liquidity needs 

  

because of the items discussed in this liquidity section we believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet short and intermediateterm liquidity needs we also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities as well as to fund capital requirements 

  

market risksensitive financial instruments and positions 

  

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the shortterm duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 

  

we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including among others unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio shifts in the asset mix between tax and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years changes in 3 month libor rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven times libor was 115 at december 31 2003 our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in libor could not exceed 115 basis points 

  

   

government contracts 

  

our medicareadvantage contracts with the federal government are renewed for a oneyear term each december 31 unless notice of termination is received at least 90 days prior thereto in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act or dima was signed into law dima includes provisions that require the 2004 stabilization funding to be directed toward increased reimbursement for providers increased benefits or access for members or decreased member premiums we believe dima will open new opportunities for us however we do not believe that the benefit to our 2004 financial position results of operations or cash flows will be material 

  

our current tricare contract with the department of defense will be in effect until april 30 2004 for regions 2 and 5 and until june 30 2004 for regions 3 and 4 each of the contracts is subject to a oneyear renewal at the government’s option we believe these contracts will continue until the tricare transition described below 

  

on august 21 2003 the department of defense notified us that we were awarded the contract for the south region one of three newlycreated regions under the government’s revised tricare program the current tricare regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new south region along with region 6 which is currently administered by another contractor the current regions 2 and 5 will become part of the north region which was awarded to another contractor 

  

pursuant to the department of defense’s bid process each of the three awards was subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders of prime contracts however none of the protests were successful 

  

under the department of defense’s current schedule for implementation of the new tricare contracts regions 2 and 5 will transition to the new north region for the start of healthcare delivery on july 1 2004 regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on august 1 2004 and region 6 will become part of our new south region for the start of healthcare delivery on november 1 2004 if this schedule is realized our tricare membership is expected to temporarily decline to 15 million in july 2004 and is expected to increase to 28 million in november 2004 this will also result in a decline in revenues during this period 

  

in addition retail pharmacy benefits for tricare beneficiaries will be administered separately under the new department of defense tricare retail pharmacy program on september 26 2003 we were notified that we were not awarded the retail pharmacy contract and later that our protest of this award decision was not upheld 

  

we currently have medicaid contracts with the puerto rico health insurance administration through june 30 2005 subject to each party agreeing upon annual rates in july 2003 we signed amendments to the puerto rico medicaid contracts regarding a premium rate increase for the annual period ending june 30 2004 our other medicaid contracts are in florida and illinois and are annual contracts as of december 31 2003 puerto rico accounted for approximately 84 of our total medicaid membership 

  

other than as described herein the loss of any of our existing or pending government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

legal proceedings 

  

we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business including employment matters breach of contract actions tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” of item 3 in 

  

part 1 we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters in addition recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

cautionary statements 

  

this document includes both historical and forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements are made within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 we intend such forwardlooking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events trends and uncertainties these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things the information discussed below in making these statements we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results our business is highly complicated regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 

  

if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate our profitability could decline 

  

we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record medical claims reserves for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however increases in the use or cost of services by our members competition government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 

  

these factors may include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively our membership and profitability could decline 

  

we are in a highly competitive industry many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future including emerging competitors in the medicareadvantage program in ecommerce insurance or benefit programs and in consumerdirected health plans contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 

  

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationship with our providers in various markets among other issues could affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of or entrance to medicareadvantage or commercial markets if we do not compete effectively in our markets if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share if membership does not increase as we expect or if it declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future this strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business introduction of new products and benefit designs including our smart products the successful implementation of our ebusiness initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies we believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership this alignment is achieved through reductions in workforce or by employing additional people in certain strategic operating areas such as sales and underwriting additionally we have consolidated our service centers and their related systems as part of our operational initiatives there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement new information systems or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs our ability to adequately price our products and services provide effective and efficient service to our customers and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems as a result of our past and ongoing acquisition activities we have acquired additional systems we have been taking steps to 

  

reduce the number of systems we operate have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity we could have operational disruptions have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes have regulatory problems have increases in operating expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or suffer other adverse consequences our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 

  

we depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systemsrelated support equipment facilities and certain data including data center operations data network voice communication services and pharmacy data processing this dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors due to continued consolidation in the industry there are a limited number of service organizations with the size scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing and management however we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms a change in service providers however could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results 

  

we rely on our agreements with customers confidentiality agreements with employees and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry we expect software products to be increasingly subject to thirdparty infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows 

  

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our operations integrating new systems protecting our proprietary information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully our financial results could suffer 

  

in general prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years these increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brandname drugs and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes in order to control prescription drug costs we have implemented multitiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs including our fourtiered copayment benefit design rx4 and an rx allowance program we are also evaluating other multitiered designs we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

  

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions and tort claims 

  

we together with some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits these include an action against us and nine of our competitors that purports to 

  

be brought on behalf of health care providers this suit alleges breaches of federal statutes including erisa and rico 

  

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act rico and other statutes may be sought while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded additionally the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly as a result we have increased the amount of risk that we selfinsure particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our selfinsurance however some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

  

a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” of item 3 in part i we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters in addition recent court decisions including some that erode protections under the employee retirement income security act or erisa and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

  

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal state and local government health care coverage programs including the tricare medicarechoice and medicaid programs these programs involve various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 

  

the health care industry in general and health insurance particularly health maintenance organizations or hmos and preferred provider organizations or ppos are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

state regulations require our licensed operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities additionally those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments loans loan repayments or other payments to us 

  

in recent years significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

all of these proposals could apply to us 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 

  

the national association of insurance commissioners or naic has adopted riskbased capital requirements also known as rbc which is subject to statebystate adoption and to the extent implemented sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and hmo companies the naic recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for hmos has been adopted in most states in which we operate the hmo rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries 

  

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules we have made significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions the compliance and enforcement date for standard transactions and code sets rules was october 16 2003 we have continued to be in compliance with this regulation however as many providers indicated that they could not yet comply cms stated that covered entities making a good faith effort to comply with hipaa transactions and codeset standards would be allowed to implement contingency plans to maintain their operations and cash flows on october 15 2003 we announced implementation of a contingency plan to accept noncompliant electronic transactions from our providers we will continue to accept and process transactions sent in prehipaa electronic formats from providers who are showing a goodfaith effort until all providers and clearinghouses are capable of transmitting fully compliant standards transactions as defined in the hipaa implementation guidelines or until cms begins enforcement of the hipaa electronic data interchange regulations management believes that the implementation of our contingency plans has minimized any disruptions in our business operations during this transition however if entities with which we do business do not ultimately comply with the hipaa transactions and code set standards it could result in disruptions of certain of our business operations 

  

additionally under the new hipaa privacy rules which became effective on april 14 2003 we must now comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed regulations issued in february 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april 21 2005 violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 

  

another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days however due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards procedures and penalties we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices the providersponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our company to additional liability and penalties 

  

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations these can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general cms the office of the inspector general of health and human 

  

services the office of personnel management the department of justice the department of labor and state departments of insurance and departments of health these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs or the imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business could be adversely affected 

  

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

  

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may in some cases compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

  

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members ie capitation the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

  

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

  

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc the parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ departments of insurance in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval we are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries one tricare subsidiary under the regions 3 and 4 contract with the department of defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities 

  

increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

  

the health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend   

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer or ceo and chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures including our internal controls over financial reporting for the quarter ended december 31 2003 

  

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures including our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud however they have been designed to give reasonable assurance about the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures including our internal controls over financial reporting a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs control system limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  

based on this evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures including our internal controls over financial reporting are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic sec reports there have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that are reasonably likely to affect those controls over financial reporting during the company’s quarter ended december 31 2003

this annual report on form 10k contains both historical and forwardlooking information see the “cautionary statements” section in item 7 – management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results 

  

business segments 

  

we manage our business with two segments commercial and government the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines of business fully insured medical administrative services only or aso and specialty the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicarechoice medicaid and tricare we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

  

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

  

  

strategy 

  

our business strategy centers on increasing commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the government segment our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumercentric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industryleading electronic capabilities including education tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet the intent of our commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction loyalty and brand awareness we are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our commercial strategy 

  

our products 

  

the following table presents our segment membership premiums and aso fees by product for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

   

our products marketed to commercial segment members 

  

new generation of products 

  

we have developed a range of innovative products that we believe will be a solution for employers who are consistently facing doubledigit premium increases as medical costs also continue to rise at that same level our new generation of products encompass more choices for the individual consumer transparency of provider costs guidance when consumers need it most and benefit designs that engage consumers in the financial implications of the choices they make with respect to their health care innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions including tradeoffs between higher premiums and pointofservice costs at the time consumers choose their plans and ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans these products are sold to employers with humana as the sole carrier but are available as either a fully insured or selffunded option to employers 

  

  

hmo 

  

our health maintenance organization or hmo products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services primary care physicians generally include internists family practitioners and pediatricians generally the member’s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers these other health care providers include among others hospitals nursing homes home health agencies pharmacies mental health and substance abuse centers diagnostic centers optometrists outpatient surgery centers dentists urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers because the primary care physician must generally approve access to many of these other health care providers the hmo product is the most restrictive form of managed care 

  

an hmo member typically through the member’s employer pays a monthly fee which generally covers with some copayments health care services received from or approved by the member’s primary care physician for the year ended december 31 2002 commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately 26 billion or 234 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

ppo 

  

our preferred provider organization or ppo products include some elements of managed health care however they typically include more costsharing with the member through copayments and annual deductibles ppos are also similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider in a ppo the member is encouraged through financial incentives to use participating health care providers which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fees for the year ended december 31 2002 commercial ppo premium revenues totaled approximately 29 billion or 258 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

individual products 

  

in june 2002 we introduced humanaone our first product marketed directly to individuals we have introduced this product in select markets where we can utilize our existing networks and distribution channels 

  

administrative services only 

  

we offer an administrative services only or aso product to those who selfinsure their employee health plans we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer services inquiries from members of selffunded employers these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo and hmo products described above however under aso contracts selffunded employers retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits for the year ended december 31 2002 commercial administrative services fees totaled 1032 million or 09 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

specialty products 

  

we also offer various specialty products including dental group life and shortterm disability at december 31 2002 we had approximately 16 million specialty members for the year ended december 31 2002 specialty product premium revenues were approximately 3373 million or 31 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

  

our products marketed to government segment members 

  

medicarechoice product 

  

medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons certain hospital and medical insurance benefits which include hospitalization benefits for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days each medicareeligible individual is entitled to receive inpatient hospital care known as part a care without the payment of any premium but is required to pay a premium to the federal government which is adjusted annually to be eligible for physician care and other services known as part b care 

  

we contract with cms under the medicarechoice program to provide health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member for medicareeligible individuals residing in the geographic areas in which our hmos operate individuals who elect to participate in medicarechoice programs receive additional benefits not covered by medicare and are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the deductible or coinsurance amounts but are generally required to use exclusively the services provided by the hmo subject to nominal copayments and coinsurance and are required to pay a part b premium to the medicare program 

  

the medicarechoice product involves a contract between an hmo and cms pursuant to which cms makes a fixed monthly payment to the hmo on behalf of each medicareeligible individual that chooses to enroll for coverage in the hmo the fixed monthly payment payable on the first day of a month is determined by formula established by federal law we sometimes receive the fixed monthly payment early due to a weekend or holiday falling on the first day of a month this receipt is significant the timing of which can cause material fluctuation in operating cash flows we also collect additional member premiums from our members in certain of our markets 

  

at december 31 2002 we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately 344100 medicarechoice members for which we received premium revenues of approximately 26 billion or 235 of our total premiums and aso fees for 2002 one such cms contract covered approximately 228400 members in florida and accounted for premium revenues of approximately 17 billion which represented 660 of our medicarechoice premium revenues or 155 of our total premiums and aso fees for 2002 

  

our medicarechoice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a oneyear term each december 31 unless terminated 90 days prior thereto our 2003 average rate of statutory increase under the medicarechoice contracts is approximately 32 over the last five years annual increases have ranged from as low as the january 2001 increase of 19 to as high as 50 in january 2002 with an average of approximately 28 on january 1 2002 we ceased providing our medicarechoice product in 5 counties in kentucky and 1 county in illinois affecting approximately 22000 members on january 1 2003 we exited certain counties in several of our markets affecting about 10000 members these exits were the result in part of lower cms reimbursement rates we are working with cms to develop other alternative offerings for example we are participating in a medicarechoice pilot program offering a private feeforservice product in dupage county illinois and a ppo product in pinellas county florida 

  

tricare 

  

tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents in november 1995 the united states department of defense awarded us our first tricare contract for regions 3 and 4 covering approximately 11 million eligible beneficiaries in florida georgia south carolina mississippi alabama tennessee and eastern louisiana on july 1 1996 we began providing health insurance coverage to these approximately 11 million eligible beneficiaries 

  

  

on may 31 2001 we acquired for 435 million the outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed anthem alliance health insurance company subsidiary responsible for administering tricare benefits for regions 2 and 5 to approximately 12 million eligible members in illinois indiana kentucky michigan a portion of missouri north carolina ohio tennessee virginia wisconsin and west virginia 

  

we currently are in negotiations with the department of defense to extend our tricare contracts that expire on april 30 2003 for regions 2 and 5 and june 30 2003 for regions 3 and 4 we believe we will be able to successfully extend our tricare contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new tricare next generation or tnex transition described below historical pretax profit margins for our tricare business have generally ranged from 2 to 4 percent we expect margins to continue in this range during 2003 

  

the department of defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new tnex program the department of defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract we submitted a bid in january 2003 to participate as a prime contractor for the south region additionally we partnered with aetna government health plans llc a subsidiary of aetna inc to participate as a subcontractor should aetna government health plans llc be awarded the north region an announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late 2003 with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late 2004 at this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract or the effective date of the contract 

  

if we are a successful bidder on the south region we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows although tricare profits could decline slightly tricare membership would not materially change from current levels tricare revenues and expenses would decline by approximately 20 as a result of certain benefits eg pharmacy which are included under our current contract being excluded and under separate tnex contracts in the future 

  

currently three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries in addition to a traditional indemnity option participants may enroll in an hmolike plan with a pointofservice option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers we have subcontracted with third parties to provide various administration and specialty services under the contracts for the year ended december 31 2002 tricare premium revenues were approximately 20 billion or 179 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

at december 31 2002 we had 1048700 tricare aso members for which the department of defense retains the risk of financing the cost of their health benefits we obtained these members from our acquisition of regions 2 and 5 and from two government programs that allow senior members to continue in the tricare program even after becoming medicare eligible which is normally age 65 the first of these programs called tricare senior pharmacy became effective april 1 2001 under this government administrative services program senior tricare members receive certain pharmacy benefits not covered under medicare on october 1 2001 the tricare for life program became effective and expanded coverage to include medical benefits as well we are engaged by the department of defense to provide these administrative services through change orders to our existing tricare contracts once tnex becomes effective our participation in these aso programs will allow us to competitively bid for certain of the services under separate contracts although we will not bid on the tricare for life contract under tnex we may bid on other services under separate tnex contracts anticipated changes to these benefits contracted separately contribute to the expected 20 decline in total tricare revenue discussed above for the year ended december 31 2002 tricare administrative services fees totaled 1412 million or 13 of our total premiums and aso fees 

  

medicaid product 

  

medicaid is a federal program that is stateoperated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to lowincome residents each state that chooses to do so develops through a state specific regulatory agency a 

  

medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable feeforservice basis states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders which apply for entry to the program in either case the contractual relationship with a state is generally for a oneyear period under these contracts we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 

  

effective july 1 2002 we signed two contracts in puerto rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in puerto rico’s medicaid program the term of each of these contracts is three years subject to annual renewal options with the health insurance administration in puerto rico our medicaid contracts in florida and illinois generally are annual contracts for the year ended december 31 2002 premium revenues from our medicaid products totaled 4630 million or 41 of our total premiums and aso fees at december 31 2002 we had approximately 434800 medicaid members in puerto rico or 86 of total medicaid members and 71200 medicaid members in florida and illinois or 14 of total medicaid members 

  

the following table summarizes our medical membership at december 31 2002 by market and product 

  

   

provider arrangements 

  

we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers primary care physicians specialist physicians dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities we have approximately 425000 contracts with health care providers participating in our networks 

  

which consist of approximately 298700 physicians 3100 hospitals and 122000 ancillary providers and dentists these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services medical equipment services home health agencies mental health providers rehabilitation facilities nursing homes optical services and pharmacies our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 

  

we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members these techniques include the coordination of care for our members product and benefit designs hospital inpatient management systems or hims and enrolling members into various disease management programs the focal point for health care services in many of our medicarechoice and hmo networks is the primary care physician who under contract provides services and may control utilization of appropriate services by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of patient care are met our hims programs use specially trained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo members’ medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the members’ discharge and postdischarge care we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure coronary artery disease prenatal and premature infant care asthma related illness end stage renal disease diabetes and breast cancer screening we also may focus on certain rare conditions where disease management techniques benefit members in a more cost effective manner 

  

we typically contract with hospitals on either a per diem rate which is an allinclusive rate per day a case rate which is an allinclusive rate per admission or at a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services outpatient hospital services are generally contracted at a flat rate by type of service or at a discounted charge these contracts are often multiyear agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers are typically contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 

  

our contracts with physicians typically are automatically renewed each year unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 

  

capitation 

  

for 88 of our december 31 2002 medical membership we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership in transferring this risk we prepay these providers a monthly fixedfee per member known as a capitation payment to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing for these capitated hmo arrangements we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from 82 to 89 providers participating in hospitalbased capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership providers participating in physicianbased capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 

  

for 59 of our december 31 2002 medical membership we contract with physicians under risksharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

  

  

physicians under these types of arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician’s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services 

  

the following table presents medical membership under these various arrangements at december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

   

the following table presents capitation expense as a percentage of total medical expense 

  

   

  

accreditation assessment 

  

our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs such as those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies and external accreditation standards we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets or hedis which is used by employers government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance or ncqa to evaluate hmos based on various criteria including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 

  

physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria including licensing patient access office standards afterhours coverage and other factors most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms andor the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations or jcaho 

  

recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years depending on applicable state laws recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical license review of their malpractice liability claims history review of their board certification if applicable and review of any complaints including any member appeals and grievances committees composed of a peer group of physicians review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 

  

we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commissionutilization review accreditation commission or aahcurac accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo accreditation specific to the utilization review process is also required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo certain commercial businesses like those impacted by united auto workers contracts and those where the request comes from the employer require or prefer accredited health plans 

  

ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement credentialing utilization management preventative health and member rights and responsibilities we continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through ncqa three markets maintain ncqa accredited status for all hmo product lines humana health plan of ohio inc in cincinnati ohio excellent humana medical plan inc in north florida commendable and central florida commendable 

  

aahcurac performs reviews of standards for utilization management and for health plan standards in quality management credentialing rights and responsibilities and network management seven markets have achieved urac health plan accreditation for all hmo product lines humana medical plan inc in north florida south florida central florida daytona tampa and orlando humana health plan of ohio inc in cincinnati ohio and humana health plan inc in kentucky and in kansas the atlanta market has urac utilization management accreditation for hmo and ppo product lines aahcurac utilization management accreditation was received for humana military healthcare services inc which administers the tricare program and for the green bay service center 

  

some of our hmo entities are unaccredited because we sought accreditation only where regulatory requirements were in place such as in florida which requires accreditation for hmo licensing or in market areas where commercial groups use it as a variable in choosing carriers as the requirements of accreditation have become less focused on factors under our control and more focused on other factors such as provider behavior we have concluded that these programs do not add value for our customers we are piloting iso 9000 certification as an alternative to accreditation iso is the international standards organization which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process called iso 9000 at this time two clinical programs within the innovation center of humana have received iso registration transplant management and centralized clinical operations providing personal nurse services 

  

  

sales and marketing 

  

individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees we attempt to become an employer’s or group’s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo ppo and specialty products that provide costeffective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of the employees or members 

  

we use various methods to market our commercial medicarechoice and medicaid products including television radio the internet telemarketing and mailings at december 31 2002 we used approximately 39000 licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately 520 licensed employees to sell our commercial products many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums with commissions varying by market and premium volume 

  

at december 31 2002 we employed approximately 610 sales representatives who are each paid a salary andor per member commission to market our medicarechoice and medicaid products in the continental us we also employed approximately 330 telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicarechoice and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members 

  

risk management 

  

through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products in most instances employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage small group reform laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 

  

underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with medicarechoice products because cms regulations require us to accept all eligible medicare applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history we also are not permitted to employ underwriting criteria for the medicaid product but rather we follow cms and state requirements in addition with respect to our tricare business we do not employ any underwriting techniques because we must accept all eligible beneficiaries who choose to participate 

  

competition 

  

the health benefits industry is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid or renewed annually our competitors vary by local market and include other publicly traded managed care companies national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos including hmos and ppos owned by blue crossblue shield plans many of our competitors have larger memberships andor greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete our ability to sell our products and to retain customers is or may be influenced by such factors as benefits pricing contract terms number and quality of participating physicians and other managed health care providers utilization review claims processing administrative efficiency relationships with agents quality of customer service and accreditation results 

  

government regulation 

  

government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret 

  

and enforce laws and rules changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results also it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 

  

enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation’s law enforcement entities the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicarechoice medicaid and the federal employee health benefits program or fehbp we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs the programs are subject to very technical rules when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 

  

we are subject to various governmental audits investigations and enforcement actions these include possible government actions relating to the employee retirement income security act as amended or erisa fehbp federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other laws relating to medicarechoice including adjusted community rating development special payment status and various other areas adjusted community rating development is the governmentdefined rating formula used to justify the medicarechoice benefits we offer individuals eligible for medicare benefits based on a particular community and certain other factors special payment status refers to among others medicarechoice members who are institutionalized medicaideligible or members who have contracted endstage renal disease the medicarechoice plan receives a higher payment for members who qualify for one or more of these statuses we are currently involved in various government investigations audits and reviews some of which are under erisa and the authority of state departments of insurance on may 31 2000 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general for the department of health and human services as part of a settlement of a medicare overpayment issue arising from an audit by the office of the inspector general although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions against us including exclusion from participation in government programs we do not believe the results of any of these actions individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

of our seven licensed and active hmo subsidiaries as of march 1 2003 five are qualified under the federal health maintenance organization act of 1973 as amended to obtain federal qualification an hmo must meet certain requirements including conformance with benefit rating and financial reporting standards in certain markets and for certain products we operate hmos that are not federally qualified because this provides greater flexibility with respect to product design and pricing than is possible for federally qualified hmos 

  

as of march 1 2003 humana medical plan inc humana health plan of texas inc and humana health plan inc each hold cms contracts under the medicarechoice program to sell medicare hmo products in a total of six states in addition humana insurance company holds a cms contract under a medicarechoice pilot program to sell a private feeforservice product in dupage county illinois and a ppo product in pinellas county florida 

  

cms conducts audits of hmos qualified under its medicarechoice program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations these audits include review of the hmos’ administration and management including management information and data collection systems fiscal stability utilization management and physician incentive arrangements health services delivery quality assurance marketing enrollment and disenrollment activity claims processing and complaint systems 

  

  

cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements in addition cms requires certain disclosures to cms and to medicarechoice beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan contracted under the medicarechoice program cms’s rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between an hmo and physicians in the hmos’ networks these rules also require certain levels of stoploss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses relating to patient care depending on the amount of financial risk they assume the reporting of certain health care data contained in hedis is another important cms disclosure requirement 

  

our medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a medicaid product and by the health insurance administration in puerto rico in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies the reviews are similar in nature to those performed by cms 

  

laws in each of the states and the commonwealth of puerto rico in which we operate our hmos ppos and other health insurancerelated services regulate our operations including the scope of benefits rate formulas delivery systems utilization review procedures quality assurance complaint systems enrollment requirements claim payments marketing and advertising the hmo ppo and other health insurancerelated products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators under state laws our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance and our hmos are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health most states’ laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years 

  

our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and commonwealth of puerto rico regulations these regulations generally require among other things prior approval andor notice of new products rates benefit changes and certain material transactions including dividend payments purchases or sales of assets intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company require minimum levels of equity and limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

  

as of december 31 2002 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 10069 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 5760 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level certain states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels some states are in the process of phasing in these rbc requirements over a number of years if rbc were fully implemented by all states at december 31 2002 each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have 3588 million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under rbc 

  

one tricare subsidiary under the regions 3 and 4 contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities we were in compliance with this requirement at december 31 2002 

  

our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business 

  

  

health care reform 

  

there continue to be diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to address aspects of the nation’s health care system 

  

federal 

  

in 2000 congress passed the medicare medicaid and state childrens health benefits improvement and protection act or bipa amending certain provisions of the balanced budget act of 1997 and certain provisions of the medicare medicaid and state children’s health insurance program balanced budget refinement act of 1999 the balanced budget act changed the way health plans are compensated for medicare members by eliminating over five years amounts paid for graduate medical education increasing the blend of national cost factors applied in determining local reimbursement rates over a sixyear phasein period and directing cms to implement a risk adjusted mechanism on its monthly member payment to medicare plans over the same period these changes have had the effect of reducing reimbursement in high cost metropolitan areas with a large number of teaching hospitals congress has subsequently lengthened this timetable to allow the risk adjusted mechanism to be fully implemented by 2007 bipa among other things enacted modest increases to the payment formula for medicarechoice plans while we believe that these increases and modifications restore some medicarechoice reimbursement pending legislative and regulatory initiatives could cause us to again consider increasing enrollee outofpocket costs modifying benefits or exiting markets on january 1 2002 we exited our medicare product in 5 counties in kentucky and 1 county in illinois affecting approximately 22000 members on january 1 2003 we exited certain counties in several of our markets affecting about 10000 members these county exits were the result in part of lower cms reimbursement rates we are working with cms to develop other alternative offerings for example we are participating in a medicarechoice pilot program offering a private feeforservice product in dupage county illinois and a ppo product in pinellas county florida 

  

on november 21 2000 the department of labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under erisa the claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by erisa whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are selffunded as a result the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and unionsponsored health and disability plans except church and government plans similar to legislation recently passed by many states the new erisa claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals according to the department of labor however its erisa claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new erisa regulation impossible unlike its state counterparts the erisa claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions instead the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid statemandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court the new erisa claims and appeals rules generally became effective july 1 2002 or the first day of the first plan year beginning after july 1 2002 whichever is later in any case health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after january 1 2003 

  

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions the compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to october 17 2003 based on our submission of a compliance plan including work plan and implementation strategy to the secretary of health and human services under the new hipaa privacy rules by april 14 2003 we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health 

  

information is disclosed regulations issued in february 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april 21 2005 violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 

  

further in 1999 congress passed the financial services modernization act or gramm leach bliley act that includes provisions related to privacy standards for personal information to be implemented by both the federal government and the states this law became effective in july 2001 many states are currently enacting laws or regulations to implement the federal law we are complying with such provisions 

  

there are several other legislative proposals under consideration that include among other things a patient bill of rights expansion of a patient’s right to sue and mandatory external review of health plan coverage decisions under some versions of this bill our exposure to large jury verdicts could be increased 

  

in addition congress is evaluating proposals to include establishing additional protections for personal health information tax credits for the uninsured proposals to reduce the number of medical errors by health care providers and systems of care and various state and federal purchasing plans to allow individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance also congress is evaluating proposals to expand medicare benefits to cover prescription drugs for medicareeligible seniors including a pharmacy discount card many of these proposals may require additional administrative costs to ensure compliance and we are currently assessing their cost and impact on premiums for the future 

  

state 

  

we continue to encounter regulation on health care claims payment practices at the state level this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties supplemental legislation includes among other provisions claims submission content and electronic submission we view electronic submission as a favorable development that will simplify claims interactions a few states are considering proposals that place new limits on insurer contacts with hospitals and physicians these proposals include provisions to expand payment disclosure limit implementation of claims payment procedures and extend an insurer payment liability where intermediaries fail to pay and restrict recoupment 

  

some states are proposing the creation of small employer pooled purchasing arrangements although these pooled purchasing arrangements may affect the small group market most of the proposals require these purchasing arrangements to comply with the standard small group market regulations similar arrangements enacted in the early 1990s had a very limited affect on the small group insurance market a limited number of states are considering additional restrictions on the use of health status in small group rating mandatefree benefit plans are pending in a number of states some of these proposals could allow insurers more flexibility in the use of member cost sharing there is activity in some states supporting an expansion of disclosure by hospitals physicians and other health care providers of quality and charge data either directly to patients or to state agencies that must make it publicly available 

  

medical malpractice reform is receiving significant attention pending medical malpractice reform proposals differ substantially relative to the entities covered by the reforms since the substance of the reforms remains under discussion and the scope of covered entities has not been resolved in most states management is unable to predict future activity under these laws 

  

we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

  

other 

  

captive insurance company 

  

we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability employee workers’ compensation and officer and director errors and omissions risks professional and general liability risks may include for example medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage we retain these risks through our whollyowned consolidated insurance subsidiary we reduce exposure to our own general business risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third party insurance companies we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses in an effort to minimize credit risk we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings beginning january 1 2002 we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates we provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities related to our captive insurance subsidiary in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements

we also own or lease medical centers ranging in size from approximately 1500 to 80000 square feet we no longer operate most of these medical centers but rather lease them to their provider operators our administrative market offices are generally leased with square footage ranging from approximately 700 to 89000 the following table lists the location of properties we owned or leased at december 31 2002 

  

   

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

securities litigation 

  

in late 1997 three purported class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida by former stockholders of physician corporation of america or pca and certain of its former directors and officers we acquired pca by a merger that became effective on september 8 1997 the three actions were consolidated into a single action entitled in re physician corporation of america securities litigation  the consolidated complaint alleges that pca and the individual defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings with respect to the financial and regulatory difficulties of pca’s workers’ compensation business on may 5 1999 plaintiffs moved for certification of the purported class and on august 25 2000 the defendants moved for summary judgment on january 31 2001 defendants were granted leave to file a thirdparty complaint for declaratory judgment on insurance coverage the defendants seek a determination that the defense costs and liability if any resulting from the class action defense are covered by an insurance policy issued by one insurer and in the alternative declaring that there is coverage under policies issued by two other insurers on april 25 2002 the court dismissed the thirdparty complaint without prejudice finding that it could be refiled in the future if the insurance claims are not otherwise resolved on july 24 2002 the court denied the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and set the case on the court’s trial calendar for december 2 2002 the court subsequently postponed the trial the court is expected to set a date which is 90 days after it rules on the plaintiff’s motion for class certification 

  

managed care industry purported class action litigation 

  

we are involved in several purported class action lawsuits that are part of a wave of generally similar actions that target the health care payer industry and particularly target managed care companies as a result of action by the judicial panel on multi district litigation most of the cases against us as well as similar cases against other companies in the industry have been consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and are styled in re managed care litigation  the cases include separate suits against us and five other managed care companies that purport to have been brought on behalf of members which are referred to as the subscriber track cases and a single action against us and eight other companies that purports to have been brought on behalf of providers which is referred to as the provider track case 

  

in the subscriber track cases the plaintiffs seek a recovery under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act or rico for all persons who are or were subscribers at any time during the fouryear period prior to the filing of the complaints plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of policyholders who purchased insurance through their employers’ health benefit plans governed by erisa and who are or were subscribers at any time during the sixyear period prior to the filing of the complaints the complaints allege among other things that we intentionally concealed from members certain information concerning the way in which we conduct business including the methods by which we pay providers the plaintiffs do not allege that any of the purported practices resulted in denial of any claim for a particular benefit but instead claim that we provided the purported class with health insurance benefits of lesser value than promised the complaints also allege an industrywide conspiracy to engage in the various alleged improper practices 

  

on february 20 2002 the court issued its ruling on the defendants’ motions to dismiss the second consolidated amended complaint the “amended complaint” the amended complaint was filed on june 29 2001 after the court dismissed most of the claims in the original complaints but granted leave to refile in its february 20 2002 ruling the court dismissed the rico claims of ten of the sixteen named plaintiffs including three of the four involving us on the ground that the mccarranferguson act prohibited their claims because they interfered with the state regulatory processes in the states in which they resided florida new jersey california and virginia with respect to erisa the court dismissed the misrepresentation claims of current members finding that they have adequate remedies under the law and failed to exhaust administrative remedies claims for former members were not dismissed the court also refused to dismiss claims by all plaintiffs for breach of fiduciary duty arising from alleged interference with the doctorpatient relationship by the use of socalled “gag clauses” that assertedly prohibited doctors from freely communicating with members the plaintiffs 

  

sought certification of a class consisting of all members of our medical plans excluding medicare and medicaid plans for the period from 1990 to 1999 on september 26 2002 the court denied the plaintiffs’ request for class certification on october 9 2002 the plaintiffs asked the court to reconsider its ruling on that issue the court denied the motion on november 25 2002 the court has set a trial date on the individual named plaintiffs’ claims for september 22 2003 

  

in the provider track case the plaintiffs assert that we and other defendants improperly paid providers’ claims and “downcoded” their claims by paying lesser amounts than they submitted the complaint alleges among other things multiple violations under rico as well as various breaches of contract and violations of regulations governing the timeliness of claim payments we moved to dismiss the provider track complaint on september 8 2000 and the other defendants filed similar motions thereafter on march 2 2001 the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to the defendants’ several motions to dismiss however the court allowed the plaintiffs to attempt to correct the deficiencies in their complaint with an amended pleading with respect to all of the allegations except a claim under the federal medicare regulations which was dismissed with prejudice the court also left undisturbed the plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract on march 26 2001 the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint which among other things added four state or county medical associations as additional plaintiffs two of those the denton county medical society and the texas medical association purport to bring their actions against us as well as against several other defendant companies the medical association of georgia and the california medical association purport to bring their actions against various other defendant companies the associations seek injunctive relief only the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on april 30 2001 

  

on september 26 2002 the court granted the plaintiffs’ request to file a second amended complaint adding additional plaintiffs including the florida medical association which purports to bring its action against all defendants on october 21 2002 the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint the court has not yet ruled 

  

also on september 26 2002 the court certified a global class consisting of all medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by any defendant from august 4 1990 to september 30 2002 the class includes two subclasses a national subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by a defendant when the doctor has a claim against such defendant and is not required to arbitrate that claim a california subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured in california by any defendant when the doctor was not bound to arbitrate the claim on october 10 2002 the defendants asked the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to review the class certification decision on november 20 2002 the court of appeals agreed to review the class issue the district court has ruled that discovery can proceed during the pendency of the request to the eleventh circuit and the eleventh circuit rejected a request to halt discovery 

  

the court has set a trial date of december 8 2003 

  

other 

  

the academy of medicine of cincinnati the butler county medical society the northern kentucky medical society and several physicians have filed antitrust suits against aetna health inc humana health plan of ohio inc anthem blue cross blue shield and united healthcare of ohio inc alleging that the defendants have conspired to fix the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the greater cincinnati and northern kentucky region the companion suits are filed in state courts in ohio and kentucky and allege violation respectively of the ohio and kentucky antitrust laws each suit seeks class certification damages and injunctive relief plaintiffs cite no evidence that any such conspiracy existed but base their allegations on assertions that physicians in the greater cincinnati region are paid less than physicians in other major cities in ohio and kentucky 

  

the hamilton county court of common pleas ohio and the boone county circuit court kentucky have denied motions by the defendants to compel arbitration or alternatively to dismiss defendants have filed notices 

  

of appeal with respect to the orders denying arbitration the ohio court has agreed to stay proceedings pending resolution of the appeal and a similar request has been filed with the kentucky court the plaintiffs have filed motions to certify a class in each case the purported classes allegedly consist respectively of all physicians who have practiced medicine at any time since january 1 1992 in a four county region in southwestern ohio or a three county region in northern kentucky 

  

we intend to continue to defend these actions vigorously 

  

government audits and other litigation and proceedings 

  

in july 2000 the office of the florida attorney general initiated an investigation apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the purported class action lawsuits described above while the attorney general has filed no action against us he has indicated that he may do so in the future on september 21 2001 the texas attorney general initiated a similar investigation these investigations are ongoing and we have cooperated with the regulators in both states 

  

on may 31 2000 we entered into a fiveyear corporate integrity agreement or cia with the office of inspector general or oig of the department of health and human services under the cia we are obligated to among other things provide training conduct periodic audits and make periodic reports to the oig 

  

in addition our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities there has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the managed health care companies’ business practices including claims payment practices and utilization management practices we have been and continue to be subject to such reviews some of these have resulted in fines and could require changes in some of our practices and could also result in additional fines or other sanctions 

  

we also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations including claims of medical malpractice both for direct negligence and for vicarious liability for negligence of network providers bad faith nonacceptance or termination of providers failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements and challenges to subrogation practices we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers and others including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims in addition some courts recently have issued decisions which could have the effect of eroding the scope of erisa preemption thereby exposing us to greater liability for medical negligence claims 

  

personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted in addition insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future beginning january 1 2002 we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates 

  

we do not believe that any pending or threatened legal actions against us or audits by agencies will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits like the purported class action lawsuits described above or governmental investigations cannot be accurately predicted with certainty in addition the increased litigation which has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry adds to this uncertainty therefore such legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

introduction 

  

headquartered in louisville kentucky humana inc is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies based on our 2002 revenues of 113 billion we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internetbased plans for employer groups governmentsponsored programs and individuals as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 66 million members in our medical insurance programs as well as approximately 16 million members in our specialty products programs we have approximately 425000 contracts with physicians hospitals dentists and other providers to provide health care to our members in 2002 approximately 70 of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in florida illinois texas kentucky and ohio we derived approximately 44 of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government in 2002 under two federal government contracts with the department of defense we provide health insurance coverage to tricare members accounting for approximately 19 of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002 under one federal government contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 228400 medicarechoice members in florida accounting for approximately 16 of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002 

  

we manage our business with two segments commercial and government the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals and includes three lines of business fully insured medical administrative services only or aso and specialty the government segment consists of members enrolled in governmentsponsored programs and includes three lines of business medicarechoice medicaid and tricare we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 131 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing benefits and underwriting requirements 

  

the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes we allocate all selling general and administrative expenses investment and other income interest expense and goodwill but no other assets or liabilities to our segments members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers our segments also share overhead costs and assets as a result the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

  

our business strategy centers on increasing commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the government segment our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses 

  

on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumercentric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industryleading electronic capabilities including education tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet the intent of our commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction loyalty and brand awareness we are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our commercial strategy 

  

restructuring charge 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we finalized a plan to reduce our administrative cost structure with the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprisewide workforce reduction 

  

the following table presents the components of the restructuring charge we recorded for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

   

severance 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded severance and related employee benefit costs of 321 million 196 million after tax in connection with customer service center consolidation and an enterprisewide workforce reduction severance costs were estimated based upon the provisions of the company’s existing employee benefit plans and policies the plan to reduce our administrative cost structure is expected to affect approximately 2600 positions throughout the entire organization including customer service claim administrations clinical operations provider network administration as well as other corporate and fieldbased positions as part of the plan we expect to hire approximately 300 employees to support newly consolidated operations thereby resulting in a net reduction of approximately 2300 employees as of december 31 2002 approximately 500 positions had been eliminated we expect the remaining positions to be eliminated by december 31 2003 with most of the severance being paid in 2003 

  

as a result of these actions we expect a reduction in historical compensation expense will improve our pretax results by approximately 70 million 43 million after tax in 2003 and 110 million 67 million after tax annually thereafter and after tax cash flows from operating activities by approximately 13 million in 2003 including estimated severance payments of approximately 30 million and 65 million annually thereafter 

  

longlived asset impairment 

  

our decision to eliminate three customer service centers prompted a review during the fourth quarter of 2002 for the possible impairment of longlived assets used in these operations we will continue to use some longlived assets associated with these customer service center operations until mid2003 the expected completion date for consolidating these operations we are currently evaluating alternatives with respect to future use of these longlived assets including possible sale 

  

our impairment review indicated that future estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to our business supported by our san antonio texas customer service operations were insufficient to recover the carrying value 

  

of certain longlived assets primarily buildings used in these operations accordingly we adjusted the carrying value of these longlived assets to their estimated fair value resulting in a noncash impairment charge of 24 million 15 million after tax estimated fair value was based on an independent third party appraisal of the buildings 

  

by the end of the first quarter of 2003 we expect the estimated future undiscounted cash flow attributable to our business supported by our jacksonville florida customer service operations will be insufficient to recover the carrying value of additional longlived assets primarily a building used in our florida operations accordingly we expect to record a noncash impairment charge of approximately 172 million 105 million after tax during the first quarter of 2003 additionally we expect to record a noncash impairment charge of approximately 135 million during the first quarter of 2003 83 million after tax related to accelerated depreciation of software we will cease using with these operations 

  

as a result of these actions we expect a reduction in historical depreciation and rent expense will improve our pretax results by approximately 5 million 3 million after tax in 2003 and 6 million 4 million after tax annually thereafter the impact on operating cash flows is not expected to be material 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities goodwill and longlived assets these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events and accordingly actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

medical cost recognition 

  

medical costs include claim payments capitation payments allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided prior to the balance sheet date capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to primary care physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other medical expense payments using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical cost inflation historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors and record medical claims reserves for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 

  

medical cost inflation among other items may significantly impact our estimate of medical costs medical cost inflationary trends today are substantially higher than other segments of the economy in the early 1990’s employerdriven migration to hmo enrollment was popular and resulted in several years of very low medical cost trends today there are very few economic forces existing to mitigate increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services prescription drugs and new medical technologies and the inflationary trend on the cost per unit for each of these expense components additionally as we are realigning our operating model around our commercial strategy we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services monitoring of inpatient admissions and requirements for physician referrals other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes catastrophes and epidemics may also impact cost trends 

  

  

any of the items above or other unforeseen circumstances may result in actual medical cost trends differing materially from our estimates and a relatively small variance between our estimates of medical cost trends and actual trends could have a material impact either favorable or unfavorable on the adequacy of our medical claims reserves and our overall financial position for example a 100 basis point or 1 percent change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at december 31 2002 which represents 39 of total liabilities would require an adjustment of 114 million in a future period in which the revision in the estimate becomes known a 100 basis point change in estimated medical expense trends would have changed annual pretax results of our commercial segment by 487 million and our government segment by 427 million in 2002 

  

note 5 in our consolidated financial statements presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances for medical and other expenses payable the table includes the changes in estimates of medical claims payable subsequently recorded to each year a summary of these changes in estimates and percentage of beginning medical claim reserves follows 

  

   

revenue recognition 

  

we generally establish oneyear commercial membership contracts with employer groups subject to cancellation by the employer group’s written notice our tricare contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs are generally multiyear contracts subject to annual renewal provisions our medicarechoice contracts with the federal government renew annually we bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and some individual medicarechoice members monthly we receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms 

  

premium revenues are recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services and are net of estimated uncollectible amounts and retroactive membership adjustments retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed or not yet reported by an employer group or the government we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts the aging of receivables historical retroactivity trends as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and any required adjustments are reflected in current operations 

  

administrative services only fees or aso are earned as services are performed administrative services fees cover the processing of claims offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs and responding to customer service inquiries from members of selffunded employers under aso contracts selffunded employers and for tricare aso the department of defense retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits 

  

premium and aso receivables are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 

  

  

tricare revenues 

  

base premium revenues as originally specified in our tricare contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services tricare revenues also include estimates for amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of bid price adjustments or bpas and change orders 

  

under our tricare contracts we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks samestore utilization of services and administrative overhead however the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities or mtf changes in the number of persons eligible for tricare benefits and medical unit cost inflation bpas are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk we work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and mtf workload data and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual bpa requirements we record revenues applicable to bpas when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured because final settlement of bpas occurs only at specified intervals typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions cumulative amounts receivable or payable under bpas may be outstanding in excess of a year amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses respectively in our consolidated balance sheets amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other longterm assets or other longterm liabilities respectively as a result of the events of september 11 2001 the subsequent buildup of military personnel to support military operations in afghanistan and the continuing buildup of military personnel surrounding other international tensions the magnitude of bpa activity is currently much more significant than in prior years 

  

tricare change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price which results in additional premium revenues examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for tricare beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as tricare for life and tricare senior pharmacy like bpas we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured unlike bpas where settlement only occurs at specified intervals change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year 

  

total tricare premium and aso fee receivables at december 31 2002 and 2001 are as follows 

  

   

  

our tricare contracts also contain risksharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts amounts receivable from the federal government under such risksharing provisions are included in the bpa receivable above while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately 23 million are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

investment securities 

  

investment securities totaled 16946 million or 37 of total assets at december 31 2002 debt securities totaled 16375 million or 97 of our total investment portfolio the average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3 years and more than 95 of our debt securities were of investmentgrade quality with an average of aa by standard  poor’s at december 31 2002 most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the noninvestment grade spectrum our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 

  

our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and as a result are stated at fair value fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices non traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor fair value of strategic venture capital debt and equity securities that are privately held or where an observable quoted market price does not exist are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows unrealized holding gains and losses net of applicable deferred taxes are included as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized from a sale or impairment 

  

gross unrealized losses totaled 126 million or 07 of our total investment portfolio at december 31 2002 compared to 195 million or 12 at december 31 2001 we had no material unrealized loss on any one individual investment security or within any one industry at december 31 2002 we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment we consider factors affecting the investee factors affecting the industry the investee operates within and general debt and equity market trends we consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 

  

gross realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of 196 million related to privately held investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary 

  

goodwill and longlived asset 

  

at december 31 2002 goodwill and other longlived assets represented 28 of total assets and 79 of total stockholders’ equity 

  

  

goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments the commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of fully and selfinsured medical and specialty the government segment’s three reporting units consist of medicarechoice tricare and medicaid goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition if goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of january 1 2002 based upon the reporting units’ relative fair value this process resulted in the allocation of 6332 million of goodwill to the commercial segment and 1437 million of goodwill to the government segment 

  

our longrange business plan and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios we used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weightedaverage cost of capital key assumptions including changes in membership premium yields medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our longrange business plan and annual planning process if these assumptions differ from actual the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected 

  

longlived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life and are subject to impairment reviews we periodically review longlived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable in assessing recoverability we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist and if so estimate fair value we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our longlived assets if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life including accelerating depreciation for these assets in 2002 we recognized longlived asset impairment losses of 24 million as a result of our decision to eliminate three customer service centers we expect to recognize additional longlived asset impairment losses of approximately 307 million in 2003 related to these service center consolidation initiatives see “restructuring charge” section and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

recent transactions 

  

acquisitions 

  

on may 31 2001 we acquired the outstanding shares of common stock of a newlyformed anthem health insurance company subsidiary responsible for administering tricare benefits in regions 2 and 5 for 435 million in cash net of direct transaction costs 

  

during 2000 in separate transactions we acquired a houstonbased health plan two operating shell entities for future business initiatives and a hospital inpatient management services firm for 763 million in cash net of direct transaction costs 

  

we accounted for each of these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly our consolidated results of operations include the results of the acquired businesses from the date of acquisition for each acquisition we allocated the purchase price to net tangible and other intangible assets based upon their fair values any remaining value not assigned to net tangible or other intangible assets was then allocated to goodwill other intangible assets primarily relate to government subscriber and provider contracts and the cost of the acquired licenses goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions were 448 million in 2001 and 521 million in 2000 the other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 20 years with a weighted average life of 57 years unaudited pro forma results of operations information have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions individually or in the aggregate were not significant to our results of operations or financial position 

  

  

divestitures 

  

during 2000 we completed transactions to divest our workers’ compensation north florida medicaid and medicare supplement businesses we estimated and recorded a 1172 million loss in 1999 related to these divestitures there was no subsequent change in the estimated loss divested assets consisting primarily of investment securities and reinsurance recoverables totaled 6519 million divested liabilities consisting primarily of workers’ compensation and other reserves totaled 4376 million cash proceeds received in 2000 were 971 million net of direct transaction costs revenue associated with these businesses prior to divestiture for 2000 totaled 1029 million or less than 1 of our consolidated 2000 revenues pretax losses totaled 84 million in 2000 related to these businesses 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

  

on january 1 2003 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 146 accounting for exit or disposal activities  or statement 146 statement 146 addresses the recognition measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities including certain lease termination costs and severancetype costs under a onetime benefit arrangement rather than an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferredcompensation contract statement 146 requires liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as incurred and will impact the timing of recognition for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 the effect of the adoption is dependent on exit or disposal activities if any initiated after december 31 2002 

  

in november 2002 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34  or fin 45 fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee fin 45 requires disclosure about each guarantee even if the likelihood of the guarantor’s having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december 31 2002 we do not expect the adoption of the recognition provision of fin 45 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows the disclosure provisions of fin 45 are effective for our december 31 2002 financial statements see “liquidity” section and note 12 in our consolidated financial statements for guarantee disclosures 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 51 or fin 46 the primary objectives of fin 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting right variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary the provisions of fin 46 are effective immediately for vies created after january 31 2003 and no later than july 1 2003 for vies created before february 1 2003 in addition fin 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest make additional disclosure in filings issued after january 31 2003 the adoption of fin 46 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued statement no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure  or statement 148 this statement amends fasb statement no 123 accounting for stockbased compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results see notes 2 and 9 in our consolidated financial statements for our stock option 

  

accounting policy and required disclosures as now required by statement 148 these disclosures will be updated each reporting period beginning with the first quarter of 2003 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2002 and 2001 

  

the following table presents certain financial data for our two segments 

  

   

  

the following table presents our medical membership at december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

   

overview 

  

net income was 1428 million or 085 per diluted share in 2002 compared to net income of 1172 million or 070 per diluted share in 2001 the increase in earnings resulted primarily from premium revenues increasing more than operating costs in both our commercial and government segments and the nonamortization of goodwill partially offset by the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring charge 

  

premium revenues and medical membership 

  

premium revenues increased 101 to 109 billion for 2002 compared to 99 billion for 2001 higher premium revenues resulted primarily from significant commercial premium yields and an increase in tricare premiums premium yield represents the percentage increase in the average premium per member over the comparable period in the prior year items impacting premium yield include changes in premium rates changes in government reimbursement rates changes in geographic mix of membership and changes in the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership 

  

commercial segment premium revenues increased 115 to 58 billion for 2002 compared to 52 billion for 2001 this increase resulted primarily from premium yields in the 12 to 14 range for 2002 on our fully insured commercial business additionally our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 17 or 39000 members to 2340300 at december 31 2002 compared to 2301300 at december 31 2001 

  

we have been pricing 2003 premiums using the assumption that medical cost trends will accelerate slightly and accordingly anticipate 2003 commercial premium yields in the 13 to 15 range during 2003 we anticipate an increase in our fully insured commercial and administrative services discussed below medical membership of approximately 4 to 5 

  

government segment premium revenues increased 85 to 51 billion for 2002 compared to 47 billion for 2001 this increase was primarily attributable to our tricare business partially offset by a reduction in our medicarechoice membership 

  

tricare premium revenues were 20 billion an increase of 660 million or 492 compared to 2001 334 million of the increase in tricare premium revenues is attributable to the acquisition of regions 2 and 5 on may 31 2001 with the remainder of the increase attributable to the annual increase in our contractually determined base revenues and increases in premium revenues recorded as a result of bid price adjustments or bpas and change orders 

  

  

increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with bpas resulted from an increase in the number of eligible tricare beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities or mtfs by tricare beneficiaries the number of tricare beneficiaries has increased as a result of the events of september 11 2001 the subsequent buildup of military personnel to support military operations in afghanistan and the continuing buildup of military personnel surrounding other international tensions a decline in the usage of mtfs occurred for some periods after september 11 2001 when certain mtfs were restricted by the department of defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for tricare beneficiaries as mandated by congress which includes among other items a reduction of beneficiary outofpocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments 

  

collectively all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during 2002 since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and bid price adjustment process we recognized revenues related to these adjustments when the settlement amount became determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured 

  

medicarechoice premium revenues were 26 billion in 2002 a decrease of 96 from 29 billion in 2001 medicarechoice membership was 344100 at december 31 2002 compared to 393900 at december 31 2001 a decline of 49800 members or 126 premium yield was 56 for 2002 the decrease in membership was due to our exit of various counties on january 1 2002 as well as attrition of some members selecting other plans in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs effective january 1 2003 we exited several counties in some of our markets affecting approximately 10000 members we expect that by the end of 2003 medicarechoice membership will be approximately 325000 to 330000 members 

  

administrative services fees 

  

administrative services fees for 2002 were 2444 million an increase of 1073 million from 1371 million for 2001 for the commercial segment administrative services fees increased 190 million or 226 to 1032 million this increase corresponds to the higher level of aso membership at december 31 2002 which was 652200 members compared to 592500 members at december 31 2001 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member administrative services fees for the government segment increased 883 million when comparing 2002 to 2001 51 million of this increase was due to the tricare regions 2 and 5 acquisition with the remainder attributable to the implementation of the tricare for life benefits program effective october 1 2001 tricare for life is a program for seniors where we provide medical benefit administrative services 

  

investment and other income 

  

investment and other income totaled 864 million in 2002 a decrease of 324 million from 1188 million in 2001 net realized losses of 101 million in 2002 compared to net realized gains of 139 million in 2001 net realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of 196 million related to privately held venture capital investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary lower interest rates also decreased investment income 109 million in 2002 compared to 2001 the average yield on investment securities was 46 in 2002 declining from 51 in 2001 

  

medical expense 

  

total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues or medical expense ratio for 2002 was 836 increasing 30 basis points from 833 for 2001 

  

the commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 835 increasing 40 basis points from 831 for 2001 this increase primarily was due to the shift in the mix of our fully insured commercial medical 

  

membership to a heavier concentration of larger group sizes large group commercial membership represents approximately 65 of our fully insured commercial membership at december 31 2002 compared to 62 at december 31 2001 large group membership traditionally experiences a higher medical expense ratio and a lower selling general and administrative expense ratio than does our small group membership 

  

the government segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 838 increasing 20 basis points from 836 for 2001 this increase primarily was attributable to tricare as discussed previously tricare medical expense increased due to expanded benefits for tricare beneficiaries mandated by congress an increase in eligible beneficiaries and an increase in the use of humana’s provider network rather than military treatment facilities since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts or were for items that the department of defense retains financial risk we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment processes these higher medical expenses combined with the associated higher premium revenues resulted in an overall increase in the government medical expense ratio 

  

sga expense 

  

total selling general and administrative or sga expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees or sga expense ratio for 2002 was 156 increasing 30 basis points from 153 for 2001 during the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded 301 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of physician corporation of america or pca of the total 301 million of administrative expenses which amounts to a 30 basis point increase in the 2002 sga expense ratio 284 million impacted our commercial segment and 17 million impacted our government segment 

  

the commercial segment’s sga expense ratio was 175 for 2002 decreasing 10 basis points from 2001 of 176 the pca items discussed above accounted for a 30 basis point increase in this ratio the remaining 40 basis point decline in the sga ratio was driven primarily by the changing mix of members towards more larger group members and reductions in the number of our employees due to operational efficiencies gained from streamlining various processes through technology and other initiatives costs to distribute and administer our products to large group members are lower than that of small group members 

  

the government segment’s sga expense ratio was 133 for 2002 increasing 50 basis points compared to 128 in 2001 this increase resulted from a higher proportion of revenues generated from administrative services fees primarily from the tricare regions 2 and 5 acquisition and the implementation of the tricare for life benefit programs effective october 1 2001 as discussed above aso business carries a much higher sga ratio than fully insured business 

  

we expect our total sga expense ratio to decline by approximately 80 basis points in 2003 due to our plan to realign our operating model around our commercial strategy and reductions in our administrative cost structure including the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprisewide workforce reduction 

  

depreciation and amortization was 1207 million in 2002 a decrease of 408 million or 253 from 1615 million in 2001 on a comparable basis depreciation and amortization was 1065 in 2001 excluding goodwill amortization expense the 142 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001 as adjusted results from capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the tricare acquisition of regions 2 and 5 on may 31 2001 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 173 million in 2002 a decrease of 80 million from 253 million in 2001 this decrease primarily resulted from lower interest rates 

  

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate in 2002 of 32 decreased 4 compared to the 36 effective tax rate in 2001 the lower effective tax rate in 2002 primarily resulted from the cessation of nondeductible goodwill amortization on january 1 2002 partially offset by higher state income taxes and a lower proportion of taxexempt investment income to pretax income in addition during 2002 the internal revenue service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately 326 million this was offset by an increase of approximately 245 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate we expect the effective tax rate for 2003 to increase to approximately 36 as a result of a lower proportion of taxexempt investment income to pretax income and because we are not currently anticipating any favorable adjustments resulting from the completion of any irs tax examinations during 2003 

  

comparison of results of operations for 2001 and 2000 

  

the following table presents certain financial data for our two segments 

  

   

  

the following table presents our medical membership at december 31 2001 and 2000 

  

   

overview 

  

net income was 1172 million or 070 per diluted share in 2001 compared to net income of 901 million or 054 per diluted share in 2000 this increase in earnings occurred despite an increase in our effective income tax rate from 21 in 2000 to 36 in 2001 the earnings increase resulted primarily from significant medicarechoice benefit reductions improvements in determining appropriate premiums for our fully insured commercial medical membership a process we refer to as pricing discipline and divestitures of those products and markets that either lacked the prospect for longterm profitability or no longer fit our strategic focus 

  

premium revenues and medical membership 

  

premium revenues decreased 44 to 99 billion for 2001 compared to 104 billion for 2000 this decrease was due to medical membership reductions from exiting numerous markets and products partially offset by higher premium revenues from our tricare acquisition on may 31 2001 and premium yields in our commercial and medicarechoice products 

  

commercial segment premium revenues decreased 56 to 52 billion for 2001 compared to 56 billion for 2000 this decrease was due to membership reductions partially offset by premium yields on our fully insured commercial business our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 96 or 244500 members to 2301300 at december 31 2001 compared to 2545800 at december 31 2000 as we continued to focus on opportunities that satisfy our pricing criteria and exit noncore businesses 

  

government segment premium revenues decreased 30 to 47 billion for 2001 compared to 48 billion for 2000 this decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in our medicarechoice and medicaid membership partially offset by higher medicarechoice premium yield in 2001 and higher premium revenues from our tricare acquisition on may 31 2001 medicarechoice membership was 393900 at december 31 2001 compared to 494200 at december 31 2000 a decline of 100300 members or 203 this decline in membership primarily was attributable to the exits from 45 medicare counties on january 1 2001 medicaid membership was 490800 at december 31 2001 compared to 575600 at december 31 2000 a decline of 84800 members this decline resulted primarily from the divestiture of our north florida milwaukee wisconsin and austin san antonio and houston texas medicaid businesses for 2001 tricare premiums were 13 billion compared to 8924 million for 2000 an increase of 4492 million fully insured tricare membership increased by 644300 members or 602 to 1714600 at december 31 2001 compared to 1070300 at december 31 2000 due to the tricare regions 2 and 5 acquisition on may 31 2001 this acquisition increased tricare fully insured medical members by approximately 648000 members

administrative services fees for 2001 were 1371 million an increase of 508 million from 863 million for 2000 this increase primarily was due to the tricare regions 2 and 5 acquisition and servicing medical benefits in an administrative capacity under a new tricare program for seniors called tricare for life which began october 1 2001 

  

investment and other income 

  

investment and other income totaled 1188 million in 2001 an increase of 38 million from 1150 million in 2000 the increased investment and other income resulted from higher average invested balances partially offset by lower interest rates 

  

medical expense 

  

total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues or medical expense ratio for 2001 was 833 decreasing 120 basis points from 845 for 2000 the improvement in the medical expense ratio primarily was due to significant benefit reductions in our medicarechoice product effective january 1 2001 continued discipline in commercial pricing and the exit of numerous higher cost markets and products during 2000 

  

the commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 831 decreasing 50 basis points from 836 for 2000 the improvement in our commercial medical expense ratio resulted primarily from exercising pricing discipline in our fully insured accounts 

  

the government segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 836 decreasing 190 basis points from 855 for 2000 this improvement primarily resulted from exiting 45 noncore counties in our medicarechoice business with higher medical expense ratios on january 1 2001 coupled with significant benefit design changes which also became effective on that date 

  

sga expense 

  

total selling general and administrative or sga expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees or sga expense ratio for 2001 was 153 increasing 80 basis points from 145 in 2000 similar increases occurred in the sga expense ratios of our commercial and government segments as indicated in the preceding table these increases resulted from an increase in the mix of aso membership primarily from the tricare acquisition and planned spending on infrastructure and technology initiatives 

  

depreciation and amortization was 1615 million in 2001 an increase of 150 million or 102 from 1465 million in 2000 this increase was the result of increased capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the tricare acquisition on may 31 2001 

  

interest expense 

  

interest expense was 253 million in 2001 a decrease of 33 million from 286 million in 2000 this decline was attributable to the impact from lower interest rates that were offset by higher average daily outstanding borrowings a greater proportion of total debt outstanding during 2001 resulted from borrowings under our credit agreement and later in the year under the 5year senior notes issued in august 2001 these borrowings have longer maturities than borrowings under our commercial paper program resulting in higher daily average outstanding borrowings in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of this changing debt mix daily cash in excess of our funding requirements was invested causing higher average invested balances described above 

  

  

income taxes 

  

our effective tax rate in 2001 was approximately 36 compared to a 21 effective tax rate in 2000 the lower effective tax rate in 2000 was the result of recognizing the benefit of capital loss carryforwards resulting from the sale of our workers’ compensation business 

  

liquidity 

  

the following table presents operating cash flows for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 excluding the effects of the timing of the medicarechoice premium receipts 

  

   

the medicarechoice premium receipt is payable to us on the first day of each month when the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday we receive this payment at the end of the previous month this receipt is significant the timing of which can cause material fluctuation in operating cash flows normalized operating cash flows assume these monthly receipts were received in the month in which they are applicable providing a better comparison 

  

normalized operating cash flows were 3323 million in 2002 compared to 1658 million in 2001 an increase of 1665 million this increase primarily was attributable to higher net income and an increase in medical and other expenses payable partially offset by higher tricare receivables medical and other expenses payable increased 557 million during 2002 primarily as a result of membership growth the timing of our payment to our thirdparty pharmacy benefit administrator and increases in medical claims trend partially offset by a reduction in unprocessed claim inventories and a decrease in claim receipt cycle time medical and other expenses payable declined 1795 million during 2001 due to reductions in both unprocessed claim inventories onhand and membership levels 

  

throughout 2001 and to a lesser extent during 2002 we reduced the level of unprocessed claim inventories a direct result of our focused effort to improve service and operational efficiencies the pace of claim inventory reduction slowed during 2002 to 331 million compared to 1320 million for 2001 the following table presents the estimated valuation and number of unprocessed claims on hand claims on hand represent the estimated number of provider requests for reimbursement that have been received but not yet processed 

  

   

  

total net premium and aso receivables increased to 4169 million or 278 during 2002 primarily related to tricare as presented in the following table 

  

   

tricare receivables increased primarily due to change orders and bid price adjustments previously discussed we collect the tricare base receivables monthly in the ordinary course of business the timing of bpa collections occurs at contractually specified intervals typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions we classified a portion of the total bpa receivables associated with our regions 3 and 4 tricare contract as longterm because the federal government is not obligated to pay us the amounts until january 2004 we also have a bpa amount payable within one year under the regions 3 and 4 contract of approximately 23 million at december 31 2002 which is classified in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year we expect to collect the change order receivable balance of 576 million no later than the second quarter of 2003 due to the buildup of military personnel and other items previously discussed we expect tricare receivables to increase from the 359 million level at december 31 2002 to a range of 415 million to 465 million at december 31 2003 

  

the allowance for doubtful accounts of 302 million at december 31 2002 which relates entirely to commercial and other receivables decreased from 385 million at december 31 2001 this decline resulted from a reduction in past due accounts improved collections and operating efficiencies related to the billing and enrollment system 

  

capital expenditures 

  

our ongoing capital expenditures relate primarily to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing billing and collections medical utilization review and customer service total capital expenditures excluding acquisitions were 1121 million in 2002 1155 million in 2001 and 1351 million in 2000 excluding acquisitions we expect our total capital expenditures in 2003 to be approximately 105 million most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities 

  

stock repurchase plan 

  

in july 2002 the board of directors authorized the use of up to 100 million in total for the repurchase of our common shares the shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the openmarket by block purchases or in privatelynegotiated transactions we have engaged lehman brothers inc and banc of america securities llc to broker these transactions as of december 31 2002 we had purchased 64 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of 740 million or 1156 per share since december 31 2002 and 

  

through february 26 2003 we had purchased 22 million more shares for an aggregate purchase price of 208 million or 931 per share the total remaining share repurchase authorization as of february 26 2003 was 52 million 

  

debt 

  

the following table presents our shortterm and longterm debt outstanding at december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

   

senior notes 

  

the 300 million 7¼ senior unsecured notes are due august 1 2006 

  

in order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our 300 million 7¼ senior notes attributable to fluctuations in interest rates we entered into interest rate swap agreements interest rate swap agreements which are considered derivatives are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount or notional amount for a specified period our interest rate swap agreements exchange the 7¼ fixed interest rate under our senior notes for a variable interest rate which was 306 at december 31 2002 the 300 million swap agreements mature on august 1 2006 and have the same critical terms as our senior notes changes in the fair value of the 7¼ senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness 

  

our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes the fair value of our swap agreements are estimated based on quoted market prices of comparable agreements and reflects the amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date at december 31 2002 the 349 million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other longterm assets likewise the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased 349 million to its fair value the counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships 

  

credit agreements 

  

we maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a 265 million 4year revolving credit agreement and a 265 million 364day revolving credit agreement with a oneyear term out option a one year term out option converts the outstanding borrowings if any under the credit agreement to a one year term loan upon expiration the 4year revolving credit agreement expires in october 2005 in october 2002 we renewed the 364day revolving credit agreement which expires in october 2003 unless extended 

  

there were no balances outstanding under either agreement at december 31 2002 under these agreements at our option we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis the revolving credit portion of both agreements bear interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread the spread which varies depending on our credit ratings ranges from 80 to 125 basis points for our 4year agreement and 85 to 1375 basis points for our 364day agreement we also pay an annual facility fee 

  

regardless of utilization this facility fee currently 25 basis points may fluctuate between 15 and 50 basis points depending upon our credit ratings the competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis at our option 

  

these credit agreements contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth and minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios the terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to humana in the future the minimum net worth requirement was 11634 million at december 31 2002 and increases by 50 of consolidated net income each quarter the minimum interest coverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing interest expense into earnings before interest and tax expense or ebit the maximum leverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing debt into earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization expense or ebitda ebit and ebitda used to calculate compliance with these financial covenants is based upon four consecutive quarters the current minimum interest coverage ratio of 35 increases to 40 effective december 31 2003 the current maximum leverage ratio of 275 declines to 25 effective december 31 2003 at december 31 2002 our net worth of 16065 million interest coverage ratio of 137 and leverage ratio of 17 were all in compliance with the applicable requirements additionally we would have been in compliance assuming the more restrictive future financial covenant requirements were applicable at december 31 2002 

  

commercial paper programs 

  

we maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program under this program a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial paper the 265 million 364day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to 265 million the weighted average interest rate on our conduit commercial paper borrowings was 176 at december 31 2002 the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rate on the borrowings varies at market rates 

  

we also maintain and may issue shortterm debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow the program is backed by our credit agreements described above aggregate borrowing under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed 530 million 

  

other borrowings 

  

other borrowings of 55 million at december 31 2002 represent financing for the renovation of a building bear interest at 2 and are payable in various installments through 2014 

  

shelf registration 

  

on october 8 2002 we filed a universal shelf registration with the sec to register debt or equity securities from time to time up to a total of 600 million with the amount price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale once it becomes effective we will have the ability to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes including repayment or refinancing of borrowings working capital capital expenditures investments acquisitions or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 

  

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december 31 2002 as follows 

  

   

debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants we believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote we lease facilities computer hardware and other equipment under longterm operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017 we sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments an operating lease is a type of offbalance sheet arrangement assuming we acquired the asset rather than leased we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets see also note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

our 5year and 7year airplane operating leases which are included above provide for a residual value guarantee of no more than 179 million at the end of the lease terms which expire december 29 2004 for the 5year leases and january 1 2010 for the 7year lease we have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased equipment or the equipment can be sold to a third party if we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of 131 million related to the 5year leases and 48 million related to the 7year lease the amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party a 35 million gain in connection with a 1999 saleleaseback transaction is being deferred until the residual value guarantee is resolved at the end of the lease term we do not believe that we will have any payment obligation at the end of the lease because we will exercise the purchase obligation or the net proceeds from the sale of the airplanes will exceed the maximum amount payable to the lessor 

  

we have 238 million in undrawn letters of credit outstanding at december 31 2002 letters of credit totaling 109 million have been issued to ensure our payment to a beneficiary for assumed obligations of our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary related to pre1993 professional liability risks for which the beneficiary remains directly liable other letters of credit totaling 129 million were issued to ensure our payment to various beneficiaries for miscellaneous contractual obligations these letters of credit renew automatically on an annual basis unless the beneficiary otherwise notifies us in february 2003 a 50 million letter of credit supporting miscellaneous contractual obligations of ours expired without renewal over the past 10 years we have not had to fund any letters of credit 

  

through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc our parent company in the event of insolvency for 1 member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency 2 benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged and 3 payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency 

  

other liquidity factors 

  

our investment grade credit rating at december 31 2002 was baa3 according to moody’s investors services inc or moody’s and bbb according to standard  poor’s corporation or sp a downgrade to ba2 or lower by moody’s and bb or lower by sp would give the counterparty of one of our interest rate swap agreements with a 100 million notional amount the right but not the obligation to cancel the interest rate swap agreement if cancelled we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap 

  

agreement assuming this swap agreement had been cancelled on december 31 2002 we would have received 349 million other than the swap agreement adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create increase or accelerate any liabilities adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future 

  

related parties 

  

no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held may 15 2003 – see “certain transactions with management and others” 

  

regulatory requirements 

  

certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends loans or other cash transfers to humana inc our parent company require minimum levels of equity and limit investments to approved securities the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus in most states prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 

  

as of december 31 2002 we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of 10069 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated 5760 million although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume product mix and the quality of assets held minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level certain states rely on riskbased capital requirements or rbc to define the required levels of equity rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels some states are in the process of phasing in these rbc requirements over a number of years if rbc were fully implemented by all states at december 31 2002 each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have 3588 million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under rbc 

  

one tricare subsidiary under the regions 3 and 4 contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities we were in compliance with this requirement at december 31 2002 

  

future liquidity needs 

  

we believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs we also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities as well as to fund capital requirements 

  

market risksensitive financial instruments and positions 

  

the level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the shortterm duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 

  

we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelvemonth period as reflected in the following table the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelvemonth 

  

period this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income including among others unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio shifts in the asset mix between tax and taxexempt securities and spread changes specific to various investment categories in the past ten years annual changes in 3 month libor rates have exceeded 300 basis points twice have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points and have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once libor was 138 at december 31 2002 our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in libor could not exceed 138 basis points 

  

   

the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair market values of the publiclytraded equity securities we held at december 31 2002 and 2001 which are sensitive to changes in stock market values these publiclytraded equity securities are held for purposes other than trading 

  

   

annual changes in equity valuations based upon the standard  poor’s 500 stock index over the past 10 years which were in excess of 30 occurred five times between 20 and 30 occurred three times and between 10 and 20 also occurred two times 

  

government contracts 

  

our medicarechoice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a oneyear term each december 31 unless terminated 90 days prior thereto legislative proposals are being considered which may revise the medicarechoice program’s current reimbursement rates we are unable to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact they may have on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

we currently are in negotiations with the department of defense to extend our tricare contracts that expire on april 30 2003 for regions 2 and 5 and june 30 2003 for regions 3 and 4 we believe we will be able to successfully extend our tricare contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a 

  

one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new tricare next generation or tnex transition described below historical pretax profit margins for our tricare business have generally ranged from 2 to 4 percent we expect margins to continue in this range during 2003 

  

the department of defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new tnex program the department of defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract we submitted a bid in january 2003 to participate as a prime contractor for the south region additionally we partnered with aetna government health plans llc a subsidiary of aetna inc to participate as a subcontractor should aetna government health plans llc be awarded the north region an announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late 2003 with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late 2004 at this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract or the effective date of the contract 

  

if we are a successful bidder on the south region we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows although tricare profits could decline slightly tricare membership would not materially change from current levels tricare revenues and expenses would decline by approximately 20 as a result of certain benefits eg pharmacy which are included under our current contract being excluded and under separate tnex contracts in the future 

  

effective july 1 2002 we signed two contracts in puerto rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in puerto rico’s medicaid program which represents 86 of our total medicaid membership as of december 31 2002 the term of each of these contracts is three years subject to annual renewal options with the health insurance administration in puerto rico our medicaid contracts in florida and illinois generally are annual contracts 

  

the loss of any of these government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action including reductions in premium payments to us or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

legal proceedings 

  

we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business including employment matters breach of contract actions tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” of item 3 in part 1 we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters in addition recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

cautionary statements 

  

this document includes both historical and forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements are made within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 we intend such forwardlooking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events these forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions including among other things the information discussed below in making these statements we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results our business is highly complicated regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 

  

  

if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members or if our estimates of medical claim reserves are inadequate our profitability could decline 

  

we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members these costs include claims payments capitation payments allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members generally premiums in the health care business are fixed for oneyear periods accordingly costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns medical inflation historical developments including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns and other relevant factors we also record medical claims reserves for future payments we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves however increased utilization or unit cost competition government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 

  

these factors may include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives our business could be materially adversely affected 

  

our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future this strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business introduction of new products and benefit designs the successful implementation of our ebusiness initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies we believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

  

if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively our membership and profitability could decline 

  

we are in a highly competitive industry many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets in addition other companies may enter our markets in the future contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually while health plans compete on the basis of many factors including service and the quality and depth of provider networks we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 

  

premium increases introduction of new product designs and our relationship with our providers in various markets among others could affect our membership levels other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of medicarechoice service and the exit of commercial products in some markets if we do not compete effectively in our markets if membership does not increase as we expect or if it declines or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

  

if we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully our financial results could suffer 

  

in general prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years these increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brandname drugs and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes in order to control prescription drug costs we have implemented multitiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs including our fourtiered copayment benefit design rx4 we are also evaluating other multitiered designs we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are involved in various legal actions which if resolved unfavorably to us could result in substantial monetary damages 

  

we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business including employment and employment discriminationrelated suits employee benefit claims breach of contract actions tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud 

  

we and some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits these include separate suits against us and five of our competitors that purport to be brought on behalf of members of managed care plans which we refer to as the subscriber track cases in addition there is a single action against us and eight of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers which we refer to as the provider track case these suits allege breaches of federal statutes including erisa and rico 

  

in addition because of the nature of the health care business we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including the design management and offering of products and services these include and could include in the future 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

in some cases substantial noneconomic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act rico and other statutes may be sought while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 

  

in addition some types of damages like punitive damages may not be covered by insurance particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 

  

a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “legal proceedings” of item 3 in part i we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters in addition recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims therefore these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

as a government contractor we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 

  

a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal state and local government health care coverage programs including the medicarechoice medicaid and tricare programs these programs involve various risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 

  

the managed care industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation including some large jury awards legislative activity regulation and governmental review of industry practices these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services may require us to change our products or services may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation which along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 

  

the health care industry in general and health management organizations or hmos and preferred provider organizations or ppos in particular are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

state regulations require our licensed operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities additionally those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments loans loan repayments or other payments to us 

  

in recent years significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to 

  

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

all of these proposals could apply to us 

  

there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 

  

the national association of insurance commissioners or naic has adopted riskbased capital requirements also known as rbc which is subject to statebystate adoption and to the extent implemented sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and hmo companies the naic recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for hmos has been adopted in most states in which we operate the hmo rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries 

  

the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions establishing uniform health care provider payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions the compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to october 17 2003 based on our submission of a compliance plan including work plan and implementation strategy to the secretary of health and human services under the new hipaa privacy rules by april 14 2003 we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed regulations issued in february 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april 21 2005 violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements training and administrative effort the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 

  

another area receiving increased focus in 2002 is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days however due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards procedures and penalties we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices the providersponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our company to additional liability and penalties 

  

  

on november 21 2000 the department of labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under erisa the claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by erisa whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are selffunded as a result the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and unionsponsored health and disability plans except church and government plans similar to legislation recently passed by many states the new erisa claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals according to the department of labor however its erisa claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new erisa regulation impossible unlike its state counterparts the erisa claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions instead the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid statemandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court the new erisa claims and appeals rules generally became effective july 1 2002 or the first day of the first plan year beginning after july 1 2002 whichever is later in any case health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after january 1 2003 

  

we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations these can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms the office of the inspector general of health and human services the office of personnel management the department of justice and state departments of insurance and departments of health these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs or the imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions in addition disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 

  

if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members our business could be adversely affected 

  

we contract with physicians hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a costeffective manner 

  

in any particular market providers could refuse to contract with us demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements in some markets some providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions and negotiating power in addition physician or practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage may in some cases compete directly with us if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 

  

we currently are in negotiations with hca inc regarding our contracts in florida covering 30 hospitals which expire on april 30 2003 although we have included estimated hospital rate increases in our commercial premium rates and in our medicare benefit designs we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these negotiations but believe such outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in some situations we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined fixed permemberpermonth fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members ie capitation the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship 

  

with us in addition payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 

  

our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 

  

because we operate as a holding company we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc the parent company these subsidiaries generally are regulated by state departments of insurance in most states we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts or in some states any amount we are also required by law to maintain specific proscribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries one tricare subsidiary under the regions 3 and 4 contract with the department of defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities in addition we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval

item 14 controls and procedures 

  

within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer or ceo and chief financial officer or cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures including our internal controls 

  

the company’s management including the ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures including our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  

based on this evaluation our ceo and cfo concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures including our internal controls are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic sec reports there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date we carried out our evaluation
