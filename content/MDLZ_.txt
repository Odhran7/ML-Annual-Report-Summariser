competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies including new startup brands and businesses some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore may approach pricing and promotional decisions differently we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience nutritional value the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of digital and other sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price growing our market share or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures we believe these investments lead to better products and stronger brands for the consumer and support our growth and market position 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can sustainably and costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production 

a number of external factors such as changing weather patterns and conditions commodity market conditions effects from the current covid19 global pandemic supply chain disruptions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

due to factors noted above the costs of our principal raw materials can fluctuate during late 2021 in particular commodity costs have primarily increased due to recent supply chain disruptions we expect commodity cost volatility to continue and our commodity hedging activities cannot fully offset this volatility despite the recent and expected supply chain transportation and labor disruptions at this time we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available however we continue to monitor the nearterm and longterm impacts of the pandemic supply chain disruptions climate change and related factors that could affect the availability or cost of raw materials packaging and energy for additional information

sustainability and mindful snacking 

our mission is to lead the future of snacking by creating snacks the right way for both people and planet we are focused on making our snacks more sustainably by using ingredients consumers know and trust using less energy and water and creating less waste our mindful snacking strategy aims to encourage consumers to snack with moderation through portion control offerings and portion size labeling and we continue to evolve our portfolio to meet consumers’ needs we have specific goals and continue to make progress and scale our efforts to deliver meaningful change by living our purpose to empower people to snack right we believe we can continue to have a positive impact on the lives of our consumers and the world around us 

we have been focused on sustainability for many years and are committed to making a meaningful difference including in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in our endtoend assessment of our supply chain from suppliers to consumers raw ingredient sourcing including primarily cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils and related land use is the predominant contributor to our scope 1 through 3 estimated greenhouse gas emissions we have been continuing to work to reduce emissions and in november 2021 we announced our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain including scope 1 through 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 

“net zero emissions” refers to achieving a balance between greenhouse gas emissions released through human activities and those removed from the atmosphere getting to net zero emissions means we plan to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with sbti mitigation pathways using lowcarbon technologies and agricultural practices in line with the sbti net zero protocol we would then neutralize the impact of any residual emissions that cannot be eliminated by permanently removing an equivalent amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide such as through certified greenhouse gas emission reduction projects and sequestration to date we have not focused on using carbon credits or similar instruments and our priority is to continue to reduce our emissions in line with the sbti protocol our strategies could change over time through 2050 as new emission reduction options become available 

as we work to accomplish these goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain we are focused on helping to expand the use of regenerative agricultural methods preserve forested protected lands conserve resources such as water and energy and foster safe and equitable workplaces and communities we continue to expand our raw material sourcing programs such as cocoa life for cocoa and harmony for wheat and leverage our supplier relationships and industrysector coalitions to promote the use of new agricultural methods and technologies and tools focused on improving yields and reducing related greenhouse gas emissions within our operations we plan to increase our use of lowcarbon technology to reduce emissions and increase our use of renewable energy we also plan to invest in lowcarbon solutions as we replace ovens and refrigerants and increase our use of recycled plastic and other types of packaging materials 

in addition to our 2050 net zero greenhouse gas emissions goal our 2025 sustainability and mindful snacking goals include 

• reducing food waste in manufacturing endtoend co 2e emissions and priority water usage 

• designing all packaging to be recyclable 

• scaling our cocoa life sustainability program so that cocoa life will produce 100 of the cocoa volume we require for our chocolate brands 

• growing portion control products to 20 of snacks net revenues 

• including mindful snacking portion information on all packages globally by 2025 

in september 2021 we issued our first green bonds raising nearly €20 billion or approximately 24 billion further enabling us to costeffectively fund eligible projects that align with our sustainability priorities in the areas of building a thriving ingredient supply chain and reducing our environmental impact

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business operating results liquidity and financial condition while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business performance or financial condition in the future 

strategic and operational risks 

global or regional health pandemics or epidemics including covid19 could negatively impact our business operations financial performance and results of operations 

our business and financial results could be negatively impacted by covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic remain uncertain and hard to predict since 2020 covid19 has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and it could negatively impact our business in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• in 2020 the covid19 pandemic resulted in lower revenues in some of our emerging market countries that have a greater concentration of traditional trade outlets such as small familyrun stores as well as in our world travel retail such as international dutyfree stores and foodservice businesses and categories like gum and candy which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home some of these parts of our business continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic and some of these areas such as gum that grew in 2021 have not fully recovered to prepandemic levels we are unable to predict how long these trends will continue or whether they will worsen 

• in 2020 and 2021 sales of some of our products in some markets and channels increased such as products for inhome consumption and categories like biscuits as well as the modern trade and digital commerce channels we are unable to predict how long this sustained demand will last different markets and parts of our business will recover from the covid19 pandemic at different rates depending on many factors including vaccination levels or new covid19 variants and related outbreaks within a market 

• the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and could materially disrupt our global supply chain operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers their suppliers our external manufacturing partners distributors or other business partners disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them have increased and could in the future increase product or distribution costs or cause delays in delivering or an inability to deliver products to our customers for example we experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging markets such as india and nigeria in the first half of 2020 and vietnam in 2021 

• the covid19 pandemic has resulted in broader supply transportation and labor disruptions resulting in inflation and generally higher operating costs in our business in 2021 we experienced labor disruptions primarily in our north america region which impacted our sales in the fourth quarter we also experienced laborrelated disruptions in our network of thirdparty logistics and external manufacturing and we anticipate labor shortagerelated issues will continue in 2022 as a result of incremental pandemicrelated expenditures and labor disruptions we incurred and expect to continue to incur higher labor costs particularly as the pandemic continues 

table of contents 

• commodity and transportation costs have become more volatile and generally increased due to the covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions and transportation and labor shortages we expect commodity cost volatility to continue and our commodity hedging activities cannot fully offset this volatility 

• further disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic could result in delays or modifications to our strategic plans and initiatives 

• illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions have affected and could materially negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes the pandemic has also necessitated increased expenditures to secure the safety and effectiveness of our personnel and operations 

• government or regulatory responses to pandemics could negatively impact our business mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in some countries temporarily disrupted our ability to distribute our products in some markets resumption continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially adversely impact our operations and results 

• initially during the covid19 pandemic the us dollar appreciated materially against other currencies in the countries in which we operate resulting in currency translation losses if the us dollar were to appreciate again against some or all of those same currencies the resulting currency translation losses along with currency transaction losses could adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition 

• the covid19 outbreak initially increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and commercial paper markets and volatility may increase again as covid19 evolves we might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like or on terms we find acceptable and our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts 

these and other impacts of the covid19 or other global or regional health pandemics or epidemics could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors below including but not limited to those relating to our reputation brands consumer preferences supply chain product sales results of operations or financial condition we might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results the ultimate impact of these disruptions also depends on events beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of the covid19 and other pandemics or epidemics and actions taken by parties other than us to respond to them and in the case of covid19 on the emergence and spread of covid19 variants including omicron any of these disruptions could have a negative impact on our business operations financial performance results of operations and stock price and this impact could be material additionally covid19 may also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we face risks related to the execution of our strategy and our timely response to channel shifts and pricing and other competitive pressures 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include food snack and beverage companies that operate in multiple geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies failure to effectively respond to challenges from our competitors could adversely affect our business 

competitor and customer pressures require that we timely and effectively respond to changes in distribution channels and technological developments that may require changes in our prices these pressures could affect our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively and timely assess new or developing trends technological advancements or changes in distribution methods and set proper pricing including as a result of inflation or effective trade incentives could negatively impact demand for our products our operating results achievement of our strategic and financial goals and our ability to capitalize on new revenue or valueproducing opportunities the rapid growth of some channels such as discounters as well as digital commerce which has expanded significantly following the onset of the covid19 pandemic may impact our current operations or strategies more quickly than we planned for create consumer price deflation alter the buying behavior of consumers or disrupt our retail customer relationships we may need to increase or reallocate spending on existing and new distribution channels and technologies marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase revenues market share and brand significance these expenditures may not be successful including those related to our digital commerce and other technologyfocused efforts and might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial

condition results of operations and cash flows we will be disadvantaged if we are not able to effectively leverage developing channels such as directtoconsumer and electronic businesstobusiness commerce new distribution channels as well as growing opportunities to utilize external manufacturers lower barriers to entry and allow smaller competitors to more effectively gain market share additionally if we adjust pricing but cannot maintain or increase sales volumes or our labor or other costs increase but we cannot increase prices to offset those changes our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

during 2021 we continued to operate under our strategy which focuses on accelerating consumercentric and volumedriven growth operational excellence driven by cost discipline simplification and continuous operational improvement including in areas like sales execution and building a winning growth culture with a “local first” commercial approach we have developed an approach to esg that we believe supports our strategy and is focused on four areas safety supply security our environmental footprint and consumer wellbeing if our strategy is not effective we fail to achieve our goals and objectives or identify or prioritize the areas most important to achieving our goals or we fail to effectively operate under our strategy in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

promoting and protecting our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands expand to new geographies and new distribution platforms such as digital commerce and evolve our portfolio with new product offerings that meet consumer needs and expectations 

we seek to strengthen our brands through investments in our product quality product renovation innovation and marketing investments including consumerrelevant advertising digital transformation and consumer promotions failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on wellbeing including changing consumer acceptance of certain ingredients industrial manufacturing and processing nutritional expectations of our products and the sustainability of our ingredients our supply chain and our packaging including plastic packaging and its ability to be recycled and other environmental impacts could adversely affect our brands increased negative attention from the media academics and online influencers governments shareholders and other stakeholders in these areas as well as on the role of food marketing and other environmental social human capital or governance practices could adversely affect our brand image undue caution or our failure to react timely in addressing these challenges and trends could weaken our competitive position such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations industry selfregulation that is unevenly adopted among companies and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increasing and disparate legal or regulatory restrictions on our labeling advertising and consumer promotions or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands this includes regulations such as frontofpack labeling selective food taxes and agebased restrictions on sales of products with certain nutritional profiles enacted in some states in mexico in the united kingdom a ban on specific types of tv and online advertising of food containing levels of fat sugar or salt above specified thresholds is expected to go into effect in 2023 and new measures restricting certain promotions and instore placement of some of those products are expected to go into effect in october 2022 moreover adverse publicity regulatory developments or legal action against us our employees or our licensees related to product quality and safety where and how we manufacture our products environmental risks including climate change human and workplace rights across our supply chain labor relations or antitrust antibribery and anticorruption compliance could damage our reputation and brand health such actions could undermine our customers’ and shareholders’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations our product sponsorship relationships including those with celebrity spokespersons influencers or group affiliations could also subject us to negative publicity 

in addition our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on established and emerging social media and online platforms digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns targeted marketing and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions as well as our own policies and participation in industry selfregulation initiatives limit how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our brand renovation innovation marketing and promotion plans particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve we might also fail to sufficiently evolve our digital marketing efforts to effectively utilize consumer data negative posts or comments about mondelēz international our brands or our employees on social media or web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media accounts and failure to respond 

table of contents 

effectively to these posts comments or activities could damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate our brands may be associated with or appear alongside harmful content before these platforms or our own social media monitoring can detect this risk to our brand in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brands our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results and we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks when consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future which could harm our brand image and sales third parties might also improperly use our brands as part of phishing or other scams which could negatively affect our brand image failure to successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health could materially and adversely affect our company and product brands as well as our product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

we must correctly predict identify interpret and meet changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new and improved products that meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify interpret and meet the tastes dietary habits packaging sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences in the places and ways consumers want to shop there may be further shifts in the relative size of shopping channels in addition to the increasing role of digital commerce for consumers our success relies upon managing this complexity to promote and bring our products to consumers effectively moreover weak economic conditions inflation equity market volatility or other factors such as global or local pandemics and severe or unusual weather events affect consumer preferences and demand we have experienced continued evolution of lifestyles and consumption patterns including increased demand for biscuits and decreased demand for gum in connection with the covid19 pandemic failure to offer and deliver products that appeal to consumers or to correctly judge consumer demand for our products will impact our ability to meet our growth targets and our sales and market share could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads and trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences our sales can be adversely affected when we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences or category trends will be longterm or we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy changing preferences in addition because of our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must be responsive to local consumer needs including with respect to when and how consumers snack and their desire for premium or value offerings we must also provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences and use marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories or reach consumers in efficient and effective ways leveraging data and analytics 

negative perceptions concerning the health environmental and social implications of certain food products ingredients packaging materials and sourcing or production methods could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers have increasingly focused on wellbeing including reducing sodium and added sugar consumption as well as the source and authenticity of ingredients in the foods they consume continuing to expand our wellbeing offerings and refining the ingredient and nutrition profiles of existing products is important to our growth as is maintaining focus on ethical sourcing and supply chain management opportunities to address evolving consumer preferences in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and other activities to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions or failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 751 of our 2021 net revenues 732 of our 2020 net revenues and 744 of our 2019 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries therefore we are subject to risks inherent in global operations those risks include 

table of contents 

• compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states including antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” 

• the imposition of increased or new tariffs sanctions quotas trade barriers price floors or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities like cocoa potential changes in us trade programs and trade relations with other countries or regulations taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales or profitability 

• compliance with antitrust and competition laws trade laws data privacy laws antibribery laws human rights laws and a variety of other local national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes 

• currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values including in developing markets such as argentina brazil china india mexico russia ukraine türkiye egypt nigeria south africa and pakistan as well as in developed markets such as the united kingdom and countries within the european union this includes events like applying highly inflationary accounting as we did for our argentinean subsidiaries beginning in july 2018 

• changes in capital controls including currency exchange controls government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished products into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the united states 

• increased sovereign risk such as defaults by or deterioration in the economies and credit ratings of governments particularly in our latin america and amea regions 

• changes or inconsistencies in local regulations and laws the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in nonus jurisdictions and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources 

• varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights 

• discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies 

• greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles and 

• design implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war government shutdowns travel or immigration restrictions tariffs and other trade restrictions public health risks or pandemics including covid19 energy policy or restrictions public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties including inaccuracies in our assumptions about these factors could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand high unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the separation of the united kingdom’s from the european union “brexit” could have a negative effect on our business see below and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial outlook – brexit for more information the nature and degree of the various risks we face can also differ significantly among our regions and businesses 

all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows stock price and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or long term 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including among others brazil china india mexico russia argentina eastern europe the middle east africa and southeast asia however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries particularly those with emerging economies engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws may be more common these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations and stock price 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and lowcost local manufacturers improve and expand their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy failure to successfully increase our business in emerging markets and

our use of information technology and thirdparty service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions 

we use information technology and thirdparty service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations such as manufacturing and distribution communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls executing mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing number of services important to conducting our business including accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware including the june 2017 malware incident that affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks the “2017 malware incident” other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security power outages hardware or software failures denial of service attacks telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences our use of new and emerging technologies such as cloudbased services and mobile applications continues to evolve presenting new and additional risks in managing access to our data relying on third parties to manage and safeguard data ensuring access to our systems and availability of thirdparty systems in addition we are experiencing new and more frequent attempts by third parties to gain access to our systems such as through increased email phishing of our workforce 

cybersecurity breaches of our or thirdparty systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks such as hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached these risks could be magnified given the increased number of employees contractors and others working outside of offices during the covid19 pandemic when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various thirdparty service providers and for thirdparty service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might increase challenges and costs to resolve related issues additionally new initiatives such as those related to digital commerce and direct sales that increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain increase our potential exposure to a cybersecurity breach if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our thirdparty providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition results of operations and stock price may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data such as advanced email protection to reduce the likelihood of credential thefts and electronic fraud attempts we also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on the updated threat however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis due to the constantly evolving and complex nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly 

we transfer data across local regional and national borders to conduct our operations and we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 and has greatly increased the

jurisdictional reach of eu law added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance of up to 4 of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year in addition to potential restrictions on data transfer and processing the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective in january 2020 requires greater transparency in handling personal information from consumers by imposing new responsibilities for the handling disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers the ccpa permits california to assess potentially significant fines for violating ccpa and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations regulations to implement the ccpa were finalized in august 2020 in addition new privacy regulations such as the california privacy rights act which grants a private right of action to individuals the virginia consumer data protection act and the colorado privacy act will enter into effect in 2023 our efforts to comply with multijurisdictional privacy and data protection laws and the uncertainty of new laws and regulations will likely increase the complexity of our processes and may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

we are subject to risks from unanticipated business disruptions 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we utilize an interdependent supply chain – a complex network of suppliers and material needs owned and leased manufacturing locations external manufacturing partners distribution networks shared service delivery centers and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters water and energy availability supply and commodity shortages terrorism political unrest cybersecurity incidents labor shortages strikes operational andor financial instability of our key suppliers and other vendors or service providers government shutdowns or health pandemics such as covid19 including any potential impact of climate change on these factors could damage or disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers their suppliers our external manufacturing partners distributors or other business partners failure to effectively prepare for and respond to disruptions in our operations for example by not finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations or by not quickly repairing damage to our information production or supply systems can cause delays in delivering or the inability to deliver products to our customers as we experienced in connection with the 2017 malware incident and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected moreover disputes with significant customers or suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our sales financial condition and results of operations the occurrence of a material or extended disruption may cause us to lose our customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline some risks are difficult or impossible to insure through the insurance programs we use to transfer many of these risks and the timing of insurance recoveries may not match the timing of our financial loss we are subject to risk related to operational safety including risk of fire explosion or accidental contamination we could also fail to achieve our strategic objectives due to capability or technology deficiencies related to our ongoing reconfiguration of our supply chain to drive efficiencies and fuel growth further our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity significant changes in trade policies changes in volume produced and changes to regulatory restrictions or laborrelated or other constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa wheat palm oil soy dairy other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of product packaging materials natural gas fuel and electricity for our factories and warehouses and we also incur expenses in connection with labor and the transportation and delivery of our products costs of raw materials energy and other supplies and services are volatile and fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations geopolitical conditions or conflicts tariffs or other trade barriers government intervention to introduce living income premiums or similar requirements such as those announced in 2019 in two of the main cocoagrowing countries changes in environmental or trade policy and regulations alternative energy and agricultural programs severe weather agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics including covid19 forest fires and consumer or industrial demand many of these conditions are or could be exacerbated or worsened by climate change increased government intervention and consumer or activist responses caused by increased focus on climate change

deforestation water plastic waste animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions our work to monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases cannot fully protect us from changes in commodity costs due to factors like market illiquidity specific local regulations and downstream costs thus our hedging strategies have not always protected and will not in the future always protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products including increases to cover inflation and higher input packaging and transportation costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services like transportation such as we experienced across our business particularly in the united states and united kingdom primarily in the second half of 2021 may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices if increased prices affect demand for our products or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price can be materially adversely affected 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives and acquisitions and joint ventures are an important part of our strategy to increase our exposure to fastgrowing snacking segments fill geographic white spaces and expand into adjacent categories we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners in addition execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate as appropriate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws equity investments such as our investments in jde peet’s nv and keurig dr pepper inc joint ventures and other strategic alliances pose additional risks as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time who may not have the same priorities strategies or resources as we do or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and nonfinancial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits depending on the nature of the business ventures including whether they operate globally these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are including political economic regulatory and compliance risks currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility of commodity and other input prices either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected 

furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability

macroeconomic and industry risks 

climate change might adversely impact our supply chain or our operations 

scientific evidence collected by the intergovernmental panel on climate change demonstrates that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe that expose us to physical and transition risk physical risks include increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters and effects on water availability and quality these impacts increase risks to the global food production and distribution system decreased agricultural productivity caused by climate change might limit the availability of the commodities we purchase and use these include cocoa which is a critical raw material for our chocolate and biscuit portfolios that is particularly sensitive to changes in climate as well as other raw materials such as dairy wheat vegetable oils sugar and nuts weather events such as floods severe storms or water shortages that are partially caused or exacerbated by climate change might disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers their suppliers our external manufacturing partners distributors or other business partners 

transition risks include increased focus by federal state and local regulatory and legislative bodies globally regarding environmental policies relating to climate change regulating greenhouse gas emissions energy policies and sustainability including single use plastics new legal and regulatory requirements have increased and could continue to increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging through taxes or regulations including payments under extended producer responsibility policies taxes on specific packaging material types and targets to increase the use of reuserefill delivery models increasing regulation of carbon taxes could also substantially increase our product supply chain and distribution costs concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact and towards products that are more sustainably grown and made and we expect to incur additional costs as we evolve our portfolio and engage in due diligence verification and reporting in connection with our esg and sustainability initiatives we might not effectively address increased attention from the media shareholders activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters including deforestation land use water use and packaging including plastic those stakeholders might also have requests or proposals that are not aligned with the focus of our efforts on climate change and esg matters climate changerelated impacts could also reduce demand for our products if costs for raw materials increase or availability decreases we raise prices for our products and our competitors respond differently to those cost or availability pressures demand for our products and our market share could suffer we have also experienced decreased demand for chocolate during periods when temperatures are warmer 

in 2021 we announced our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 achieving this goal will require significant transformation of our business capital investment and the development of technology that might not currently exist we might incur significant additional expense or be required to recognize impairment charges in connection with our efforts and we might be unable to achieve our goal 

any or all of these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet the needs of our customers reputation product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets discounters digital commerce merchants warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and other major markets continue to consolidate form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market resulting in fewer larger customers large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or longer payment terms retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels and has increased further in response to the covid19 pandemic the growth of alternative online retail channels such as directtoconsumer and electronic businesstobusiness may adversely affect our relationships with our large retail and wholesale customers 

table of contents 

in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as that caused by the covid19 pandemic consumers may not buy our products if they perceive little difference between the quality or value of our products and those of retailer or other economy brands if consumers prefer or otherwise choose to purchase the retailer or other economy brands we can lose market share or sales volumes or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

failure to effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

we are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers suppliers and distributors 

during 2021 our five largest customers accounted for 167 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to a significant customer could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to the customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

disputes with significant customers suppliers or distributors including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply or deliver products or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations the financial condition of our significant customers and business partners are affected by events that are largely beyond our control such as the covid19 pandemic new regulations can also affect our commercial practices and our relationship with customers suppliers or distributors deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers suppliers or distributors or regulations affecting our relationship with these parties could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce and respond to shifts in labor availability 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel with a variety of capabilities in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies we could experience unplanned or increased turnover of employees with key capabilities or fail to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business we could also fail to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities that we need to continue to respond to changing consumer and customer needs and grow our business including skills in the areas of digital commerce and marketing data analytics and procurement and supply chain expertise occurrence of any of these conditions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness 

we are experiencing an increasingly tight and competitive labor market and could face unforeseen challenges in the availability of labor such as we have experienced since the outbreak of covid19 a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base caused by covid19 or related issues such as vaccine mandates or as a result of general macroeconomic factors have led and in the future could lead to increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wages to attract and retain employees we have also been negatively affected and could continue to be negatively affected by labor shortages or constraints experienced by our partners including our external manufacturing partners and freight providers failure to achieve and maintain a diverse workforce and leadership team compensate our employees competitively and fairly maintain a safe and inclusive environment or promote the wellbeing of our employees could affect our reputation and also result in lower performance and an inability to retain valuable employees 

table of contents 

we must address changes in and that affect our workforce and satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 61 of our 68000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 11000 us employees strikes such as the one we experienced in some of our us manufacturing and distribution facilities in 2021 work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers distributors or other business partners or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements have in the past and may in the future cause disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing or distribution processes changes in immigration laws and policies or restrictions such as those imposed in connection with the covid19 pandemic could make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees we could also fail to effectively respond to evolving perceptions and goals of those in our workforce or whom we might seek to hire including in response to changes brought on by the covid19 pandemic with respect to flexible working or other matters 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business and meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

legal and regulatory risks 

we face risks related to complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate 

our activities around the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production packaging and waste management storage distribution sales advertising labeling and marketing as well as intellectual property competition antitrust trade labor tax and environmental matters privacy data protection and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations as well as their interpretations of existing laws and regulations our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or to make changes necessary to comply with new or revised laws and regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows for instance our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in the corporate tax policies of the united states and other countries trade relations among the united states and other countries including china mexico and the european union and changes within the european union such as brexit evolving expectations on esg disclosures and reporting will also result in new regulatory actions at a corporate and brand level 

following brexit in 2020 a new trade arrangement was reached between the uk and eu that began on january 1 2021 we have experienced disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the uk inflationary cost pressures increased in our uk business in 2021 as we also experienced in other markets if the uk’s separation from or new trade arrangements with the eu negatively impact the uk economy or result in disagreements on trade terms delays affecting our supply chain or distribution disruptions to sales or collections or further increases in inflationary cost pressures the impact to our results of operations financial condition cash flows and stock price could be material see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial outlook – brexit for more information 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed deliberate or unintentional product contamination including contamination of ingredients we use in our products that third parties supply spoilage or other adulteration product mislabeling or product tampering these risks could be heightened in light of increased pressure on our suppliers from the covid19 pandemic and supply chain challenges onsite quality audits of third parties such as suppliers external manufacturers and trademark licensees have been limited in some instances by travel restrictions and heightened safety protocols in light of covid19 and remote audits do not fully offset risks from the inability to conduct onsite audits in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

table of contents 

we may also suffer losses when our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations or when our or our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability claim or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales product inventory financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price and we could incur significant expense responding to such a claim 

we face risks related to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we operate around the world in many regulated environments with constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks and we are subject to risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions actions by our employees contractors or agents in violation of our policies and procedures could lead to deficiencies in our internal or other controls or violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations furthermore as a result of the covid19 pandemic and supply chain challenges there may be investigations legal claims or litigation against us relating to our actions or decisions in response to these conditions we could also be subject to litigation legal claims or regulatory actions in connection with the continued evolution of our sustainability and esgrelated initiatives when litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arise out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price even if a claim is unsuccessful without merit or not pursued to completion the cost of responding to such a claim including expenses and management time could adversely affect us 

we could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement disclosure and other controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements and other disclosures including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file financial reports or make other disclosures accurately and on a timely basis 

we face challenges as we work to meet our esg goals and continue to evolve our esgrelated disclosures and reporting considering various existing and developing standards such as those of the financial stability board’s tcfd the eu corporate sustainability reporting directive and the sasb standards of the value reporting foundation we might fail to meet our esg goals or report on them accurately and timely 

as a result of any of these factors our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to adequately protecting our valuable intellectual property rights 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets recipes technology knowhow and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses and infringement of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business financial condition and stock price 

table of contents 

we may be unaware of potential thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products which could include removal of existing products from sale any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation brand health ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price 

financial risks 

we face risks related to tax matters including changes in tax laws and rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes 

in december 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation “us tax reform” and we have factored the original legislation as well as additional guidance issued through 2021 into our financial results of operations as applicable during november 2021 the us house of representatives passed a bill that contains significant changes to current rules but the senate has not yet acted on it adoption of new us tax rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

tax legislation enacted by foreign jurisdictions could significantly affect our ongoing operations including rate changes as well as additional corporate tax provisions that could disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting payments or subject us to new types of tax during december 2021 the organization of economic cooperation and development “oecd” released model rules for a global minimum tax which could have a material adverse effect on us if enacted also see note 16 income taxes  for details of the 2019 enacted swiss tax law changes finally aspects of us tax laws may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision additionally changes in tax laws in the us or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax provision results of operations cash flows and stock price 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2021 we sold our products in over 150 countries and had operations in approximately 80 countries consequently a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial position and operating results are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders in addition movements in currency exchange rates affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries our efforts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions may not be successful we hedge a number of risks including exposures to foreign exchange rate movements and volatility of interest rates that could impact our future borrowing costs hedging of these risks could potentially subject us to counterparty credit risk in addition local economies monetary policies and currency hedging availability affect our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses we might not be able to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency risks due to factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty inflation and limited hedging opportunities accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect future demand for our products our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or longterm

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings rising interest rates illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets or the effectiveness of our cash management programs reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our shortand longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry could affect our access to and the availability and cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future globally central banks have indicated they are likely to change monetary policies over the next one to two years including increasing interest rates there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

we use cash management programs such as factoring and supply chain finance arrangements in our business when circumstances are favorable to manage liquidity if these programs or underlying customer or supplier terms do not continue and we are unable to secure alternative programs our cash and working capital may be negatively affected and we may have to utilize our various financing arrangements or increase our longterm borrowings for short and longterm liquidity requirements 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and stock price 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates our participation in multiemployer pension plans and other factors could increase our costs relating to our employees’ pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for a number of our employees throughout the world and also contribute to other employees’ pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor at the end of 2021 the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was 126 billion and plan assets were 128 billion 

for defined benefit pension plans that we maintain the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate and government debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market value of plan assets affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and impact our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we will be required to make additional cash contributions to these companysponsored pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost 

we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain us unionrepresented employees as a participating employer under multiemployer pension plans we may owe more than the contributions we are required to make under the applicable collective bargaining agreements for example if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability such as the withdrawal liability we are paying in connection with our complete withdrawal from the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund in 2018 this kind of withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates see note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price

recent developments and significant items affecting comparability 

covid19 

as the covid19 global pandemic continues and new variants of the virus emerge such as omicron in late 2021 our main priorities continue to be the safety of our employees and helping maintain the global food supply together with our employees customers suppliers and other partners we are working to emerge from the pandemic stronger 

during 2020 the first year of the pandemic we experienced a significant increase in demand and revenue growth in certain markets as consumers increased their food purchases for inhome consumption results were particularly strong in modern trade such as large grocery supermarkets and retail chains digital commerce and especially for categories such as biscuits however other parts of our business were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and other related restrictions this was especially so during the second quarter of 2020 for some of our emerging markets due to store closures particularly in our latin america region as well as parts of our amea region that have a greater concentration of traditional trade such as small familyrun stores our world travel retail such as international dutyfree stores and our foodservice businesses as well as categories like gum and candy which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home the negative impacts experienced in the second quarter of 2020 began to subside in the second half of 2020 as demand grew in both developed and emerging markets and a number of our key markets returned to higher growth however our gum and candy world travel retail and foodservice businesses as well as parts of our traditional trade business in parts of emerging markets continued to be negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic 

during 2021 we continued to see increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020 however revenue from parts of our business were not yet back to prepandemic levels in 2021 net revenue growth was 80 and organic net revenue growth was 52 in 2021 while we experienced doubledigit revenue growth in gum as well as significant growth in other areas such as foodservice and world travel retail revenues in these businesses were not fully recovered to prepandemic levels our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong but as the pandemic continues we anticipate increased volatility in revenues until covidrelated risks and the international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints subside and snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level 

we continue to track new developments and ongoing impacts from the pandemic most disruptions we experienced in our operations due to the pandemic have been temporary and not material to our consolidated results in the second half of 2021 we experienced higher operating costs including higher overall raw material transportation labor and fuel costs that we anticipate will continue into 2022 we discuss these and other ongoing impacts of covid19 below 

table of contents 

our employees customers and communities 

we have taken a number of actions to promote the health and safety of our employees customers and consumers which is our first priority 

• we implemented enhanced protocols to provide a safe and sanitary working environment for our employees in many locations our employees are working remotely whenever possible for employees who were unable to work remotely we adopted a number of heightened protocols consistent with those prescribed by the world health organization related to social distancing including staggering lunchtimes and shifts where possible and restricting inperson gatherings and nonessential travel and enhanced hygiene and workplace sanitation we have worked with governments and healthcare providers to help provide access to vaccines for our frontline and office employees when and where possible at a local level at a local level we have also provided additional flexibility and support to employees in our manufacturing facilities distribution and logistics operations and sales organization as more employees who have been working remotely return to shared workplaces we have enhanced safety protocols we will follow while also encouraging continued flexible and virtual work arrangements wherever possible 

• we have hired frontline employees in the us and other locations to meet additional marketplace demand and promote uninterrupted functioning of our manufacturing distribution and sales network labor markets particularly in the us uk as well as in other countries have significantly tightened we recognize the demand for talent and continue to actively work to safeguard engage attract and retain our employees 

• since the start of the pandemic we have donated over 30 million to assist those impacted by covid19 and to support local and global organizations responding to food instability and providing emergency relief 

our supply chain and operations 

we operate in the food and beverages industry and are part of the global food supply chain one of our main objectives during the pandemic is to maintain the availability of our products to meet the needs of our consumers in response to increased demand we increased production and until recently we have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain or operations beginning in the second half of 2021 we began to experience more significant supply chain disruptions and higher operating costs as noted below 

• as global supply transportation and labor disruptions escalated in the second half of 2021 particularly in the us and uk we incurred higher operating costs in our business 

• we also experienced labor disruptions primarily in our north america region in the third quarter of 2021 including a strike that affected six of our us manufacturing and sales distribution facilities for several weeks in september 2021 after working with our employees and union representatives to resolve the strike we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement at these facilities in the fourth quarter of 2021 we did not experience significant operating or labor disruptions however we anticipate some disruption in early 2022 and higher expected absenteeism due to illness within our operations and among our thirdparty suppliers and business partners primarily as a result of the omicron variant throughout the second half of 2021 we also experienced laborrelated disruptions in our network of thirdparty logistics and external manufacturing and we anticipate labor shortagerelated issues will continue into 2022 as a result of incremental pandemicrelated expenditures and labor disruptions we incurred and expect to incur higher labor costs particularly as the pandemic continues 

• we continue to source raw ingredients packaging energy and transportation and deliver our products to our customers costs for resources particularly commodity and transportation costs have continued to increase external factors including the pandemic adverse weather conditions supply chain disruptions and transportation and labor shortages have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our operating costs although we monitor these costs and our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against all cost increases and changes in costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials or other costs we also may not be able to adjust pricing timely or fully and this may negatively affect our revenue margins or earnings we anticipate some of the supply transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends we experienced in 2021 will continue in 2022 while we have not had significant delays or unavailability of raw ingredients or other supplies we continue to monitor this risk at this time we believe we will be able to continue to source raw materials and other supplies we use in our business 

• the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related economic effects may disrupt our global supply chain operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers their suppliers our comanufacturers distributors or other business partners these disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs and prices and continue to negatively affect operations and results 

• during the pandemic we have incurred higher operating costs primarily for labor customer service and logistics security personal protective equipment and cleaning while we have not had longterm severe supply chain disruptions we do not know whether or how our supply chain or operations may be negatively 

table of contents 

affected if the pandemic continues we intend to continue to execute on our strategic operating plans as the situation evolves disruptions higher operating costs or uncertainties like those noted above could result in delays or modifications to our plans and initiatives 

our liquidity 

we believe the steps we have taken to enhance our capital structure and liquidity prior to and during the pandemic strengthened our ability to operate during the pandemic 

• in 2021 we generated 41 billion of cash from operations or approximately 32 billion after deducting capital expenditures during 2020 and 2019 we also generated 40 billion of cash from operations or 31 billion in 2020 and 30 billion in 2019 after deducting capital expenditures 

• as of december 31 2021 we had 35 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand as further discussed below in january 2022 we acquired chipita sa to expand our snacks portfolio we paid approximately €13 billion 15 billion in cash and we assumed and substantially paid down €04 billion 04 billion of chipita’s debt in january for a total purchase price of approximately €17 billion 19 billion based on our current available cash and access to financing markets we do not anticipate any issue funding our obligations including funding our next longterm debt maturities of approximately 12 billion in july 2022 and 05 billion in september 2022 

• during 2021 we generated cash of approximately 15 billion from the sale of kdp shares during 2020 we also received cash of €350 million 394 million from our participation in the jde peet’s public share offerings and approximately 21 billion from our participation in the kdp secondary offering and subsequent kdp share sales see additional information below and in note 7 equity method investments  

• we also have access to shortterm and longterm financing markets and actively utilized these markets in 2020 and 2021 we continue to utilize the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for flexible lowcost shortterm financing we have issued additional longterm debt several times since the beginning of 2020 due to favorable market conditions and opportunities to shift a portion of our funding mix from shortterm debt to longterm debt at a low cost we renewed one of our credit facilities in early 2021 and now have 70 billion of undrawn credit facilities as well as other forms of shortterm and longterm financing options available as of december 31 2021 we were and we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants refer to the liquidity and capital resources section and note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  

our financial position 

• we continue to evaluate the realizability of our assets and indicators of potential impairment we reviewed our receivables inventory rightofuse lease assets longlived assets equity method and other longterm investments deferred tax assets goodwill and intangible assets 

• during the third quarter of 2021 we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets and noted no impairments over the course of the ongoing pandemic we have identified declines in demand for certain of our brands primarily in the gum category that prompted additional evaluation of our indefinitelife intangible assets during the second quarter of 2021 we concluded that one biscuit brand was impaired and we recorded a 32 million impairment charge during 2020 we concluded that eight brands were impaired and we recorded 144 million of impairment charges while we did not identify impairment triggers for other brands there continues to be significant uncertainty due to the pandemic if brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future refer to note 6 goodwill and intangible assets  for additional details on our intangible asset impairment evaluation 

• restructuring and implementation activities were in line with our simplify to grow program strategic objectives 

• our equity investments in jde peet’s and kdp give us additional financial flexibility 

• we continue to monitor the quality of our assets and our overall financial position 

• we also continue to maintain oversight over our core process controls through our centralized shared service model with key controls operating as designed 

at this point in the pandemic while we have seen some improvements in business and economic conditions across many markets in which we do business additional adverse impacts could arise such as those noted above and some that we cannot currently anticipate barring material business disruptions or other negative developments we expect to meet the demand of consumers for our snacks food and beverage products our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong but as the pandemic continues we anticipate increased volatility in revenues until covidrelated risks and current international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints subside and snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level also different markets and

tax reform 

we continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform in 2019 the most significant tax reform impact was from swiss tax reform on august 6 2019 switzerland published changes to its federal tax law in the official federal collection of laws on september 27 2019 the zurich canton published their decision on the september 1 2019 zurich canton public vote regarding the cantonal changes associated with the swiss federal tax law change the intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of 

table of contents 

internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “swiss tax reform” based on these federal  cantonal events our position is the enactment of swiss tax reform for us gaap purposes was met as of september 30 2019 and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019 the net impact was a benefit of 767 million which consisted of a 769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed stepup of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances partially offset by a 2 million indirect tax impact in selling general and administrative expenses the ongoing impacts of these swiss tax reform law changes became effective january 1 2020 see note 16 income taxes  for more information 

summary of results 

  

• net revenues were approximately 287 billion in 2021 and 266 billion in 2020 an increase of 80 in 2021 and an increase of 28 in 2020 in 2021 our net revenue growth continued to reflect increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020 though some markets were not yet back to prepandemic levels in developed markets increased food purchases for inhome consumption continued to drive net revenue growth partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped prioryear strong volume growth resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic in emerging markets we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020 with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets though some markets remained challenged in addition our outofhome consumption businesses which experienced significant negative impacts from the pandemic in 2020 continued to recover particularly our gum and candy foodservice and world travel retail businesses 

– net revenues increased in 2021 driven by favorable volumemix higher net pricing a significant impact from favorable currency translation as most currencies we operate in strengthened against the us dollar compared to exchange rates in the prior year and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of gourmet foods grenade and hu in 2021 and give  go in 2020 

– net revenues increased in 2020 driven by higher net pricing favorable volumemix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of give  go in 2020 and perfect snacks in 2019 these items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation as the us dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year as well as the may 28 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the middle east and africa 

• organic net revenue increased 52 to 280 billion in 2021 and increased 37 to 268 billion in 2020 organic net revenue increased in both 2021 and 2020 due to favorable volumemix and higher net pricing despite impacts from the covid19 pandemic described above organic net revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures we use organic net revenue as it provides improved yearoveryear comparability of our underlying operating results see the definition of organic net revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section 

• diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international increased 231 to 304 in 2021 and decreased 82 to 247 in 2020 

– diluted eps increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in adjusted eps lapping prioryear costs associated with the jde peet’s transaction favorable yearoveryear marktomarket impacts from currency and commodity derivatives lower intangible asset impairment charges lapping the prioryear loss on interest rate swaps lower losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses lower simplify to grow program costs and a net benefit from acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments these factors were partially offset by a lower gain on equity method investment transactions higher initial impacts from enacted tax law changes lower net earnings from divestitures lapping the prioryear benefit from the resolution of tax matters and higher impact from pension participation changes 

– diluted eps decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prioryear benefit from initial impacts from enacted tax law changes costs associated with the jde peets transaction loss on debt extinguishment unfavorable yearover year change in equity method investee items higher intangible asset impairment charges unfavorable yearoveryear marktomarket impacts from currency and commodity derivatives lapping a prioryear gain on divestiture and lapping the prioryear benefit from pension participation changes these factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions higher adjusted eps favorable change from the resolution of tax matters a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019 lower simplify to grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps

• adjusted eps increased 121 to 287 in 2021 and increased 67 to 256 in 2020 on a constant currency basis adjusted eps increased 90 to 279 in 2021 and increased 83 to 260 in 2020 

– for 2021 operating gains favorable currency translation fewer shares outstanding higher equity method investment earnings and lower interest expense partially offset by higher taxes primarily due to a lower net benefit from nonrecurring discrete tax items drove the adjusted eps growth 

– for 2020 operating gains an increase in benefit plan nonservice income and fewer shares outstanding partially offset by unfavorable currency translation primarily drove the adjusted eps growth 

adjusted eps and adjusted eps on a constant currency basis are nongaap financial measures we use these measures as they provide improved yearoveryear comparability of our underlying results see the definition of adjusted eps and our reconciliation with diluted eps within nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section 

financial outlook 

we seek to achieve profitable longterm growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps we use these nongaap financial metrics and related computations particularly growth in profit dollars to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near and longterm operating and strategic decisions as such we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” financial results we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business we believe our nongaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results we have provided reconciliations between our gaap and nongaap financial measures in nongaap financial measures  which appears later in this section 

in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives 

covid19 – as described above we continue to monitor and respond to the covid19 pandemic while its impact is not yet fully known it has had a material negative effect on the global and local economies and could have a material negative effect on our business and results in the future particularly if there are significant adverse changes to consumer demand or significant disruptions to the supply production or distribution of our products or the credit or financial stability of our customers and other business partners while we have seen some improvements in overall economic conditions and the business climate in many markets where we sell and operate covid19 variants such as omicron and spikes in infections continue across a number of markets if a significant economic or credit deterioration occurs it could impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a significant disruption in the financial markets may also have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts as we continue to manage operations during the pandemic we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and consumers and we may continue to incur increased labor customer service commodity transportation and other costs we could see shifts in consumer demand and product mix that could have a negative impact on results as discussed in recent developments and significant items affecting comparability  we are working to mitigate negative impacts to our business from the covid19 pandemic but we may not be able to fully predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent adverse impacts to our results any of these and other developments could materially harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

chipita acquisition – as described above on january 3 2022 we closed on our acquisition of chipita sa the cash consideration for chipita totaled €13 billion 15 billion and we assumed and substantially paid down €04 billion 04 billion of chipita’s debt in january for a total purchase price of approximately €17 billion 19 billion refer to note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  and liquidity and capital resources for additional details 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products core snacks categories continued to expand in 2021 due to the continued growth of snacking as a consumer behavior around the world as part of our strategic plan we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumerfocused commercial approach making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability 

table of contents 

across multiple channels we believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets our recent research underscores the growth of snacking worldwide and how behavior sentiment and routines surrounding food are being reshaped by covid19 snacking which was already increasing among consumers continues to grow according to snack category findings noted above and supported by the findings from the third annual state of snacking report commissioned by mondelēz international and issued in january 2022 the report was conducted in conjunction with consumer poll specialist the harris poll and summarizes the findings from interviews with thousands of consumers across 12 countries we believe that snacks continue to be a source of comfort as well as excitement and variety for consumers social media increasingly helps consumers find food trends inspiration and connection on their social media and other feeds consumers are also interested in buying snacks conveniently whether through sameday delivery apps shipped sources or different retail settings many consumers also continue to prioritize sustainability in their purchase decisions valuing sustainably sourced ingredients low carbon footprint preparation and lower waste packaging we seek to continue to offer snacks that meet consumer needs and preferences and align with our strategic priorities 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations including in emerging markets some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business as further discussed in covid19 above and in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we continue to monitor volatility in global consumer commodity transportation labor currency and capital markets that may continue until the covid19 pandemic or related issues are largely resolved we expect input cost volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue into 2022 as we manage through the pandemic and new covid19 variants the related recovery labor shortages inflation supply chain disruptions including any potential disruptions in the availability of raw materials packaging transportation energy or other supplies and adverse weather factors see also below for a discussion of brexit and argentina which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018 in addition the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in us trade programs trade relations regulations taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability to help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs including hedging and pricing as well as targeted investments in our brands and new routes to market 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a localfirst commercial focus new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives product innovation and high standards of product quality we also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

pricing – our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions such as increasing input and operating costs due to supply transportation and labor constraints and higher cost trends we experienced particularly in the second half of 2021 we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including market factors transportation logistics and changes in our product input costs and we have increased prices to control costs given recent significant cost inflation however we may not be able to adjust pricing fully or timely in response to rising costs and this may negatively affect our revenue margins or earnings 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning to remain competitive on our operating structure we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability such as our simplify to grow program which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs during the second half of 2021 in particular we experienced higher operating costs including higher overall raw material transportation labor and fuel costs that we anticipate will continue into 2022

taxes – we continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world during november 2021 the us house of representatives passed a bill that contains significant changes to currently enacted us tax rules but the senate has not yet acted on it in december 2021 the oecd released model rules for a global minimum tax both of these proposed legislative changes could have a material effect on us if enacted 

currency – as a global company with 751 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our nonus operations we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results to partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currencydenominated debt crosscurrency swaps and other financial instruments while we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position see additional discussion of brexit and argentina below and refer also to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  and note 10 financial instruments  for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks as currency movements can make comparison of yearoveryear operating performance challenging we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis holding prioryear currency exchange rates constant so that prioryear and currentyear results can be compared on a consistent basis 

brexit – following brexit in 2020 a new trade arrangement was reached between the uk and eu that began on january 1 2021 the main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the uk and eu subject to prescribed trade terms including but not limited to meeting product and labeling standards for both the uk and eu crossborder trade between the uk and eu is also subject to new customs regulations documentation and reviews our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods to comply with the new requirements we increased resources in customer service and logistics in our factories and on our customs support teams we adapted our processes and systems for the new and increased number of customs transactions we continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials packaging and finished goods in the uk we have made investments in resources systems and processes to meet the new ongoing requirements and we work to mitigate disruptions to our local supply chain and distribution including those related to the recent transportation labor shortage in the uk to reduce the impact on our input and distribution costs despite our efforts to control costs inflationary cost pressures increased in our uk business in 2021 as we also experienced in other markets if the uk’s separation from or new trade arrangements with the eu negatively impact the uk economy or result in disagreements on trade terms delays affecting our supply chain or distribution disruptions to sales or collections or further increases in inflationary cost pressures the impact to our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be material in 2021 we generated 93 of our consolidated net revenues in the uk 

uk advertising and promotion ban – in the united kingdom a ban on specific types of tv and online advertising of food containing levels of fat sugar or salt above specified thresholds is expected to go into effect in 2023 and new measures restricting certain promotions and instore placement of some of those products are expected to go into effect in october 2022 although we are unable to estimate precisely the impact of the restrictions they could significantly negatively affect our uk results of operations in 2022 and thereafter 

argentina – as further discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting on july 1 2018 we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our argentinean subsidiaries as a result we recorded a remeasurement loss of 13 million in 2021 a remeasurement loss of 9 million in 2020 and a remeasurement gain of 4 million in 2019 within selling general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods the mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert argentinean pesos to us dollars could change over time so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings 

gum portfolio review – during 2021 we began and continue to conduct a strategic review of our developed market gum business we expect to complete the review and have more information in mid 2022

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lowcost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases we continued to secure lowcost short and longterm debt during 2021 in september 2021 we issued our first green bonds raising nearly €20 billion and enabling us to costeffectively fund eligible projects that align with our sustainability priorities in the areas of building a thriving ingredient supply chain and reducing our environmental impact in september 2021 through our subsidiary mondelez international holdings netherlands bv “mihn” we also issued €300 million of zero interest exchangeable notes that are redeemable for cash or existing ordinary shares of jde peets at our option we also continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt we also enter into crosscurrency interest rate swaps forwards and option collars to hedge our nonus net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates our net investment hedge derivative contracts have had and are expected to have a favorable impact and reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  and note 10 financial instruments  for additional information on our debt and derivative activity 

cybersecurity risks – global cybersecurity risks continue to increase including during the pandemic and as more employees are working remotely and virtually outside of traditional workplaces in response we continue to be on heightened alert and dedicate focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery and to provide ongoing workforce training and employ security measures to protect our systems and data we are also focusing on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats while we have taken security measures to protect our systems and data security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis

consolidated results of operations 

the following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2021 with 2020 and 2020 with 2019 

2021 compared with 2020 



net revenues – net revenues increased 2139 million 80 to 28720 million in 2021 and organic net revenue increased 1388 million 52 to 27969 million developed markets net revenues increased 63 and developed markets organic net revenue increased 16 emerging markets net revenues increased 114 and emerging markets organic net revenue increased 122 the underlying changes in net revenues and organic net revenue are detailed below 



  

1 please see the nongaap financial measures section at the end of this item 

net revenue increase of 80 was driven by our underlying organic net revenue growth of 52 favorable currency the impact of acquisitions and the partial year contribution of a business divested on november 1 2021 which had been part of an earlier 2021 acquisition overall we continued to see increased demand for our snack category products though parts of our business were not yet back to prepandemic levels in developed markets increased food purchases for inhome consumption continued to drive net revenue growth partially offset by declines in some markets as they lapped strong volume growth in 2020 resulting from increased consumer demand due to the pandemic in emerging markets we lapped the negative initial impacts we experienced from the pandemic in 2020 with strong revenue growth in 2021 across most of our key markets though some markets remained challenged in addition sales of our gum and candy products grew as outofhome consumption continued to recover as did our world travel business as global travel improved though still below prepandemic levels favorable currency translation and incremental net revenues from acquisitions also added to revenue growth in 2021 

organic net revenue growth was driven by favorable volumemix and higher net pricing favorable volumemix in europe amea and latin america was primarily driven by strong volume gains as we lapped the significant negative impacts of the pandemic in many of our key markets this was partially offset by unfavorable volumemix in north america as the region lapped very strong prioryear volume growth from significant food purchases for inhome consumption due to the pandemic higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2020 as well as the effects of input costdriven pricing actions taken during 2021 favorable currency impacts

2020 compared with 2019 



net revenues – net revenues increased 713 million 28 to 26581 million in 2020 and organic net revenue increased 960 million 37 to 26773 million developed markets net revenue increased 80 and developed 

markets organic net revenue increased 45 emerging markets net revenues decreased 60 including an unfavorable currency impact and emerging markets organic net revenue increased 23 the underlying changes in net revenues and organic net revenue are detailed below

net revenue increase of 28 was driven by our underlying organic net revenue growth of 37 and the impact of acquisitions mostly offset by unfavorable currency and the impact of a prioryear divestiture net revenues were higher in developed markets particularly north america where due to the covid19 outbreak and response demand for our products primarily biscuits and chocolate grew significantly as consumers increased their food purchases for inhome consumption however our gum and candy categories as well as our world travel retail and foodservice businesses were negatively impacted by covid19 in emerging markets where we have a greater concentration of traditional trade several markets were challenged by covid19 impacts particularly those with significant gum and candy portfolios overall as the negative impacts of covid19 experienced in the first half of the year subsided in the second half of the year revenue growth began to recover in a number of our key emerging markets though overall emerging markets net revenues declined due to unfavorable currency impacts 

organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volumemix higher net pricing in all regions except europe was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2019 as well as the effects of input costdriven pricing actions taken during 2020 favorable volumemix in north america and europe partially offset by unfavorable volumemix in latin america and amea included strong volume gains tempered by unfavorable mix reflecting shifts in consumer purchases in response to the covid19 outbreak the april 1 2020 acquisition of give  go added incremental net revenues of 390 million and the july 16 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in perfect snacks added incremental net revenues of 55 million in 2020 unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by 637 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most currencies including the brazilian real argentinean peso russian ruble mexican peso indian rupee south african rand and turkish lira partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the us dollar including the euro philippine peso british pound sterling egyptian pound and swedish krona the impact of the may 28 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the middle east and africa resulted in a yearoveryear decline in net revenues of 55 million refer to note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  for more information

during 2020 we realized higher net pricing and favorable volumemix which was largely offset by increased input costs higher net pricing which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2019 as well as the effects of input costdriven pricing actions taken during 2020 was reflected in all regions except europe favorable volumemix was driven by north america and europe which was partially offset by unfavorable volumemix in latin america and amea the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity net of incremental covid19 related costs higher raw material costs were in part due to higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials as well as higher cocoa dairy sugar energy packaging nuts grains and other ingredients costs partially offset by lower costs for oils 

total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 38 million from 2019 due to a number of factors noted in the table above including in part a favorable currency impact related to expenses favorable change from the resolution of tax matters a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019 lower implementation costs incurred for the simplify to grow program lapping prioryear valueadded tax “vat” related settlements lapping prioryear ceo transition remuneration and lapping the prioryear divestiture these decreases were partially offset by the impact of acquisitions costs associated with the jde peets transaction lapping the benefit from prioryear pension participation changes unfavorable change in remeasurement of net monetary position in argentina remeasurement loss in 2020 as compared to a remeasurement gain in 2019 and higher acquisitionrelated costs excluding these factors selling general and administrative expenses increased 77 million from 2019 the increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs partially offset by lower overhead spending net of incremental covid19 related costs 

we recorded an expense of 11 million from a vatrelated settlement in latin america in 2019 unfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by 59 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most currencies including the brazilian real russian ruble indian rupee swiss franc south african rand and turkish lira partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the us dollar including the euro egyptian pound philippine peso british pound sterling and swedish krona 

operating income margin decreased from 149 in 2019 to 145 in 2020 the decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the yearoveryear unfavorable change in marktomarket gainslosses from currency and commodity hedging activities higher intangible asset impairment charges costs associated with the jde peets transaction lapping the prioryear gain on a divestiture and lapping the benefit from prioryear pension participation changes partially offset by the favorable impact from the resolution of tax matters and lower costs for the simplify to grow program adjusted operating income margin increased from 165 in 2019 to 166 in 2020 the increase in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by higher pricing lower manufacturing costs reflecting productivity net of incremental covd19 costs and selling general and administrative cost leverage mostly offset by higher raw material costs

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets  

we test goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on july 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead in our quantitative testing we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for our europe and north america reporting units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 64 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america and amea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 94 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of covid19 those estimates could be significantly different than future performance if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value 

in 2021 2020 and 2019 there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2021 annual impairment testing each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

annually we assess indefinitelife intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value we determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

during 2021 we recorded 32 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a biscuit brand in north america the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we use several accepted valuation methods including relief of royalty excess earnings and excess margin that utilize estimates of future sales earnings growth rates royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brands global fair value we also identified eight brands with 1146 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2021 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less we continue to monitor our brand performance particularly in light of the significant uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic and related impacts to our business if the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future in 2020 we recorded 144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy brands with 83 million in north america 53 million in europe 5 million in amea and 3 million in latin america in 2019 we recorded 57 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy brands with 39 million in europe 15 million in amea and 3 million in latin america

trade and marketing programs 

we promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs these programs include but are not limited to new product introduction fees discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives as well as cooperative advertising instore displays and consumer marketing promotions trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits for accounting purposes we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates expected returns on plan assets expected compensation increases employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality and health care cost trends we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses for plans that have assets held in trust the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2021 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease on our annual benefit plan costs 



see additional information on our employee benefit plans in note 11 benefit plans  

income taxes 

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

table of contents 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities whether by settlement with tax authorities judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our revolving credit facilities shortterm borrowings and our authorized longterm financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions share repurchases and quarterly dividends we expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed we continually evaluate longterm debt issuances to meet our short and longerterm funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility our investments in jde peets and kdp also provide us additional flexibility overall we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity and to date we have been successful in raising financing as needed including during the pandemic and generally on favorable terms however in connection with the covid19 pandemic or otherwise if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

our most significant ongoing shortterm cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations including expenditures for raw materials labor manufacturing and distribution trade and promotions advertising and marketing tax liabilities benefit plan obligations and lease expenses as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions shareholder returns such as dividend payments and share repurchases and property plant and equipment 

longterm cash requirements primarily relate to funding longterm debt repayments refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  our us tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes refer to note 16 income taxes  our longterm benefit plan obligations refer to note 11 benefit plans  and commodityrelated purchase commitments and derivative contracts refer to note 10 financial instruments  

we generally fund short and longterm cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short and longterm debt financing refer to debt below we generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations 

cash flow 

we believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short and longterm financial commitments our cash flow activity over the last three years is noted below 

net cash provided by operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was due primarily to higher earnings and lower working capital requirements partially offset by higher tax payments and lower dividends received from our equity method investments net cash provided by operating activities was largely flat in 2020 relative to 2019 as higher cash tax payments in 2020 primarily related to sales of kdp and jde peets shares and the resolution of several indirect tax matters under a tax amnesty program in india and the payment of costs associated with the jde peets transaction in 2020 were largely offset by working capital improvements 

net cash used inprovided by investing activities 

net cash from investing activities was lower in 2021 due primarily to lower cash proceeds from partial sales of our equity method investment shares refer to note 7 equity method investments  and higher capital expenditures partially offset by less cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 for hu grenade and gourmet food than in 2020 for give  go refer to note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to cash received from the sale of shares in the jde peets and kdp offerings and lower capital expenditures partially offset by cash paid to acquire a majority interest in give  go 

capital expenditures were 965 million in 2021 863 million in 2020 and 925 million in 2019 we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2022 capital expenditures to be up to 12 billion including capital expenditures in connection 

table of contents 

with our simplify to grow program and for funding our strategic priorities we expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher amounts of net longterm debt repayments higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2021 than in 2020 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020 

chipita acquisition 

on january 3 2022 we closed on our acquisition of chipita sa the cash consideration for chipita totaled €13 billion 15 billion and we assumed and substantially paid down €04 billion 04 billion of chipitas debt in january for a total purchase price of approximately €17 billion 19 billion cash paid for the business was raised from cash from operations and by issuing longterm debt in the third quarter of 2021 refer to note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  and note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  for additional details 

supply chain financing 

as part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions which include the extension of payment terms our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers are from 30 to 180 days which we deem to be commercially reasonable we also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing “scf” programs through several participating financial institutions under these programs our suppliers at their sole discretion determine invoices that they want to sell to participating financial institutions our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in scf programs has no bearing on our payment terms or amounts due our responsibility is limited to making payments based upon the agreedupon contractual terms no guarantees are provided by the company or any of our subsidiaries under the scf programs and we have no economic interest in the suppliers’ decision to participate in the scf programs amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the scf program are included in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet we have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 25 billion and 21 billion respectively of our accounts payable to suppliers that participate in the scf programs are outstanding 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 14 commitments and contingencies  we enter into thirdparty guarantees primarily to cover the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of these transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2021 we had no material thirdparty guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity

the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors due to seasonality in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital or other financing needs 

refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  for a projection of longterm debt scheduled to mature including current maturities and finance leases in future periods in the next 12 months we expect to repay approximately 17 billion of maturing longterm debt including 12 billion in july 2022 and 05 billion in september 2022 we fund ongoing debt maturities and other longterm obligations using cash on hand or we may refinance obligations with longterm debt or shortterm financing such as our commercial paper borrowings depending on financing available timing considerations flexibility to raise funding and the cost of financing 

during december 2021 our board of directors approved a new 70 billion longterm financing authority to replace the prior 60 billion authority as of december 31 2021 all 70 billion of the longterm financing authorization remained available 

our total debt was 195 billion at december 31 2021 and 200 billion at december 31 2020 our debttocapitalization ratio was 041 at december 31 2021 and 042 at december 31 2020 the weightedaverage term of

our outstanding longterm debt was 95 years at december 31 2021 and 74 years at december 31 2020 our average daily commercial borrowings were 05 billion in 2021 23 billion in 2020 and 41 billion in 2019 we had commercial paper borrowings of 02 billion at december 31 2021 and no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2020 we expect to continue to use cash or commercial paper to finance various shortterm financing needs as of december 31 2021 we continued to be in compliance with our debt covenants 

one of our subsidiaries mihn has outstanding debt refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  the operations held by mihn generated approximately 735 or 211 billion of the 287 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2021 and represented approximately 792 or 224 billion of the 283 billion of net assets as of december 31 2021

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production during 2021 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher foreign currency transaction costs on imported materials as well as increased costs for edible oils packaging sugar cocoa grains dairy and other ingredients 

a number of external factors such as the current covid19 pandemic climate and weather conditions commodity transportation and labor market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes such as dairy where there is a limited ability to hedge and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

as a result of international supply chain transportation and labor market disruptions and generally higher 

commodity transportation and labor costs in the second half of 2021 we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2022 while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we use nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have detailed the nongaap adjustments that we make in our nongaap definitions below the adjustments generally fall within the following categories acquisition and divestiture activities gains and losses on intangible asset sales and noncash impairments major program restructuring activities constant currency and related adjustments major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results we believe the nongaap measures should always be considered along with the related us gaap financial measures we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and nongaap financial measures below and we also discuss our underlying gaap results throughout our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k 

our primary nongaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prioryear operating results as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change when our definitions change we provide the updated definitions and present the related nongaap historical results on a comparable basis 1  

• “organic net revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures 2 and currency rate fluctuations 3  we also evaluate organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets 

• our emerging markets include our latin america region in its entirety the amea region excluding australia new zealand and japan and the following countries from the europe region russia ukraine türkiye kazakhstan georgia poland czech republic slovak republic hungary bulgaria romania the baltics and the east adriatic countries

• “adjusted eps” is defined as diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the adjusted operating income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans net earnings from divestitures 2  and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions similarly within adjusted eps our equity method investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investees’ significant operating and nonoperating items 11  we also evaluate growth in our adjusted eps on a constant currency basis 3  

1 when items no longer impact our current or future presentation of nongaap operating results we remove these items from our nongaap definitions in the second quarter of 2021 we added to the nongaap definitions the exclusion of initial impacts from enacted tax law changes refer to footnote 10 below in the third quarter of 2021 we also added the exclusion of contingent consideration adjustments refer to footnote 2 below and the marktomarket impacts from equity method investment transaction derivatives contracts refer to footnote 6 below 

2 divestitures include completed sales of businesses including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement as we record our share of kdp and jde peet’s ongoing earnings on a onequarter lag basis any kdp or jde peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our nongaap results the following quarter during the third quarter of 2021 we began to exclude the impact of certain adjustments made to our acquisition contingent consideration liabilities that were recorded at the date of acquisition we made this adjustment to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  and note 7 equity method investments  for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results

3 constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying as appropriate the currentperiod local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prioryear period to determine what the currentperiod us dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prioryear period 

4 nongaap adjustments related to the simplify to grow program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the nongaap adjustments 

5 during the third quarter of 2018 as we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for argentina refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  we excluded the remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in argentina during the period to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gainslosses for venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to deconsolidation in 2015 

6 we exclude unrealized gains and losses marktomarket impacts from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative from our nongaap earnings measures the marktomarket impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods we exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures

8 on november 20 2017 dirk van de put succeeded irene rosenfeld as ceo of mondelēz international in advance of her retirement at the end of march 2018 in order to incent mr van de put to join us we provided him compensation with a total combined target value of 425 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer the compensation we granted took the form of cash deferred stock units performance share units and stock options in connection with irene rosenfeld’s retirement we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 20162018 and 20172019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a 05 million salary for her service as chairman from january through march 2018 we refer to these elements of mr van de put’s and ms rosenfeld’s compensation arrangements together as “ceo transition remuneration” we are excluding amounts we expense as ceo transition remuneration from our nongaap results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing ceo compensation as a result in 2017 we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to mr van de put and partial vesting of his equity grants in 2018 we excluded amounts paid for ms rosenfeld’s service as chairman and partial vesting of mr van de put’s and ms rosenfeld’s equity grants in 2019 we excluded amounts related to the partial vesting of mr van de put’s equity grants during the first quarter of 2020 mr van de puts equity grants became fully vested 

9 the impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation we exclude these charges from our non–gaap results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations see note 11 benefit plans  for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal 

10 we have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 us tax reform previously we only excluded the initial impacts from more material tax reforms specifically the impacts of the 2019 swiss tax reform and 2017 us tax reform we exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our adjusted eps as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes refer to note 16 income taxes  for more information on the impact of swiss and us tax reform 

11 we have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ significant operating and nonoperating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and nonoperating items each reporting period we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control our gaap “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ significant operating and nonoperating items 

we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures vary among companies the nongaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measures a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic and related global response significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world national and local governments imposed preventative or protective restrictions on travel and business operations and advised or required citizens to remain at home temporary closures of businesses were ordered and numerous other businesses temporarily closed voluntarily the impact of the global pandemic and response has had a material unfavorable impact on global markets including commodity currency and capital markets while some of these markets such as the us and other major stock markets and certain currencies have rebounded significantly in the second and third quarters of 2020 these markets are likely to continue to remain volatile while the situation continues an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts we are actively working to mitigate these risks and we largely employed existing strategies that are described below to mitigate these market risks related to currency commodity and interest rate risks 

we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 10 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by operating segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results throughout our discussion and analysis of results we isolate currency impacts and supplementally provide net revenues operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis for additional information on the impact of currency policies recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions such as the current covid19 global pandemic refer to recent developments and significant items affecting comparability and financial outlook above for updates on recent supply chain transportation labor and other disruptions that are increasing operating costs and impacting our results to manage input cost volatility and inflation we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings 

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to london interbank offered rates “libor” the last publication date of libor rates against various currencies by the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom was december 31 2021 with the publication of certain usd rates being phased out after june 30 2023 we did not have a significant impact to our financial position from the phase out of libor nor do we expect a significant impact from the remaining phase out given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2021 and 2020 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 



this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

a number of external factors such as changing weather patterns and conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

due to factors noted above the costs of our principal raw materials can fluctuate at this time we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources however we continue to monitor the longterm impacts of climate change and related factors that could affect the availability or cost of raw materials packaging and energy for additional information on our commodity costs refer to the commodity trends section within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information on our ongoing sustainability efforts and programs refer to sustainability and mindful snacking below

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business operating results liquidity and financial condition while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business performance or financial condition in the future 

strategic and operational risks 

global or regional health pandemics or epidemics including covid19 could negatively impact our business operations financial performance and results of operations 

our business and financial results could be negatively impacted by the outbreak of covid19 or other pandemics or epidemics the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic is uncertain rapidly changing and hard to predict in 2020 covid19 significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and it could negatively impact our business in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• the covid19 outbreak has resulted and could continue to result in lower revenues in some of our emerging market countries that have a higher concentration of traditional trade outlets such as small familyrun stores as well as in our travel retail such as international dutyfree stores and foodservice businesses we are unable to predict how long these trends will continue or whether they will worsen 

• in addition sales of some of our products for inhome consumption in some markets and channels such as the united states and some european markets and modern trade increased in 2020 we are unable to predict how long this sustained demand will last or how significant it will be 

• the covid19 outbreak has disrupted and could materially disrupt our global supply chain operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our comanufacturers or distributors the outbreak has also necessitated increased expenditures to secure the safety and effectiveness of our personnel and operations disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs or cause delays in delivering or an inability to deliver products to our customers for example we experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging markets such as india and nigeria in the first half of 2020 

• disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 outbreak for a sustained period of time could result in delays or modifications to our strategic plans and initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our objective to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs through our simplify to grow program 

• illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions have affected and could materially negatively affect our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business processes 

• government or regulatory responses to pandemics could negatively impact our business mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in some countries temporarily disrupted our ability to distribute our products in some markets continuation or expansion of these disruptions could materially adversely impact our operations and results 

• commodity costs have become more volatile due to the covid19 outbreak we expect continued commodity cost volatility and our commodity hedging activities cannot fully offset this volatility 

• initially during the covid19 outbreak the us dollar appreciated materially against other currencies in the countries in which we operate resulting in currency translation losses if the us dollar were to appreciate 

table of contents 

again against some or all of those same currencies the resulting currency translation losses along with currency transaction losses could adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition 

• the covid19 outbreak initially increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and commercial paper markets and volatility may increase again as covid19 evolves we might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like or on terms we find acceptable and our borrowing costs could increase an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts 

these and other impacts of the covid19 or other global or regional health pandemics or epidemics could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors below including but not limited to those relating to our reputation brands consumer preferences supply chain product sales results of operations or financial condition we might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results the ultimate impact of these disruptions also depends on events beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of the covid19 and other outbreaks and actions taken by parties other than us to respond to them any of these disruptions could have a negative impact on our business operations financial performance and results of operations which impact could be material additionally covid19 may also materially adversely affect our operating results and financial position in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our operations 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we face risks related to the execution of our strategy and our timely response to channel shifts and pricing and other competitive pressures 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include food snack and beverage companies that operate in multiple geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies failure to effectively respond to challenges from our competitors could adversely affect our business 

competitor and customer pressures require that we timely and effectively respond to changes in distribution channels and technological developments that may require changes in our prices these pressures could affect our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively and timely assess new or developing trends technological advancements or changes in distribution methods and set proper pricing or effective trade incentives will negatively impact our operating results achievement of our strategic and financial goals and our ability to capitalize on new revenue or valueproducing opportunities the rapid growth of some channels in particular in ecommerce which has expanded significantly following the outbreak of covid19 may impact our current operations or strategies more quickly than we planned for create consumer price deflation alter the buying behavior of consumers or disrupt our retail customer relationships we may need to increase or reallocate spending on existing and new distribution channels and technologies marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase revenues market share and brand significance these expenditures may not be successful including those related to our ecommerce and other technologyfocused efforts and might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows these new distribution channels as well as growing opportunities to utilize external manufacturers lower barriers to entry and allow smaller competitors to more effectively gain market share additionally if we reduce prices but cannot increase sales volumes or our labor or other costs increase but we cannot increase prices to offset those changes our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

during 2020 we continued to operate under our strategy which focuses on accelerating consumercentric and volumedriven growth operational excellence driven by cost discipline and continuous operational improvement including in areas like sales execution and building a winning growth culture with a “local first” commercial approach failure to achieve these objectives or effectively operate under our strategy in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

promoting and protecting our reputation and brand image and health is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands expand to new geographies and new distribution platforms including ecommerce and evolve our portfolio with new product offerings that meet consumer expectations 

we seek to strengthen our brands through investments in our product quality product renovation innovation and marketing investments including consumerrelevant advertising digital transformation and consumer promotions failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on consumercentric wellbeing including changing consumer acceptance of certain ingredients nutritional expectations of our products and the sustainability of our ingredients our supply chain and our packaging could adversely affect our brands increased negative attention from the media governments shareholders and other stakeholders in these areas as well as on the role of food marketing and other environmental social or governance practices could adversely affect our brand image undue caution or inaction on our part in addressing these challenges and trends could weaken our competitive position such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations industry selfregulation that is unevenly adopted among companies and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increasing legal or regulatory restrictions on our labeling advertising and consumer promotions such as agebased restrictions on sales of products with certain nutritional profiles enacted in some states in mexico and other restrictions being considered in the united kingdom or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity regulatory developments or legal action against us our employees or our licensees related to product quality and safety where and how we manufacture our products environmental risks human and workplace rights across our supply chain or antitrust antibribery and anticorruption compliance could damage our reputation and brand health such actions could undermine our customers’ and shareholders’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations our product sponsorship relationships including those with celebrity spokespersons influencers or group affiliations could also subject us to negative publicity 

in addition our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on established and emerging social media and online platforms digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns targeted marketing and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions limit how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our brand renovation innovation marketing and promotion plans particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about mondelēz international our brands or our employees on social media or web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media accounts and failure to respond effectively to these posts comments or activities could damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate our brands may be associated with or appear alongside harmful content before these platforms or our own social media monitoring can detect this risk to our brand health in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brands our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results and we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill furthermore third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks when consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future which could harm our brand image and sales failure to successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health could materially and adversely affect our company and product brands as well as our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new and improved products that meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences in the places and ways consumers want to shop there may be further shifts in the relative size of shopping channels in addition to the increasing role of ecommerce for consumers our success relies upon managing this complexity to promote and bring our products to consumers effectively moreover weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other factors such as global or local pandemics and severe or unusual weather events affect consumer preferences and demand such as the increased demand for biscuits and decreased demand for gum since the start of the covid19 pandemic failure to offer products that appeal to consumers or to correctly judge consumer 

table of contents 

demand for our products will impact our ability to meet our growth targets and our sales and market share could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads and trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences when we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences or category trends will be longterm or fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy changing preferences our sales can be adversely affected in addition because of our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must be responsive to local consumer needs including with respect to when and how consumers snack and their desire for premium or value offerings provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences and use marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message failure to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories or reach consumers in efficient and effective ways leveraging data and analytics could cause demand for our products to decrease and our profitability to suffer 

negative perceptions concerning the health environmental and social implications of certain food products ingredients packaging materials sourcing or production methods could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers have increasingly focused on wellbeing including reducing sodium and added sugar consumption as well as the source and authenticity of the foods they consume continuing to expand our wellbeing offerings and refining the ingredient and nutrition profiles of existing products is important to our growth as is maintaining focus on ethical sourcing and supply chain management opportunities to address evolving consumer preferences in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and other activities to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions or failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 732 of our 2020 net revenues 744 of our 2019 net revenues and 753 of our 2018 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries therefore we are subject to risks inherent in global operations those risks include 

• compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states including antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” 

• the imposition of increased or new tariffs sanctions quotas trade barriers price floors or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities like cocoa potential changes in us trade programs and trade relations with other countries or regulations taxes or policies that might negatively affect our sales or profitability 

• compliance with antitrust and competition laws trade laws data privacy laws antibribery laws human rights laws and a variety of other local national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple regimes 

• currency devaluations or fluctuations in currency values including in developing markets such as argentina brazil china india mexico russia ukraine turkey egypt nigeria south africa and pakistan as well as in developed markets such as the united kingdom and countries within the european union this includes events like applying highly inflationary accounting as we did for our argentinean subsidiaries beginning in july 2018 

• changes in capital controls including currency exchange controls government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the united states 

• increased sovereign risk such as default by or deterioration in the economies and credit ratings of governments particularly in our latin america and amea regions 

• changes or inconsistencies in local regulations and laws the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in nonus jurisdictions and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources 

• varying abilities to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights 

• discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies 

• greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles and 

• design implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee base

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war government shutdowns travel or immigration restrictions tariffs and other trade restrictions public health risks or pandemics including covid19 public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties including inaccuracies in our assumptions about these factors could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand high unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the transition period following the united kingdom’s exit from the european union “brexit” could have a negative effect on our business see below and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial outlook – brexit for more information 

all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations cash flows and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or long term 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including among others brazil china india mexico russia argentina the middle east africa southeast asia and ukraine however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries particularly those with emerging economies engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws may be more common these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and lowcost local manufacturers improve and expand their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy failure to successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks could adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our use of information technology and thirdparty service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions 

we use information technology and thirdparty service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations such as manufacturing and distribution communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls executing mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services important to conducting our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware including the june 2017 malware incident that affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks the “malware incident” other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security power outages hardware or software failures denial of service attacks telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences our use of new and emerging technologies such as cloudbased services and mobile applications continues to evolve presenting new and additional risks in managing access to our data relying on thirdparties to manage and safeguard data ensuring access to our systems and availability of thirdparty systems 

cybersecurity breaches of our or thirdparty systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks such as hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause 

table of contents 

confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached these risks could be magnified given the increased number of employees contractors and others working outside of offices during the covid19 pandemic when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various thirdparty service providers and for thirdparty service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might increase challenges and costs to resolve related issues additionally new initiatives such as those related to ecommerce and direct sales that increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain increase our potential exposure from a cybersecurity breach if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our thirdparty providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data such as advanced email protection to reduce the likelihood of credential thefts and electronic fraud attempts we also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on the updated threat however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis due to the constantly evolving and complex nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly 

we regularly transfer data across national borders to conduct our operations and we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which has greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of eu law and became effective in may 2018 added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance of up to 4 of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year in addition to potential restrictions on data transfer and processing the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective in january 2020 imposed new responsibilities on us for the handling disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in california the ccpa permits california to assess potentially significant fines for violating ccpa and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations in addition the california privacy rights act ballot initiative passed in november 2020 will create a new agency dedicated to data privacy that will be required to implement more stringent privacy regulations by january 1 2023 our efforts to comply with gdpr ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

we are subject to risks from unanticipated business disruptions 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we utilize an integrated supply chain – a complex network of suppliers and material needs owned and leased manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks shared service delivery centers and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters water availability supply and commodity shortages terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches generalized labor unrest government shutdowns or health pandemics such as covid19 could damage or disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our comanufacturers or distributors failure to effectively prepare for and respond to disruptions in our operations for example by not finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations or by not quickly repairing damage to our information production or supply systems can cause delays in delivering or the inability to deliver products to our customers as we experienced in connection with the malware incident and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected the occurrence of a material or extended disruption may cause us to lose our customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline 

table of contents 

some risks are difficult or impossible to insure through the insurance programs we use to transfer many of these risks and the timing of insurance recoveries may not match the timing of our financial loss in addition we are subject to risk related to our own execution this includes risk of disruption caused by operational error including fire explosion or accidental contamination as well as our inability to achieve our strategic objectives due to capability or technology deficiencies related to our ongoing reconfiguration of our supply chain to drive efficiencies and fuel growth further our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity significant changes in trade policies changes in volume produced and changes to regulatory restrictions or laborrelated or other constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of product packaging materials natural gas fuel and electricity for our factories and warehouses and we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products costs of raw materials other supplies and services and energy are volatile and fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations geopolitical conditions or conflicts tariffs or other trade barriers government intervention to introduce living income premiums or similar requirements such as those announced in 2019 in two of the main cocoagrowing countries severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics including covid19 forest fires consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental environmental or trade policy and regulations alternative energy and agricultural programs increased government intervention and consumer or activist responses caused by increased focus on climate change deforestation water plastic waste animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products including increases to cover higher input packaging and transportation costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities and necessary services such as transportation may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints our financial condition results of operations and cash flows can be materially adversely affected 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners in addition execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline 

table of contents 

operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate as appropriate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and similar strategic alliances pose additional risks as we share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time who may not have the same priorities strategies or resources as we do or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own strategic alliances we have entered into include our investments in jde peets nv and keurig dr pepper inc transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and nonfinancial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits depending on the nature of the business ventures including whether they operate globally these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are including political economic regulatory and compliance risks currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility of commodity and other input prices either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected 

furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

macroeconomic and industry risks 

climate change might adversely impact our supply chain or our operations 

scientific evidence collected by the intergovernmental panel on climate change demonstrates that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe these changes are expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters and affect water availability and quality these impacts increase risks for the global food production and distribution system decreased agricultural productivity caused by climate change might limit the availability of the commodities we purchase and use these include cocoa which is a critical raw material for our chocolate and biscuit portfolios that is particularly sensitive to changes in climate as well as other raw materials such as wheat vegetable oils sugar nuts and dairy localized weather events such as floods severe storms or water shortages that are partially caused or exacerbated by climate change are physical risks that might disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our comanufacturers or distributors 

concern about climate change might result in new legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change these changes could increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging through taxes or regulations including payments under extended producer responsibility policies concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact furthermore we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media shareholders activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters including deforestation land use water use and packaging including plastic finally the fact that consumers are exposed to rising temperatures could affect demand for our products such as decreased demand we have experienced for chocolate during periods when temperatures are warmer 

taken together these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet the needs of our customers reputation product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets discounters ecommerce merchants warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and other major markets continue to consolidate form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market resulting in fewer larger customers large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and 

table of contents 

demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or longer payment terms retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels and has increased further in response to the covid19 pandemic the emergence of alternative online retail channels such as direct to consumer and ebusiness to business may adversely affect our relationships with our large retail and wholesale customers 

in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products when they perceive little difference between the quality or value of our products and those of retailer or other economy brands when consumers prefer or otherwise choose to purchase the retailer or other economy brands we can lose market share or sales volumes or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

failure to effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers suppliers and distributors 

during 2020 our five largest customers accounted for 175 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

disputes with significant suppliers or distributors including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply or deliver products to our customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations in addition the financial condition of our significant customers suppliers and distributors are affected by events that are largely beyond our control such as the covid19 pandemic deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers suppliers or distributors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce and respond to shifts in labor availability 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel with a variety of capabilities in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned or increased turnover of employees with key capabilities failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as ecommerce and digital marketing skills or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or to hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness we could face unforeseen challenges in the availability of labor such as we have experienced since the outbreak of covid19 changes in our operating model and business processes including building a winning growth culture implementing our “local first” commercial approach utilizing our global shared services capability and reconfiguring our supply chain could lead to operational challenges and changes in the skills we require to achieve our business goals failure to achieve a more diverse workforce and leadership team compensate our employees competitively and fairly or maintain a safe and inclusive environment could affect our reputation and also result in lower performance and an inability to retain valuable employees 

table of contents 

we must address changes in and that affect our workforce and satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 63 of our 67000 employees outside the united states and approximately 26 of our 12000 us employees strikes work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers or distributors or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could cause disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing or distribution processes changes in immigration laws and policies including in connection with brexit or restrictions such as those imposed in connection with the covid19 pandemic could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

legal and regulatory risks 

we face risks related to complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate 

our activities around the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production packaging and waste management storage distribution sales advertising labeling and marketing as well as intellectual property competition antitrust trade labor tax and environmental matters privacy data protection and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations as well as their interpretations of existing laws and regulations our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or to make changes necessary to comply with new or revised laws and regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows for instance our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in the corporate tax policies of the united states and other countries trade relations among the united states and other countries including china mexico and the european union and changes within the european union such as brexit 

in connection with brexit on december 24 2020 the european union and the united kingdom reached an agreement on a new trade arrangement that became effective on january 1 2021 main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the uk and eu so long as we meet prescribed trade terms we will also need to meet product and labeling standards for both the uk and eu the uk may also set its own trade policies with countries such as the united states australia and new zealand that currently do not have free trade agreements with the eu crossborder trade between the uk and eu will be subject to new customs regulations documentation and reviews we anticipate increased shipping costs and nearterm delays because of the need for ongoing customs inspections and related procedures our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods volatility in foreign currencies and other markets may also arise as the uk and eu work though the new trade arrangements once the new rules are formalized there could be other near or longterm negative impacts any disagreements on trade terms or supply chain or distribution delays or other disruptions could negatively affect our uk business see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial outlook – brexit for more information 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed deliberate or unintentional product contamination including contamination of ingredients we use in our products that third parties supply spoilage or other adulteration product mislabeling or product tampering these risks could be heightened in light of increased pressure on our suppliers from the covid19 pandemic onsite quality audits of third parties such as suppliers external manufacturers and trademark licensees have been limited by travel restrictions and heightened safety protocols in light of covid19 and remote audits do not fully offset risks from the inability to conduct onsite audits in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents 

we may also suffer losses when our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations or when our or our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability claim or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales product inventory financial condition results of operations and cash flows and we could incur significant expense responding to such a claim 

we face risks related to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that we maintain effective control environment processes including in connection with our global shared services capability actions by our employees contractors or agents in violation of our policies and procedures could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations when litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arise out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows even if a claim is unsuccessful without merit or not pursued to completion the cost of responding to such a claim including expenses and management time could adversely affect us furthermore as a result of the covid19 pandemic there may be investigations legal claims or litigation against us relating to our actions or decisions in response to the pandemic 

we could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis as a result our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to adequately protecting our valuable intellectual property rights 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets recipes technology knowhow and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses and infringement of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition 

we may be unaware of potential thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products which could include removal of existing products from sale any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation brand health ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products product sales financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we face risks related to tax matters including changes in tax laws and rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes 

in december 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation “us tax reform” the legislation implements many new us domestic and international tax provisions the internal revenue service “irs” the us treasury department and numerous state governments issued additional guidance during 2018 2019 and 2020 we have factored the original 2017 legislation as well as the additional guidance into our 2017 through 2020 financial results of operations as applicable as of january 2021 there is a new president of the united states and his campaign included proposed changes to us tax legislation adoption of new us tax rules could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition tax legislation enacted by foreign jurisdictions could significantly affect our ongoing operations for example during the third quarter of 2019 swiss federal and zurich cantonal events took place that resulted in enacted tax law changes under us gaap “swiss tax reform” the new legislation is intended to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures we will continue to monitor swiss tax reform for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded further foreign tax authorities could impose rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting payments or subject us to new types of taxes such as digital taxes aspects of us tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision additionally changes in tax laws in the us or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax provision results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2020 we sold our products in over 150 countries and had operations in approximately 80 countries consequently a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders in addition movements in currency exchange rates affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries our efforts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions may not be successful we hedge a number of risks including exposures to foreign exchange rate movements and volatility of interest rates that could impact our future borrowing costs hedging of these risks could potentially subject us to counterparty credit risk in addition local economies monetary policies and currency hedging availability affect our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses we might not be able to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency risks due to factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty inflation and limited hedging opportunities accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect future demand for our products our financial condition results of operations and cash flows and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or longterm 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our shortand longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the 

table of contents 

liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry could affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates our participation in multiemployer pension plans and other factors could increase our costs relating to our employees’ pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for a number of our employees throughout the world and also contribute to other employees’ pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor at the end of 2020 the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was 135 billion and plan assets were 129 billion 

for defined benefit pension plans that we maintain the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate and government debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market value of plan assets affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and impact our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we will be required to make additional cash contributions to these companysponsored pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost 

we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain us unionrepresented employees as a participating employer under multiemployer pension plans we may owe more than the contributions we are required to make under the applicable collective bargaining agreements for example if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability such as the withdrawal liability we are paying in connection with our complete withdrawal from the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund in 2018 this kind of withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates see note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

recent developments and significant items affecting comparability 

covid19 

we have been actively monitoring the outbreak of covid19 and its impact globally our highest priorities continue to be the safety of our employees and working with our employees and network of suppliers and customers to help maintain the global food supply chain 

during 2020 we experienced a significant increase in demand and revenue growth in certain markets as consumers increased their food purchases for inhome consumption results were particularly strong in modern trade such as large grocery supermarkets and retail chains and ecommerce and especially for categories such as biscuits other parts of our business were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and other related restrictions including some of our emerging markets with a greater concentration of traditional trade such as small familyrun stores as well as our world travel retail such as international dutyfree stores and foodservice businesses during the second quarter especially lockdowns and other related measures or restrictions had a negative impact on emerging markets with a greater concentration of traditional trade due to store closures particularly in our latin america region as well as parts of our amea region as well as in categories like gum and candy which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home in the second half of the year demand grew in both developed and emerging markets as the negative impacts of covid19 during the second quarter subsided and a number of our key markets returned to higher growth a sharp reduction in global travel continues to negatively impact our world travel retail business and lower outofhome consumption continues to negatively impact our foodservice business as well as sales of our gum and candy products during 2020 we also experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging markets that were not material to our consolidated results we discuss these and other impacts of covid19 below 

our employees customers and communities 

we have taken a number of actions to promote the health and safety of our employees customers and consumers which is our first priority 

• we implemented enhanced protocols to provide a safe and sanitary working environment for our employees in many locations our employees are working remotely whenever possible for employees who are unable to work remotely we have adopted a number of heightened protocols consistent with those prescribed by the world health organization related to social distancing including staggering lunchtimes and shifts where possible and restricting inperson gatherings and nonessential travel and enhanced hygiene and workplace sanitation at a local level we have also provided additional flexibility and support to employees in our manufacturing facilities distribution and logistics operations and sales organization 

• we have been hiring frontline employees in the us and other locations to meet additional marketplace demand and promote uninterrupted functioning of our manufacturing distribution and sales network 

table of contents 

• we increased our 15 million global commitment to assist those most impacted by covid19 to approximately 28 million to date we have been supporting local and global organizations that are responding to food instability and providing emergency relief 

our supply chain and operations 

we operate in the food and beverages industry and are part of the global food supply chain one of our main objectives during the pandemic is to maintain the availability of our products to meet the needs of our consumers in response to increased demand we have increased production and to date we have not experienced material disruptions in our supply chain or operations 

• we were able to leverage learnings from our timely response to the initial outbreak in china and we put in place procedures across our supply chain to help mitigate the risk that our manufacturing sites will experience material closures or disruptions 

• we have been able to continue to source raw ingredients packaging energy and transportation and deliver our products to our customers 

• we have not experienced material disruptions in our workforce however mandatory and voluntary stayathome restrictions have resulted in increased levels of absenteeism 

• commodity costs have become more volatile due to the covid19 outbreak although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we anticipate continued commodity cost volatility as the pandemic continues 

• we have experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging markets the disruptions were not material to our consolidated results for 2020 in the future the ongoing covid19 outbreak could disrupt our global supply chain operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our comanufacturers or distributors these disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them could increase product or distribution costs prices and potentially affect the availability of our products 

• our 2020 net revenue and net earnings in us dollars were negatively affected by currency translation losses from a generally stronger us dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate 

• during the second quarter of 2020 we incurred higher operating costs primarily for labor customer service and logistics security personal protective equipment and cleaning in the second half of 2020 our spending in these areas was significantly less but still above precovid levels we continued to incur higher costs in these areas in response to the ongoing pandemic as we worked to protect our employees and deliver our products timely and safely to our customers most other aspects of our global supply chain and operations did not change materially during 2020 while we have not had material disruptions to date we do not know whether or how our supply chain or operations may be negatively affected if the pandemic persists for an extended period or worsens as we respond to this evolving situation we intend to continue to execute on our strategic operating plans however disruptions higher operating costs or uncertainties like those noted above could result in delays or modifications to our plans and initiatives 

our liquidity 

we believe the steps we have taken to enhance our capital structure and liquidity over the last several years and months have strengthened our ability to operate through current conditions 

• during 2019 we generated 40 billion of cash from operations or 30 billion after deducting capital expenditures 

• during 2020 we generated 40 billion of cash from operations or 31 billion after capital expenditures also as of december 31 2020 we had 36 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand 

• during 2020 we also received cash of €350 million 394 million from our participation in the jde peets public share offerings and 2094 million from our participation in the kdp secondary offering and subsequent kdp share sales see additional information below and in note 7 equity method investments  

• as a precautionary measure in march we also suspended our share repurchase program which was reinstated during our fourth quarter 

• in connection with various legislatively authorized tax payment deferral mechanisms available for income tax indirect tax such as valueadded tax and payroll tax in a number of jurisdictions we were able to defer certain of these tax payments which provided a cash benefit that reverses when the payments come due some of these payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2020 the remainder will come due in 2021 and 2022 the benefits associated with the deferral of these tax payments were not material to our financial statements 

table of contents 

• based on our current available cash and access to financing markets we do not anticipate any issue funding our next longterm debt maturities of approximately 15 billion in october 2021 and approximately 03 billion in december 2021 and after paying approximately 08 billion of maturing debt in january 2021 

• we also have access to shortterm and longterm financing markets and have actively utilized these markets in 2020 during the initial outbreak of covid19 in march we put supplemental shortterm credit facilities in place which we have since retired in full we also continued to utilize the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for flexible lowcost shortterm financing we also issued additional longterm debt several times in 2020 due to favorable market conditions and opportunities to shift a portion of our funding mix from shortterm debt to longterm debt at a low cost we continue to have 60 billion of undrawn credit facilities as well as other forms of shortterm and longterm financing options available refer to the liquidity and capital resources section and note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  we have been and we expect to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants 

our financial position 

• we evaluated the realizability of our assets and whether there are any impairment indicators we reviewed our receivables inventory rightofuse lease assets longlived assets equity method and other longterm investments deferred tax assets goodwill and intangible assets 

• in connection with the ongoing pandemic we identified a decline in demand for certain of our brands primarily in the gum category that prompted additional evaluation of our indefinitelife intangible assets during the second quarter of 2020 in addition to our annual testing in the third quarter of 2020 in connection with the testing we concluded that eight brands were impaired and we recorded 144 million of impairment charges in 2020 while we did not identify impairment triggers for other brands there continues to be significant uncertainty due to the pandemic if brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future refer to note 6 goodwill and intangible assets  for additional details on our intangible asset impairment evaluation 

• restructuring and implementation activities were in line with our simplify to grow program strategic objectives 

• our equity investments in jde peets and kdp give us additional financial flexibility 

• we will continue to monitor the quality of our assets and our overall financial position over coming quarters 

• we continue to maintain oversight over our core process controls through our centralized shared service model and our key controls are operating as designed 

while some of the initial impacts of the pandemic on our business moderated in the second half of 2020 the business and economic environment remains uncertain and additional impacts may arise that we cannot currently anticipate barring material business disruptions or other negative developments we expect to continue to meet the demand of consumers for our snacks food and beverage products however the elevated consumer demand we experienced primarily in some of our developed market countries in 2020 may not continue we are unable to predict how long this sustained demand will last or how significant it will be we expect the covid19 outbreak to result in lower revenues primarily in some of our emerging market countries that have a higher concentration of traditional trade outlets such as small familyrun stores our gum and candy categories which are more instant consumption in nature as well as our world travel retail such as international dutyfree stores and foodservice businesses as we continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving impacts of the pandemic we continue to communicate with and support our employees and customers monitor and take steps to further safeguard our supply chain operations technology and assets protect our liquidity and financial position work toward our strategic priorities and monitor our financial performance as we seek to position the company to withstand the current uncertainty related to this pandemic 

kdp and jde peets equity method investment transactions 

on july 9 2018 keurig green mountain inc keurig closed on its definitive merger agreement with dr pepper snapple group inc and formed keurig dr pepper inc nyse kdp a publicly traded company following the close of the transaction our 242 investment in keurig together with our shareholder loan receivable became a 138 investment in kdp during 2018 we recorded a pretax gain of 778 million or 586 million aftertax in connection with the kdp transaction in the third quarter of 2018 we changed our accounting principle to reflect our share of keurigs historical and kdps ongoing earnings on a onequarter lag basis for all periods presented while we continue to record dividends when cash is received 

during 2019 we recognized a 23 million pretax gain related to the impact of a kdp acquisition that decreased our ownership interest from 138 to 136 

table of contents

summary of results 

  

• net revenues were approximately 266 billion in 2020 and 259 billion in 2019 an increase of 28 in 2020 and a decrease of 03 in 2019 in 2020 net revenues were significantly impacted by the covid19 outbreak and response in developed markets particularly north america demand for our products primarily biscuits and chocolate grew significantly as consumers increased their food purchases for inhome consumption in some of our emerging markets where we have a greater concentration of traditional trade as well as in our gum and candy world travel retail and foodservice businesses where we sell products that are typically consumed away from home net revenues were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and other related restrictions in the second half of the year the negative impacts we experienced from covid19 particularly during the second quarter subsided resulting in a return to revenue growth across a number of our key markets 

– net revenue increased in 2020 driven by higher net pricing favorable volumemix and incremental net revenues from our acquisitions of give  go in 2020 and perfect snacks in 2019 these items were partially offset by the significant impact of unfavorable currency translation as the us dollar strengthened against most currencies in which we operate compared to exchange rates in the prior year as well as the may 28 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the middle east and africa 

– net revenue decreased in 2019 driven by the impact of unfavorable currency translation and the impact of the divestiture of most of our cheese business in the middle east and africa net revenues were positively affected by higher net pricing and favorable volumemix as well as our acquisitions of perfect snacks in 2019 and tates bake shop in 2018 

• organic net revenue increased 37 to 268 billion in 2020 and increased 41 to 269 billion in 2019 while organic net revenue in 2020 was impacted by the covid19 outbreak and response described above organic net revenue increased in both 2020 and 2019 due to higher net pricing and favorable volumemix organic net revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures we use organic net revenue as it provides improved yearoveryear comparability of our underlying operating results see the definition of organic net revenue and our reconciliation with net revenues within nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section 

• diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international decreased 82 to 247 in 2020 and increased 206 to 269 in 2019 

– diluted eps decreased in 2020 primarily driven by lapping the prioryear benefit from swiss tax reform costs associated with the jde peets transaction loss on debt extinguishment higher intangible asset impairment charges unfavorable yearoveryear marktomarket impacts from currency and commodity derivatives lapping a prioryear gain on divestiture lapping the prioryear benefit from pension participation changes and the unfavorable impact on net earnings from divestitures these factors were partially offset by gains on equity method investment transactions higher adjusted eps favorable change from the resolution of tax matters a benefit in 2020 as compared to an expense in 2019 lower simplify to grow program costs and lower losses related to interest rate swaps 

– diluted eps increased in 2019 primarily driven by the benefit from swiss tax reform lapping the prioryear impact from pension participation changes operating gains lower simplify to grow program costs an increase in equity method investment earnings lapping the prioryear loss on debt extinguishment fewer shares outstanding a gain on divestiture lower interest expense and a benefit from currentyear pension participation changes partially offset by lapping the prioryear gain on equity method investment transactions unfavorable currency translation a loss related to interest rate swaps the expense from the resolution of tax matters in 2019 and an unfavorable yearoveryear change in marktomarket impacts from currency and commodity derivatives see our discussion and analysis of historical results appearing later in this section for further details 

• adjusted eps increased 53 to 259 in 2020 and increased 42 to 246 in 2019 on a constant currency basis adjusted eps increased 65 to 262 in 2020 and increased 110 to 262 in 2019 

– for 2020 operating gains an increase in benefit plan nonservice income and fewer shares outstanding partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and a decrease in equity method investment earnings drove the adjusted eps growth 

– for 2019 operating gains increased equity method investment earnings fewer shares outstanding lower interest expense and lower taxes partially offset by unfavorable currency translation drove the adjusted eps growth

adjusted eps and adjusted eps on a constant currency basis are nongaap financial measures we use these measures as they provide improved yearoveryear comparability of our underlying results see the definition of adjusted eps and our reconciliation with diluted eps within nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section 

financial outlook 

we seek to achieve profitable longterm growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps we use these nongaap financial metrics and related computations particularly growth in profit dollars to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make nearand longterm operating and strategic decisions as such we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” financial results we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business we believe our nongaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results we have provided reconciliations between our gaap and nongaap financial measures in nongaap financial measures which appears later in this section 

in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives 

covid19 – we continue to monitor and respond to the covid19 outbreak while its full impact is not yet known it has had a material negative effect on economic conditions globally and could have a material negative effect on our business and results in the future particularly if there are significant adverse changes to consumer demand or significant disruptions to the supply production or distribution of our products or the credit or financial stability of our customers and other business partners an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may also have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts any of these and other developments could materially harm our business results of operations and financial condition we will continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and consumers as we manage operations during the pandemic we may continue to incur increased labor customer service logistics and other costs as consumer demand for our products evolves we could see continued shifts in product mix that could have a negative impact on our results as discussed in recent developments and significant items affecting comparability  we are working to mitigate any negative impacts to our business from the covid19 outbreak but we may not be able to fully predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near and longterm adverse impacts to our results 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products while gum and candy category growth was down due to less onthego consumption the overall snack category continued to grow in 2020 in part due to increased consumer demand for snacks purchases for inhome consumption during the covid19 outbreak as part of our strategic plan we seek to drive category growth by leveraging our local and consumerfocused commercial approach making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our availability across multiple channels we believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets our recent research underscores the growth of snacking worldwide and how behavior sentiment and routines surrounding food are being reshaped by covid19 snacking which was already increasing among consumers has accelerated further in 2020 as consumers spend more time at home according to the second annual state of snacking report commissioned by mondelēz international and issued in november 2020 the report was conducted in conjunction with consumer poll specialist the harris poll and summarizes the findings from interviews with thousands of consumers across 12 countries the report shows that consumers see snacking as an important source of comfort connection and community especially during the past year for many snacking offers moments of satisfaction and peace with a majority of respondents noting it has helped distract them from a challenging year

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations including in emerging markets some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business as further discussed in covid19 above and in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk volatility in global consumer commodity currency and capital markets increased significantly during 2020 and is expected to continue until the covid19 outbreak is largely resolved see also below for a discussion of brexit as well as argentina which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018 in addition the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in us trade programs trade relations regulations taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability to help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs including hedging and pricing as well as targeted investments in our brands and new routes to market 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a localfirst commercial focus new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives product innovation and high standards of product quality we also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

pricing – our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs we generally have increased prices in response to higher commodity costs currency and other market factors in 2021 we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing price changes may affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning to remain competitive on our operating structure we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability such as our simplify to grow program which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs 

taxes – we continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform during the third quarter of 2019 we recorded the impact of swiss tax reform and we will continue to monitor for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded in the united states while the 2017 us tax reform reduced the us corporate tax rate and included some beneficial provisions other provisions have and will continue to have an adverse effect on our results 

currency – as a global company with 732 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our nonus operations including the united kingdom we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results to partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currencydenominated debt crosscurrency swaps and other financial instruments while we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position see additional discussion of brexit and argentina below and refer also to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  and note 10 financial instruments  for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks as currency movements can make comparison of yearoveryear operating performance challenging we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis holding prioryear currency exchange rates constant so that prioryear and currentyear results can be compared on a consistent basis

brexit – on december 24 2020 the european union and the united kingdom reached an agreement on a new trade arrangement that became effective on january 1 2021 main trade provisions include the continuation of no tariffs or quotas on trade between the uk and eu so long as we meet prescribed trade terms we will also need to meet product and labeling standards for both the uk and eu and we have already begun to introduce these changes gradually the uk may also set its own trade policies with countries such as the united states australia and new zealand that currently do not have free trade agreements with the eu crossborder trade between the uk and eu will be subject to new customs regulations documentation and reviews to date we have not experienced significant delays at ukeu border crossings however we anticipate increased shipping costs and nearterm delays because of the need for ongoing customs inspections and related procedures our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods volatility in foreign currencies and other markets may also arise as the uk and eu work though the new trade arrangements once the new rules are formalized there could be other near or longterm negative impacts we have been taking protective measures to limit disruptions to our supply chain and sales to limit potential negative impacts on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we continue to increase our resources in customer service  logistics as well as in our factories and on our customs support teams we are adapting our systems and processes for new and increased customs transactions we continue to enhance resilience plans to aid in dealing with anticipated border delays we are working to address new regulatory requirements such as packaging changes also we continue to closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials packaging and finished goods in the uk any disagreements on trade terms or supply chain or distribution delays or other disruptions could negatively affect our uk business in 2020 we generated 90 of our net revenues in the uk 

argentina – as further discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting on july 1 2018 we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our argentinean subsidiaries as a result we recorded a remeasurement loss of 9 million in 2020 a remeasurement gain of 4 million in 2019 and a remeasurement loss of 11 million in 2018 within selling general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods the mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert argentinean pesos to us dollars could change over time so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings 

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lowcost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases we continued to secure lowcost short and longterm debt during 2020 we continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt we also enter into crosscurrency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge our nonus net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates our net investment hedge derivative contracts have had and are expected to have a favorable impact and reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  and note 10 financial instruments  for additional information on our debt and derivative activity 

cybersecurity risks – we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats while we have taken a number of security measures to protect our systems and data security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets  

we test goodwill and indefinitelife intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on july 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead in our quantitative testing we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for our europe and north america reporting units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 61 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america and amea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 91 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions based on available information given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of covid19 those estimates could be significantly different than future performance if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value 

in 2020 2019 and 2018 there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2020 annual impairment testing each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

annually we assess indefinitelife intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of these assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value we determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

during 2020 we recorded 144 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to eight brands we recorded charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy brands of 83 million in north america 53 million in europe 5 million in amea and 3 million in latin america the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we use several accepted valuation methods including relief of royalty excess earnings and excess margin that utilize estimates of future sales earnings growth rates royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brands global fair value we also identified nine brands including the eight impaired brands with 753 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2020 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less we continue to monitor our brand performance particularly in light of the significant uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic and related impacts to our business if the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future in 2019 we recorded charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy brands of 39 million in europe 15 million in amea and 3 million in latin america in 2018 we recorded charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy brands of 45 million in europe 14 million in north america and 9 million in amea

trade and marketing programs 

we promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs these programs include but are not limited to new product introduction fees discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives as well as cooperative advertising instore displays and consumer marketing promotions trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits for accounting purposes we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates expected returns on plan assets expected compensation increases employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality and health care cost trends we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses for plans that have assets held in trust the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2020 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease on our annual benefit plan costs 



in accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements we participate in multiemployer pension plans in 2017 the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund our obligation to contribute to the fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the bakery confectionery tobacco and grain millers union all of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016 in 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the fund and recorded a 429 million estimated withdrawal liability on july 11 2019 we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the fund totaling 526 million requiring prorata monthly payments over 20 years and we recorded a 35 million final adjustment to reduce our

withdrawal liability as of june 30 2019 we began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019 as of december 31 2020 the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was 375 million

income taxes 

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities whether by settlement with tax authorities judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made 

see note 16 income taxes  for further discussion of the impacts from swiss and us tax reform in our financial statements as well as additional information on our effective tax rate current and deferred taxes valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our revolving credit facilities shortterm borrowings and our authorized longterm financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions share repurchases and quarterly dividends in light of the current uncertainty in the global markets related to the covid19 pandemic however an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets could also impair our banking and other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts any of these and other developments could materially harm our access to capital or financial condition as a precautionary measure and to preserve financial flexibility we temporarily increased our credit facility borrowing capacity in 2020 in the third quarter of 2020 we completed the retirement of this incremental shortterm borrowing capacity and have returned our credit facility available capacity to precovid19 levels refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  for additional details in connection with covid19 and various legislatively authorized tax payment deferral mechanisms available for income tax indirect tax such as valueadded tax and payroll tax in a number of jurisdictions we were able to defer certain of these tax payments which provided a cash benefit that reverses when the payments come due some of these payments were made in the fourth quarter of 2020 the remainder will come due in 2021 and 2022 the benefits associated with the deferral of these payments were not material we expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed and we secured and continue to evaluate longterm debt issuances to meet our short and longerterm funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity however if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 3964 million in 2020 3965 million in 2019 and 3948 million in 2018 net cash provided by operating activities was largely flat in 2020 relative to 2019 as higher cash tax payments in 2020 primarily related to sales of kdp and jde peets shares and the resolution of several indirect tax matters under a tax amnesty program in india and the payment of costs associated with the jde peets transaction in 2020 were largely offset by working capital improvements the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was due primarily to higher earnings increased distributions from equity method investments and lower pension contributions partially offset by increased working capital requirements including higher tax payments 

net cash provided byused in investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 500 million in 2020 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 960 million in 2019 and 1224 million in 2018 the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to cash received from the sale of shares in the jde peets and kdp offerings and lower capital expenditures partially offset by cash paid to acquire a majority interest in give  go the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to less cash expended for acquisitions in 2019 than in 2018 lower capital expenditures and the 2019 cash proceeds from the divestiture of primarily our cheese business in the middle east and africa partially offset by lower cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts and cash paid to settle our forwardstarting interest rate swaps 

capital expenditures were 863 million in 2020 925 million in 2019 and 1095 million in 2018 we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2021 capital expenditures to be up to 10 billion including capital expenditures in connection with our simplify to grow program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 2215 million in 2020 2787 million in 2019 and 2329 million in 2018 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2020 relative to 2019 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020 the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividends paid in 2019 partially offset by lower share repurchases

debt 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  for details of our recent tender offers debt issuances and maturities the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors due to seasonality in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital or other financing needs 

one of our subsidiaries mondelez international holdings netherlands bv “mihn” has outstanding debt refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  the operations held by mihn generated approximately 718 or 191 billion of the 266 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2020 and represented approximately 762 or 211 billion of the 277 billion of net assets as of december 31 2020 

during december 2020 our board of directors approved a new 60 billion longterm financing authority to replace the prior 80 billion authority as of december 31 2020 we had 60 billion of longterm financing authority remaining 

in january 2021 we repaid approximately 08 billion of maturing debt in the next 12 months we expect to repay approximately 18 billion of maturing longterm debt including 15 billion in october 2021 and 03 billion in december 2021 we expect to fund these repayments with cash on hand as well as shortterm and longterm debt 

our total debt was 200 billion at december 31 2020 and 184 billion at december 31 2019 our debttocapitalization ratio was 042 at december 31 2020 and 040 at december 31 2019 at december 31 2020 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 74 years our average daily commercial borrowings were 23 billion in 2020 41 billion in 2019 and 45 billion in 2018 we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december 31 2020 and 26 billion outstanding as of december 31 2019 we expect to continue to use cash or commercial paper to finance various shortterm financing needs as of december 31 2020 we continued to be in compliance with our debt covenants refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  for more information on our debt and debt covenants 

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production during 2020 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials as well as increased costs for cocoa dairy sugar energy packaging nuts grains and other ingredients costs partially offset by lower costs for oils 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes such as dairy where there is a limited ability to hedge and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2021 while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we use nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have detailed the nongaap adjustments that we make in our nongaap definitions below the adjustments generally fall within the following categories acquisition  divestiture activities gains and losses on intangible asset sales and noncash impairments major program restructuring activities constant currency and related adjustments major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results we believe the nongaap measures should always be considered along with the related us gaap financial measures we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and nongaap financial measures below and we also discuss our underlying gaap results throughout our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k 

our primary nongaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prioryear operating results as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change when our definitions change we provide the updated definitions and present the related nongaap historical results on a comparable basis 1  

• “organic net revenue” is defined as net revenues excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures 2 and currency rate fluctuations 3  we also evaluate organic net revenue growth from emerging and developed markets

1 when items no longer impact our current or future presentation of nongaap operating results we remove these items from our nongaap definitions during 2020 we added to the nongaap definitions the exclusion of costs associated with the jde peets transaction refer to note 7 equity method investments  and note 16 income taxes  for more information on the jde peets transaction 

2 divestitures include completed sales of businesses including the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement as we record our share of kdp and jde peet’s ongoing earnings on a onequarter lag basis any kdp or jde peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our nongaap results the following quarter see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  and note 7 equity method investments for information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results

6 during the third quarter of 2016 we began to exclude unrealized gains and losses marktomarket impacts from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives from our nongaap earnings measures until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods we made this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods we also discontinued designating commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives for hedge accounting treatment to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating results we have recast all historical nongaap earnings measures to exclude the marktomarket impacts

9 the impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation we exclude these charges from our non–gaap results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations see note 11 benefit plans  for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal 

10 we exclude the impact of the 2019 swiss tax reform and 2017 us tax reform during the third quarter of 2019 swiss federal and zurich cantonal tax events drove our recognition of a swiss tax reform net benefit to our results of operations on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions we exclude these tax reform impacts from our adjusted eps as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the new tax reforms refer to note 16 income taxes  for more information on our current year estimated annual effective tax rate and swiss and us tax reform 

11 we have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ significant operating and nonoperating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs restructuring program costs and discrete us tax reform impacts in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and nonoperating items each reporting period we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control our gaap “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ significant operating and nonoperating items 

we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures vary among companies the nongaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results 

during 2020 the covid19 pandemic and related global response significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world national and local governments imposed preventative or protective restrictions on travel and business operations and advised or required citizens to remain at home temporary closures of businesses were ordered and numerous other businesses temporarily closed voluntarily the impact of the global pandemic and response has had a material unfavorable impact on global markets including commodity currency and capital markets while some of these markets such as the us and other major stock markets and certain currencies have rebounded significantly in the second and third quarters of 2020 these markets are likely to continue to remain volatile while the situation continues an economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed a disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties for a number of our derivative contracts we are actively working to mitigate these risks and we largely employed existing strategies that are described below to mitigate these market risks related to currency commodity and interest rate risks 

we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 10 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by operating segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results throughout our discussion and analysis of results we isolate currency impacts and supplementally provide net revenues operating income and diluted earnings per share on a constant currency basis for additional information on the impact of currency policies recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions such as the current covid19 pandemic to manage input cost volatility we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings 

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to london interbank offered rates “libor” the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom plans to phase out libor by the end of 2021 we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of libor given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions for more information on our 2020 debt activity see note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  

see note 10 financial instruments  for more information on our derivative activity

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2020 and 2019 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

  



this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

strategy 

we aim to be the global leader in snacking by focusing on growth execution and culture in 2019 we began to operate under a new strategic plan that builds on our strong foundations including our unique portfolio of iconic global and local brands our attractive global footprint our market leadership in developed and emerging markets our deep innovation marketing and distribution capabilities and our margin expansion in recent years that allows us to make ongoing investments in our product portfolio

we run our business with a longterm perspective and we believe the successful delivery of our strategic plan will drive top and bottomline growth and enable us to create longterm value for our shareholders 

operating segments 

our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments 

 

we manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets our regional management teams have responsibility for the business product categories and financial results in the regions 

we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends for a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pretax earnings as well as other information on our segments see note 18 segment reporting  

our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were 



our segment operating income for each of the last three years was 



please see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for items affecting the comparability of results and a review of our operating results 

our brands span five product categories 

 

during 2019  our segments contributed to our net revenues in the following product categories 



within our product categories classes of products that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net revenues were 



divestitures and acquisitions 

for information on divestitures and acquisitions that impacted our results please refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions  

customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2019  our five largest customers accounted for 170 and our ten largest customers accounted for 232 of net revenues from continuing operations in 2019  

seasonality 

demand for our products is generally balanced over the second and third quarters of the year and increases in the first and fourth quarters primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events depending on when easter falls easter holiday sales may shift between the first and second quarter we build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material funding for working capital items including inventory and receivables is normally sourced from operating cash flows and shortterm commercial paper borrowings for additional information on our liquidity working capital management cash flow and financing activities see liquidity and capital resources  note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  appearing later in this 10k filing 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience nutritional value the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of digital and other sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures we believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position 

distribution and marketing 

we generally sell our products to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

through our global ecommerce organization and capabilities we pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world including both pure etailers and brickandmortar retailers we continue to invest in both talent and digital capabilities our ecommerce channel strategies will play a critical role in our ambition to be the best snacking company in the world 

we conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing and advertising including onair print outdoor digital and social media and other product promotions ii consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can sustainably and costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production 

a number of external factors such as changing weather patterns and conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

due to factors noted above the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate at this time we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources however we continue to monitor the longterm impacts of climate change and related factors that could affect the availability or cost of raw materials packaging and energy for additional information on our commodity costs refer to the commodity trends section within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information on our ongoing sustainability efforts and programs refer to sustainability and wellbeing below 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights including trademarks patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets technology and knowhow are material to our business 

we own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world depending on the country trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms we also have patents for a number of current and potential products our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks patents andor proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture sale or distribution of third party products similarly we sell some products under brands patents andor proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties in our agreement with kraft foods group inc which is now part of the kraft heinz company we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spinoff of our north american grocery business 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development food safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced production costs our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends wellbeing and sustainability are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives these initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging scalable innovation platforms sustainability programs and initiatives as well as breakthrough technologies in 2019 we completed a 65 million plan to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities we modernized our technical center facilities at suzhou china jurong singapore and thane india in 2018 in 2019 we also completed the modernization of technical centers in curitiba brazil and mexico city mexico in addition we have invested in the pasuruan cocoa technology centre in indonesia which is scheduled to fully open in 2020 we are focusing our technical resources at twelve key locations to drive growth and innovation our network of technical centers enable greater effectiveness improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery these locations are in curitiba brazil suzhou china thane india pasuruan indonesia mexico city mexico east hanover new jersey wroclaw poland jurong singapore bournville united kingdom reading united kingdom saclay france and munich germany 

at december 31 2019  within our global research development  quality services area we had approximately 2400 scientists engineers and other personnel of which 1900 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs our research and development expense was 351 million in 2019  362 million in 2018 and 366 million in 2017  

regulation 

our food products and ingredients are subject to local national and multinational regulations related to labeling health and nutrition claims packaging pricing marketing and advertising data privacy and related areas in addition various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities enforcing standards for select food products grading food products and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention these policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review in addition increased attention to environmental issues in industry supply chains has led to developing different types of regulation in many countries the lack of a harmonized approach can lead to uneven scrutiny or enforcement which can impact our operations 

examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes labeling requirements such as frontofpack labeling and nutrient profiling media and marketing restrictions such as restrictions on advertising products with specified nutrition profiles on certain channels or platforms or during certain hours of the day potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials and extended producer responsibility fees and packaging taxes we will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with existing laws and regulations will be material also refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  for additional information on government regulations and currencyrelated impacts on our operations in the united kingdom argentina and other countries 

environmental regulation 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act we track regulatory developments in various jurisdictions relating to the use of plastic in packaging materials and taxes linked to the costs of waste so that we can comply with evolving requirements we believe that our compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

sustainability and wellbeing 

our 2025 sustainable snacking strategy provides a clear roadmap which we believe puts us at the forefront of sustainable ingredient sourcing and continuing to contribute to addressing climate change by reducing emissions we are focused on making our snacks with less energy water and waste with ingredients consumers know and trust we have specific goals to which we hold ourselves accountable and we are continuing to make progress in our efforts to deliver meaningful change 

we are proud of the progress we achieved to date and excited about where we are going by living our purpose to empower people to snack right we believe we can continue to have a positive impact on the lives of our consumers and the world around us we have been focused on sustainability for many years and we continue to enhance and evolve our sustainability goals and reporting we will issue our 2019 snacking made right report which will include our progress toward our sustainability goals later this year 

our 2025 sustainability and mindful snacking goals include 

 

our 2025 sustainability goals are designed to make a meaningful impact on how we address climate change and are based on an endtoend sciencebased approach to reducing our carbon footprint including reducing our absolute co 2 emissions from manufacturing and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains we are also working to cut our absolute water footprint in manufacturing focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce we continue to work on reducing waste in manufacturing and packaging 

in ingredient sourcing we continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes focusing where we can make the greatest impact for example we launched our cocoa life program in 2012 and are investing up to 400 million through 2022 to build a sustainable cocoa supply we are also improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in north america and through our harmony program in europe 

we are focused on consumer wellbeing our mindful snacking strategy aligns with our purpose to empower people to snack right continuing to evolve our portfolio so that we are offering a broad range of highquality snacks to meet consumers expanding needs is central to our strategy of accelerating our growth at the same time we are working to empower and encourage consumers to snack mindfully with portion control offerings and labeling expanding our portion control options – snacks that are 200 calories or less and are individually wrapped – enables people to enjoy the treats they love become more mindful about what they eat and manage their daily calorie intake 

the governance membership and public affairs committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our sustainable snacking and mindful snacking strategies our goals are part of our strategic planning process and therefore progress and key activities are regularly reported to the board of directors and the business leadership teams climate change co 2 emissions energy wellbeing and other sustainability matters are key focus areas in our strategy 

we have a robust enterprise risk management erm process for identifying measuring monitoring and managing risks with oversight by the risk and compliance committee mrcc which reports annually to the audit committee of our board of directors the purpose of the mrcc is to oversee how we identify and assess the most significant inherent risks to our business so we may adequately mitigate them or monitor them across the company all identified risks are vetted by the mrcc and remain under the mrcc’s governance ownership of specific risks is assigned at the mondelēz leadership team mlt level mlt members report directly to the ceo as owners of each specific risk mlt members are responsible for verifying that appropriate mitigation controls and monitoring systems are in place the risk universe considered during this process is wide and varied climate change is included in this risk universe as well as other sustainability and wellbeing issues 

our erm methodology is governed by the mrcc and includes annual reviews with our four operating regions considering companylevel risks by using information gathered at the asset level regions countries individual facilities and separate business units the following key risk drivers for climate change sustainability and wellbeing risks are captured in the erm framework a sustainability mindset within the organization and suppliers governance and monitoring of the sustainability agenda monitoring climate change impact assessing reputation and brand image the wellbeing portfolio and marketing strategy changes in regulations and changes in consumer preferences 

in addition we work with internal and external experts to review the impact of major societal issues on our business and to shape our strategic responses to them materials and processes that guide our assessment include our erm process analysis of stakeholder and regulatory issues our total greenhouse gas land and water footprint proprietary consumer insight data and publicly available data on societal issues including statistics and reports from authorities nongovernmental organizations and peer companies 

we have been recognized for our ongoing economic environmental and social contributions each year since we created mondelēz international in 2012 we have been listed on the dow jones sustainability index “djsi” – world and north american indices the djsi selects the top 10 of global companies and top 20 of north american companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry we are at the 95th percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in the areas of health  nutrition and addressing waterrelated risks

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business operating results liquidity and financial condition while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and we face risks related to the execution of our strategy and our timely response to pricing and other competitive pressures 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include food snack and beverage companies that operate in multiple geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies failure to effectively respond to challenges from our competitors could adversely affect our business 

competitor and customer pressures require that we timely and effectively respond to new distribution channels and technological developments and may require that we reduce our prices these pressures also affect our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively and timely assess new or developing trends technological advancements or changes in distribution methods and set proper pricing or effective trade incentives will negatively impact our operating results achievement of our strategic and financial goals and our ability to capitalize on new revenue or valueproducing opportunities the rapid evolution of new distribution channels in particular in ecommerce may disrupt our current operations or strategies more quickly than we planned for create consumer price deflation alter the buying behavior of consumers or disrupt our retail customer relationships we may need to increase or reallocate spending on existing and new distribution channels and technologies marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase revenues market share and brand significance these expenditures may not be successful including those related to our ecommerce and other technologyfocused efforts and might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations these new distribution channels as well as growing opportunities to utilize external manufacturers allow smaller competitors to more effectively gain market share additionally if we reduce prices but cannot increase sales volumes or our labor or other costs increase but we cannot increase prices to offset those changes our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

during 2019 we operated under our new strategy which focuses on accelerating consumercentric and volumedriven growth operational excellence driven by cost discipline and continuous operational improvement including in areas like sales execution and building a winning growth culture with a “local first” commercial approach failure to achieve these objectives or effectively operate under our strategy in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

promoting and protecting our reputation and brand image and health is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands expand to new geographies and new distribution platforms including ecommerce and evolve our portfolio with new product offerings that meet consumer expectations 

we seek to strengthen our brands through investments in our product quality product renovation innovation and marketing investments including consumerrelevant advertising digital transformation and consumer promotions failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on consumercentric wellbeing including changing consumer acceptance of certain ingredients nutritional expectations of our products and the sustainability of our ingredients our supply chain and our packaging could adversely affect our brands increased attention from the media governments shareholders and other stakeholders in these areas as well as on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image undue caution or inaction on our part in addressing these challenges and trends could weaken our competitive position such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations industry selfregulation that is unevenly adopted among companies and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our labeling advertising and consumer promotions or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity regulatory developments or legal action against us our employees or our licensees related to product quality and safety where and how we manufacture our products environmental risks human and workplace rights 

across our supply chain or antitrust antibribery and anticorruption compliance could damage our reputation and brand health such actions could undermine our customers’ and shareholders’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations our product sponsorship relationships including those with celebrity spokespersons influencers or group affiliations could also subject us to negative publicity 

in addition our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on established and emerging social media and online platforms digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns targeted marketing and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions limit how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our brand renovation innovation marketing and promotion plans particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about mondelēz international our brands or our employees on social media or web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media accounts and failure to respond effectively to these posts comments or activities could damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate our brands may be associated with or appear alongside harmful content before these platforms or our own social media monitoring can detect this risk to our brand health in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brands our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results and we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill furthermore third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks when consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future which could harm our brand image and sales failure to successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health could materially and adversely affect our company and product brands as well as our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new and improved products that meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences in the places and ways consumers want to shop there may be further shifts in the relative size of shopping channels in addition to the increasing role of ecommerce for consumers our success relies upon managing this complexity to promote and bring our products to consumers effectively moreover weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other factors such as severe or unusual weather events can affect consumer preferences and demand failure to offer products that appeal to consumers or to correctly judge consumer demand for our products will impact our ability to meet our growth targets and our sales and market share could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads and trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences when we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences or category trends will be longterm or fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy changing preferences our sales can be adversely affected in addition because of our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must be responsive to local consumer needs including with respect to when and how consumers snack and their desire for premium or value offerings provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences and use datadriven marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message failure to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories or reach consumers in efficient and effective ways leveraging data and analytics could cause demand for our products to decrease and our profitability to suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health environmental and social implications of certain food products ingredients packaging materials sourcing or production methods could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers have increasingly focused on wellbeing including reducing sodium and added sugar consumption as well as the source and authenticity of the foods they consume continuing to expand our wellbeing offerings and refining the ingredient and nutrition profiles of existing products is important to our growth as is maintaining focus on ethical sourcing and supply chain management opportunities to address evolving consumer preferences in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and 

social expectations continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 744 of our 2019 net revenues 753 of our 2018 net revenues and 758 of our 2017 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in over 150 countries and have operations in approximately 80 countries therefore we are subject to risks inherent in global operations those risks include   

 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war government shutdowns travel or immigration restrictions public health risks or pandemics public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties including inaccuracies in our assumptions about these factors could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand high unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the united kingdom’s planned exit from the european union “brexit” could have a negative effect on our business see below and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial outlook for more information on brexit 

all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or long term 

we face risks related to tax matters including changes in tax laws and rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes 

in december 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation “us tax reform” the legislation implements many new us domestic and international tax provisions while additional guidance has been issued by the internal revenue service “irs” and the us treasury department during 2018 and 2019 there are still some areas that need to be clarified also a number of us states have not updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation as a result there may be further impact of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition changes in us tax law including further interpretations of the 2017 us tax reform could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition tax legislation enacted by foreign jurisdictions could significantly affect our ongoing operations for example during the third quarter of 2019 swiss federal and zurich cantonal events took place that resulted in enacted tax law changes under us gaap “swiss tax reform” the new legislation is intended to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures we will continue to monitor swiss tax reform for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded further foreign tax authorities could impose rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting payments or subject us to new types of taxes such as digital taxes aspects of us tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision additionally changes in tax laws in the us or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax provision and our results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including among others brazil china india mexico russia argentina the middle east africa southeast asia and ukraine however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries particularly those with emerging economies engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws may be more common these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and lowcost local manufacturers improve and expand their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy failure to successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our use of information technology and thirdparty service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions 

we use information technology and thirdparty service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations such as manufacturing and distribution communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls executing mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services important to conducting our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware including the june 2017 malware incident that affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks the “malware incident” see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – recent developments and significant items affecting comparability – malware incident and – financial outlook – cybersecurity risks  other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security power outages hardware or software failures denial of service attacks telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences our use of new and emerging technologies such as cloudbased services and mobile applications continues to 

evolve presenting new and additional risks in managing access to our data relying on thirdparties to manage and safeguard data ensuring access to our systems and availability of thirdparty systems 

cybersecurity breaches of our or thirdparty systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks such as hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various thirdparty service providers and for thirdparty service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might increase challenges and costs to resolve related issues additionally new initiatives such as those related to ecommerce and direct sales that increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain increase our potential exposure from a cybersecurity breach if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our thirdparty providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data such as advanced email protection to reduce the likelihood of credential thefts and electronic fraud attempts we also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on the updated threat however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis due to the constantly evolving and complex nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly 

we regularly transfer data across national borders to conduct our operations and we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which has greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of european union law and became effective in may 2018 adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance of up to 4 of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which became effective on january 1 2020 imposes new responsibilities on us for the handling disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in california the ccpa permits california to assess potentially significant fines for violating ccpa and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations our efforts to comply with gdpr ccpa and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

we are subject to risks from unanticipated business disruptions 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we utilize an integrated supply chain  a complex network of suppliers and material needs owned and leased manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks shared service delivery centers and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters water availability supply and commodity shortages terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches generalized labor unrest government shutdowns or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our comanufacturers or distributors failure to effectively plan for and respond to disruptions in our operations for example by not finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations or by not quickly repairing damage to our information production or supply systems can cause delays in delivering or the inability to deliver products to our customers as we experienced in connection with the malware incident see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – recent developments and significant items affecting comparability – malware incident and – financial outlook – cybersecurity risks  and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected the occurrence of a 

material or extended disruption may cause us to lose our customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition we are subject to risk related to our own execution this includes risk of disruption caused by operational error including fire explosion or accidental contamination as well as our inability to achieve our strategic objectives due to capability or technology deficiencies related to our ongoing reconfiguration of our supply chain to drive efficiencies and fuel growth further our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity significant changes in trade policies changes in volume produced and changes to regulatory restrictions or laborrelated or other constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2019  we sold our products in over 150 countries and had operations in approximately 80 countries consequently a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders in addition movements in currency exchange rates affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries our efforts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions may not be successful we hedge a number of risks including exposures to foreign exchange rate movements and volatility of interest rates that could impact our future borrowing costs hedging of these risks could potentially subject us to counterparty credit risk in addition local economies monetary policies and currency hedging availability affect our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses we might not be able to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency risks due to factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty inflation and limited hedging opportunities accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect future demand for our products our financial condition and results of operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or longterm 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of product packaging materials natural gas fuel and electricity for our factories and warehouses and we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products costs of raw materials other supplies and services and energy are volatile and fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations geopolitical conditions or conflicts tariffs or other trade barriers government intervention to introduce living income premiums or similar requirements such as those announced in 2019 in two cocoagrowing countries severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics forest fires consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade policy and regulations alternative energy and agricultural programs increased government intervention and consumer or activist responses caused by increased focus on climate change deforestation water plastic waste animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business some commodities are grown by smallholder farmers who might not be able to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products including increases to cover higher input packaging and transportation costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities including necessary services such as transportation may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our 

prices or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints our financial condition and results of operations can be materially adversely affected 

we face risks related to complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate 

our activities around the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production packaging and waste management storage distribution sales advertising labeling and marketing as well as intellectual property competition antitrust trade labor tax and environmental matters privacy data protection and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations as well as their interpretations of existing laws and regulations our failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or to make changes necessary to comply with new or revised laws and regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations for instance our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in taxation and trade relations among the united states and other countries including a new united statesmexicocanada agreement when ratified developments in us trade relations with china or changes with or in the european union such as brexit 

we continue to monitor brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition in 2019 we generated 86 of our net revenues in the united kingdom and our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods volatility in foreign currencies and other markets is expected to continue as the united kingdom executes its exit from the european union if the uks membership in the european union terminates without trade and other crossborder operating agreements there could be increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and other countries including those in the european union shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods the united kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete if the ultimate terms of the uk’s separation from the european union negatively impact the uk economy or result in disruptions to sales or our supply chain the imposition of tariffs or currency devaluation in the united kingdom the impact to our consolidated revenue earnings and cash flow could be material see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial outlook – brexit for more information 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel with a variety of capabilities in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned or increased turnover of employees with key capabilities failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as ecommerce and digital marketing skills or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or to hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness changes in our operating model and business processes including building a winning growth culture implementing our “local first” commercial approach utilizing our global shared services capability and reconfiguring our supply chain could lead to operational challenges and changes in the skills we require to achieve our business goals failure to achieve a more diverse workforce and leadership team compensate our employees competitively and fairly or maintain a safe and inclusive environment could affect our reputation and also result in lower performance and an inability to retain valuable employees 

we might be unable to manage appropriately changes in or that affect our workforce or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 63 of our 68000 employees outside the united states and approximately 27 of our 12000 us employees strikes work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers or distributors or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements that expired in february 2016 and that cover eight us facilities could cause disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing or distribution processes changes in immigration laws and policies including in connection with brexit could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets discounters ecommerce merchants warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and other major markets continue to consolidate form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market resulting in fewer larger customers large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or longer payment terms retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels the emergence of alternative online retail channels such as direct to consumer and ebusiness to business may adversely affect our relationships with our large retail and wholesale customers 

in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products when they perceive little difference between the quality or value of our products and those of retailer or other economy brands when consumers prefer or otherwise choose to purchase the retailer or other economy brands we can lose market share or sales volumes or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

failure to effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers suppliers and distributors 

during 2019  our five largest customers accounted for 170 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disputes with significant suppliers or distributors including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply or deliver products to our customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations in addition the financial condition of our significant customers suppliers and distributors are affected by events that are largely beyond our control deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers suppliers or distributors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed deliberate or unintentional product contamination including contamination of ingredients we use in our products that third parties supply spoilage or other adulteration product mislabeling or product tampering in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses when our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations or when our or our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could 

face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales product inventory financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks related to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations however there can be no assurance that we maintain effective control environment processes including in connection with our global shared services capability actions by our employees contractors or agents in violation of our policies and procedures could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations when litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arise out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

climate change might adversely impact our supply chain or our operations 

scientific evidence collected by the intergovernmental panel on climate change demonstrates that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe these changes are expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters and affect water availability and quality these impacts increase risks for the global food production and distribution system decreased agricultural productivity caused by climate change might limit the availability of the commodities we purchase and use these include cocoa which is a critical raw material for our chocolate and biscuit portfolios that is particularly sensitive to changes in climate as well as other raw materials such as wheat vegetable oils sugar nuts and dairy localized weather events such as floods severe storms or water shortages that are partially caused or exacerbated by climate change might disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our comanufacturers or distributors 

concern about climate change might result in new legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change these changes could increase our operating costs for things like energy through taxes or regulations concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to switch away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact furthermore we might fail to effectively address increased attention from the media shareholders activists and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability matters including deforestation land use water use and packaging including plastic finally the fact that consumers are exposed to rising temperatures could affect demand for our products such as decreased demand we have experienced for chocolate during periods when temperatures are warmer 

taken together these risks could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet the needs of our customers reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners in addition execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate as appropriate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and similar strategic alliances pose additional risks as we share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time who may not have the same priorities strategies or resources as we do or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own strategic alliances we have entered into include our investments in jacobs douwe egberts and keurig dr pepper inc transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and nonfinancial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits depending on the nature of the business ventures including whether they operate globally these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are including political economic regulatory and compliance risks currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility of commodity and other input prices either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected 

furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis as a result our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our shortand longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry could affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates our participation in multiemployer pension plans and other factors could increase our costs relating to our employees’ pensions 

we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for a number of our employees throughout the world and also contribute to other employees’ pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor at the end of 2019  the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was 122 billion and plan assets were 115 billion  

for defined benefit pension plans that we maintain the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate and government debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market value of plan assets affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and impact our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we will be required to make additional cash contributions to these companysponsored pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost 

we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain us unionrepresented employees as a participating employer under multiemployer pension plans we may owe more than the contributions we are required to make under the applicable collective bargaining agreements for example if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability this withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates in 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund the fund and recorded a 429 million estimated withdrawal liability on july 11 2019 we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the fund totaling 526 million requiring prorata monthly payments over 20 years and we recorded a 35 million final adjustment to reduce our withdrawal liability as of june 30 2019 we began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019 as of december 31 2019  the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was 391 million  with 14 million recorded in other current liabilities and 377 million recorded in longterm other liabilities see note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we face risks related to adequately protecting our valuable intellectual property rights 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses and infringement of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business and financial condition 

we may be unaware of potential thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products which could include removal of existing products from sale any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation brand health ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products product sales financial condition and results of operations

recent developments and significant items affecting comparability 

swiss and us tax reform 

on august 6 2019 switzerland published changes to its federal tax law in the official federal collection of laws on september 27 2019 the zurich canton published their decision on the september 1 2019 zurich canton public vote regarding the cantonal changes associated with the swiss federal tax law change the intent of these tax law changes was to replace certain preferential tax regimes with a new set of internationally accepted measures that are hereafter referred to as “swiss tax reform” based on these federal  cantonal events our position is the enactment of swiss tax reform for us gaap purposes was met as of september 30 2019 and we recorded the impacts in the third quarter 2019 the net impact was a benefit of 767 million which consisted of a 769 million reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed stepup of intangible assets for tax purposes and remeasurement of our deferred tax balances partially offset by a 2 million indirect tax impact in selling general and administrative expenses the future rate impacts of these swiss tax reform law changes are effective starting january 1 2020 we will continue to monitor swiss tax reform for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation us tax reform that included a broad range of business tax provisions including but not limited to a reduction in the us federal tax rate from 35 to 21 as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits the legislation causes certain us allocated expenses eg interest and general administrative expenses to be taxed and imposes a tax on us crossborder payments furthermore the legislation included a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits while clarifying guidance was issued by the us treasury department and internal revenue service irs during 2018 and 2019 we continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance on implementing the legislation becomes available the impact of adopting the new provisions was a discrete net tax expense of 5 million in 2019 and 19 million in 2018 and a discrete net tax benefit of 44 million in 2017 

refer to note 16 income taxes  for more information on our annual effective tax rates and swiss and us tax reform 

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal 

in the united states we contribute to multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from our collective 

bargaining agreements the most individually significant multiemployer plan we participated in prior to the second quarter of 2018 was the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund the fund our obligation to contribute to the fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the bakery confectionery tobacco and grain millers union bctgm all of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016 and we continued to contribute to the fund through 2018 

in 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the fund and recorded a 429 million estimated withdrawal liability on july 11 2019 we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the fund totaling 526 million requiring prorata monthly payments over 20 years and we recorded a 35 million final adjustment to reduce our withdrawal liability as of june 30 2019 we began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019 as of december 31 2019  the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was 391 million  with 14 million recorded in other current liabilities and 377 million recorded in longterm other liabilities 

adoption of new lease accounting standard 

as further described in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  we adopted the new lease accounting standard on january 1 2019 the impact of adopting the standard included the initial recognition as of january 1 2019 of 710 million of leaserelated assets and 730 million of leaserelated liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet the transition method we elected for adoption required a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 2019 which was not material for additional information on leases refer to note 5 leases  

keurig dr pepper transaction

malware incident 

on june 27 2017 a global malware incident impacted our business the malware affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks following the incident we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact minimize damages and restore our systems environment we also restored our main operating systems and processes and enhanced our system security to date we have not found nor do we expect to find any instances of company or personal data released externally 

during 2017 we estimated the malware incident had a negative impact of 04 on our net revenue and organic net revenue growth as we recognized the majority of delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter 2017 results and we also permanently lost some revenue we incurred total incremental expenses of 84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort the recovery from the incident was largely resolved by the end of 2017 and we continued efforts to strengthen our security measures and enhance general information technology business process and disclosure controls 

summary of results 

  

 

 

 

 

financial outlook 

we seek to achieve profitable longterm growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps we use these nongaap financial metrics and related computations particularly growth in profit dollars to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make nearand longterm operating and strategic decisions as such we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” financial results we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business we believe our nongaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results we have provided reconciliations between our gaap and nongaap financial measures in nongaap financial measures which appears later in this section 

in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets snacking behavior is on the rise around the world according to the first annual “state of snacking” report commissioned by mondelēz international and issued in november 2019 which summarizes the findings from interviews with thousands of consumers across 12 countries a majority of adults and an even higher percentage of millennial consumers indicated they prefer to eat small bites throughout the day as opposed to larger meals the report concludes that consumer needs are evolving in response to busy modern lifestyles the desire for community connections and a more holistic sense of wellbeing also the way consumers snack and buy snacks around the world is diverse with consumers purchasing snacks across evolving retail and digital landscapes we expect these trends to continue and in order to position ourselves for longterm growth we are investing in our wellbeing and other snack offerings product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including ecommerce 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products over the last three years we have been seeing improvements in regional economic growth consumer confidence and growth in our categories however geopolitical and economic uncertainties from time to time may continue to affect economic growth consumer confidence and category growth as part of our new strategic plan we seek to drive category growth by offering snack innovations leveraging our local and consumerfocused commercial approach making investments in our brand and snacks portfolio building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our position across multiple channels we believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations including in emerging markets some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business see below for a discussion of brexit as well as argentina which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018 in addition the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in us trade programs trade relations regulations taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability to help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs including hedging and pricing as well as targeted investments in our brands and new routes to market 

coronavirus – we have been monitoring the outbreak of a new coronavirus that originated in china we believe it could have a negative impact on our results in the short term and we are taking steps to protect our employees consumers and business 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a localfirst commercial focus new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives product innovation and high standards of product quality we 

also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

pricing – our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs we generally have increased prices in response to higher commodity costs currency and other market factors in 2020 we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing price changes may affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning to remain competitive on our operating structure we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability such as our simplify to grow program which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs 

multiemployer pension plan – in 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the fund and recorded a 429 million estimated withdrawal liability on july 11 2019 we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the fund totaling 526 million and we recorded a 35 million final adjustment to reduce our withdrawal liability at that time during the third quarter of 2019 we began making monthly prorata payments on the 20year obligation as of december 31 2019 the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was 391 million  

taxes – during the third quarter of 2019 swiss federal and zurich cantonal tax events drove our recognition of a 767 million swiss tax reform net benefit to our results of operations the future tax rate impacts of the swiss tax reform law changes became effective on january 1 2020 and are not expected to have a material impact on our overall results of operations we will continue to monitor swiss tax reform for any additional interpretative guidance that could result in changes to the amounts we have recorded in the united states while the 2017 us tax reform reduced the us corporate tax rate and included some beneficial provisions other provisions have and in the future will have an adverse effect on our results we continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance on implementing the legislation becomes available while additional guidance has been issued by the irs and the us treasury department there are still some areas that may not be clarified for some time also a number of us states have not updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation as a result there may be additional impacts of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition it is possible that us tax reform or related interpretations could change and have an adverse effect on us that could be material 

currency – as a global company with 744 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our nonus operations including the united kingdom we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results to partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currencydenominated debt crosscurrency swaps and other financial instruments while we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position see additional discussion of brexit and argentina below and refer also to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  and note 10 financial instruments  for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks as currency movements can make comparison of yearoveryear operating performance challenging we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis holding prioryear currency exchange rates constant so that prioryear and currentyear results can be compared on a consistent basis 

brexit – on january 31 2020 the united kingdom began the withdrawal process from the european union under the european and uk parliament approved withdrawal agreement during a transition period currently scheduled to end on december 31 2020 the united kingdom will effectively remain in the eu’s customs union and single market while a trade deal with the european union is negotiated the deadline for extending the transition period ends on june 30 2020 if the transition period is not extended on december 31 2020 the united kingdom will either exit the european union without a trade deal or will begin a new trade relationship with the european union 

during the transition period we continue to take protective measures in response to the potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the united kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue earnings and cash flow in 2019 we generated 86 of our net revenues in the united kingdom and our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods following the brexit vote in june 2016 there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates the value of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar declined significantly and negatively affected our translated results reported in us dollars the volatility in foreign currencies and other markets is expected to continue as the united kingdom executes its exit from the european union if the uks membership in the european union terminates without trade and other crossborder operating agreements there could be increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and other countries including those in the european union shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods the united kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete if the ultimate terms of the uk’s separation from the european union negatively impact the uk economy or result in disruptions to sales or our supply chain the impact to our results of operations and financial condition could be material we have taken measures to increase our resources in customer service  logistics together with increasing our inventory levels of imported raw materials packaging and finished goods in the united kingdom to help us manage through the brexit transition and the inherent risks resulting impacts and market volatility can vary significantly depending on the final terms of the uk’s exit from the european union 

argentina – as further discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting on july 1 2018 we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our argentinean subsidiaries as a result we recorded a remeasurement gain of 4 million in 2019 and a remeasurement loss of 11 million in 2018 within selling general and administrative expenses related to the revaluation of the argentinean peso denominated net monetary position over these periods the mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert argentinean pesos to us dollars could change over time so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings 

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lowcost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2019 was 22  down from 23 as of december 31 2018 and up from 21 as of december 31 2017  primarily reflecting changes in our interest rates on commercial paper borrowings over these periods we continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt we also enter into crosscurrency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge our nonus net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates our net investment hedge derivative contracts have had and are expected to have a favorable impact and reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  and note 10 financial instruments  for additional information on our debt and derivative activity 

cybersecurity risks – in 2017 the malware incident impacted our operating systems and results we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats while we have taken a number of security measures to protect our systems and data security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets  

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on july 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead in our quantitative testing we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for our europe and north america reporting units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 59 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america and amea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 89  estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value 

in 2019  2018 and 2017  there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2019 annual impairment testing each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

annually we assess nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value we determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

during our 2019 annual testing of nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded 57 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2019 related to nine brands the impairments arose due to lower than expected brand earnings growth we recorded charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy brands of 39 million in europe 15 million in amea and 3 million in latin america the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we use several accepted valuation methods including relief of royalty excess earnings and excess margin that utilize estimates of future sales earnings growth rates royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brands global fair value we also identified fourteen brands including the nine impaired brands with 635 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2019 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to not be impaired but if the brand earnings expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future in 2018 we recorded charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy brands of 45 million in europe 14 million in north america and 9 million in amea in 2017 we recorded charges related to candy and gum brands of 52 million in amea 11 million in europe 5 million in latin america and 2 million in north america

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses for plans that have assets held in trust the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2020 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease on our annual benefit plan costs 



in accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements we participate in multiemployer pension plans in 2017 the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund our obligation to contribute to the fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the bctgm all of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016 in 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the fund and recorded a 429 million estimated withdrawal liability on july 11 2019 we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the fund totaling 526 million requiring prorata monthly payments over 20 years and we recorded a 35 million final adjustment to reduce our withdrawal liability as of june 30 2019 we 

began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019 as of december 31 2019  the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was 391 million

income taxes 

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities whether by settlement with tax authorities judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made 

as a result of swiss and us tax reform and the related sec guidance we finalized our accounting for the legislation based on guidance issued prior to 2019 year end see note 16 income taxes  for further discussion of the amounts recorded related to swiss and us tax reform in our financial statements as well as additional information on our effective tax rate current and deferred taxes valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits 

contingencies

new accounting guidance 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our revolving credit facilities shortterm borrowings and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and future payments of our us tax reform transition tax liability contractual and benefit plan obligations share repurchases and quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program international credit lines and longterm debt issuances for our funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 3965 million in 2019  3948 million in 2018 and 2593 million in 2017  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was due primarily to higher earnings increased distributions from equity method investments and lower pension contributions partially offset by increased working capital requirements including higher tax payments cash flows from operating activities were higher in 2018 than 2017 primarily due to higher cash flow from working capital higher net earnings as well as lower pension contributions 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 960 million in 2019  1224 million in 2018 and 301 million in 2017  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to less cash expended for acquisitions in 2019 than in 2018 lower capital expenditures and the 2019 cash proceeds from the divestiture of primarily our cheese business in the middle east and africa partially offset by lower cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts and cash paid to settle our forwardstarting interest rate swaps the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to cash received in 2017 from proceeds from divestitures cash expenditures in 2018 for an acquisition and higher capital expenditures in 2018 partially offset by cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts 

capital expenditures were 925 million in 2019  1095 million in 2018 and 1014 million in 2017  we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2020 capital expenditures to be up to 09 billion  including capital expenditures in connection with our simplify to grow program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 2787 million in 2019  2329 million in 2018 and 3361 million in 2017  the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2019 relative to 2018 was primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividends paid in 2019 partially offset by lower share repurchases the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid 

debt 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  for details of our recent tender offers debt issuances and maturities the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors due to seasonality in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital or other financing needs 

one of our subsidiaries mondelez international holdings netherlands bv “mihn” has outstanding debt refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  the operations held by mihn generated approximately 730 or 189 billion  of the 259 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2019 and represented approximately 872 or 239 billion  of the 274 billion of net assets as of december 31 2019  

on february 7 2019 our board of directors approved a new 50 billion longterm financing authority to replace the prior 50 billion authority as of december 31 2019  we had 18 billion of longterm financing authority remaining 

in the next 12 months we expect approximately 15 billion of longterm debt will mature as follows 427 million in february 2020 233 million in march 2020 750 million in may 2020 and 140 million in october 2020 we expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations shortterm debt including issuance of commercial paper and longterm debt 

our total debt was 184 billion at december 31 2019 and 184 billion at december 31 2018  our debttocapitalization ratio was 040 at december 31 2019 and 042 at december 31 2018  at december 31 2019  the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 58 years  our average daily commercial borrowings were 41 billion in 2019  45 billion in 2018 and 44 billion in 2017  we had 26 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december 31 2019 and 31 billion outstanding as of december 31 2018  we expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various shortterm financing needs we continue to comply with our debt covenants refer to note 9 debt and borrowing arrangements  for more information on our debt and debt covenants 

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production during 2019  the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials as well as increased costs for packaging energy dairy grains cocoa and oils partially offset by lower costs for sugar and nuts 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes such as dairy where there is a limited ability to hedge and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

we expect price volatility and a higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2020  while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 14 commitments and contingencies  we enter into thirdparty guarantees primarily to cover the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of these transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2019  we had no material thirdparty guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity 

aggregate contractual obligations

dividends 

we paid dividends of 1542 million in 2019  1359 million in 2018 and 1198 million in 2017  on july 30 2019 the finance committee with authorization delegated from our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0285 per share of class a common stock an increase of 10 percent which would be 114 per common share on an annualized basis on july 25 2018 the finance committee with authorization delegated from our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 026 per share of class a common stock an increase of 18 percent which would be 104 per common share on an annualized basis on august 2 2017 the finance committee with authorization delegated from our board of directors approved a 16 increase in the quarterly dividend to 022 per common share or 088 per common share on an annualized basis the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

for us income tax purposes only the company has determined that 100 of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2019 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from us earnings and profits shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we use nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have detailed the nongaap adjustments that we make in our nongaap definitions below the adjustments generally fall within the following categories acquisition  divestiture activities gains and losses on intangible asset sales and noncash impairments major program restructuring activities constant currency and related adjustments major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results we believe the nongaap measures should always be considered along with the related us gaap financial measures we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and nongaap financial measures below and we also discuss our underlying gaap results throughout our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k 

our primary nongaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prioryear operating results as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change when our definitions change we provide the updated definitions and present the related nongaap historical results on a comparable basis 1  

  

 



 10 we exclude the impact of the 2019 swiss tax reform and 2017 us tax reform during the third quarter of 2019 swiss federal and zurich cantonal tax events drove our recognition of a swiss tax reform net benefit to our results of operations on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions we exclude these tax reform impacts from our adjusted eps as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the new tax reforms refer to note 16 income taxes  for more information on our current year estimated annual effective tax rate and us and swiss tax reform 

11 we have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs restructuring program costs and discrete us tax reform impacts in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control our gaap “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items 

we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures vary among companies the nongaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k 

organic net revenue 

applying the definition of “organic net revenue” the adjustments made to “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impact of currency acquisitions and divestitures we believe that organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results we also evaluate our organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and these underlying measures are also reconciled to us gaap below 

  



adjusted operating income 

applying the definition of “adjusted operating income” the adjustments made to “operating income” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude simplify to grow program intangible asset impairment charges marktomarket impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts malware incident incremental expenses acquisition integration costs acquisition and divestiturerelated costs operating income from divestitures net gains from divestitures the remeasurement of net monetary position impact from pension participation changes impact from the resolution of tax matters ceo transition remuneration and swiss tax reform impact we also evaluate adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis we believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results

adjusted eps 

applying the definition of “adjusted eps” 1  the adjustments made to “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impacts of the items listed in the adjusted operating income tables above as well as gainslosses related to interest rate swaps loss on debt extinguishment us tax reform discrete net tax impact net gainslosses on equity method investment transactions and our proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our jde and keurig equity method investees we also evaluate adjusted eps on a constant currency basis we believe adjusted eps provides improved comparability of underlying operating results 





  






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 10 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by reportable segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results for additional information on the impact of currency policies recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies —currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions to manage input cost volatility we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings 

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to london interbank offered rates “libor” the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom plans to phase out libor by the end of 2021 we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of libor given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixedrate debt based on current and projected market conditions our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt was 22 as of december 31 2019  down from 23 as of december 31 2018  primarily due to lower interest rates on commercial paper borrowings 

beginning in 2018 we entered into new investment hedge derivative contracts specifically crosscurrency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge certain investments in our nonus operations against movements in exchange rates see note 10 financial instruments  for more information on our derivative activity 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2019 and 2018  and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

  



this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events depending on when easter falls easter holiday sales may shift between the first and second quarter we build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material funding for working capital items including inventory and receivables is normally sourced from operating cash flows and shortterm commercial paper borrowings for additional information on our liquidity working capital management cash flow and financing activities see liquidity and capital resources  note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  appearing later in this 10k filing 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience nutritional value the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of digital and other sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price improving our market position or introducing a new product 

requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures we believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position 

distribution and marketing 

we generally sell our products to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

through our global ecommerce organization and capabilities we pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world including both pure etailers and brickandmortar retailers we continue to invest in both talent and digital capabilities our ecommerce channel strategies will play a critical role in our ambition to be the best snacking company in the world 

we conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing and advertising including onair print outdoor digital and social media and other product promotions ii consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources for additional information on our commodity costs refer to the commodity trends section within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights including trademarks patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets technology and knowhow are material to our business 

we own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world depending on the country trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms we also have patents for a number of current and potential products our patents cover inventions ranging from packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks patents andor proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture sale or distribution of third party products similarly we sell some products under brands patents andor proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties in our agreement with kraft foods group inc “kraft foods group” which is now part of the kraft heinz company we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spinoff of our north american grocery business 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends wellbeing and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives these initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging scalable innovation platforms and breakthrough technologies we are in the process of completing a 65 million plan to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities we celebrated the official opening of our wroclaw poland technical center in 2017 and during 2018 we completed the modernization at the technical centers located at suzhou china jurong singapore and thane india we are focusing our technical resources at eleven large locations to drive growth and innovation our network of technical centers enable greater effectiveness improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery these locations are in curitiba brazil suzhou china thane india mexico city mexico east hanover new jersey wroclaw poland jurong singapore bournville united kingdom reading united kingdom saclay france and munich germany 

at december 31 2018  we had approximately 2400 scientists and engineers of which 1800 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs our research and development expense was 362 million in 2018  366 million in 2017 and 376 million in 2016  

regulation 

our food products and ingredients are subject to local national and multinational regulations related to labeling health and nutrition claims packaging pricing marketing and advertising privacy and related areas in addition various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities enforcing standards for select food products grading food products and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention and the scrutiny of human rights issues in industry supply chains has led to developing regulation in many countries these policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review 

examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes labeling requirements such as frontofpack labeling and nutrient profiling marketing restrictions potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials we will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material also refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  for additional information on government regulations and currencyrelated impacts on our operations in the united kingdom argentina and other countries 

environmental regulation 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act we track regulatory developments in various jurisdictions relating to the use of plastic in packaging materials and taxes linked to the costs of waste so that we can comply with evolving requirements based on information currently available we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

sustainability and wellbeing 

a key strategic priority for us is to create a positive impact for people and our planet many of the challenges facing people and the planet are interrelated so we design our core programs and initiatives holistically by working to reduce our environmental footprint supporting farmers who grow our key ingredients helping people to snack mindfully and investing in healthy lifestyle community programs through the mondelēz international foundation we continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes focusing where we can make the greatest impact for example we launched our cocoa life program in 2012 and continue to invest up to 400 million through 2022 to build a sustainable cocoa supply we are also improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in north america and through our harmony program in europe 

our 2020 sustainability goals aim to place us at the forefront in the fight against climate change with ambitious targets for an endtoend approach to reduce our carbon footprint including reducing our absolute co2 emissions from manufacturing and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains we are working to cut our absolute water footprint in manufacturing focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce we also continue to work on reducing waste in manufacturing and packaging 

within wellbeing we are focused on mindful snacking to empower people to choose the right snack for the right moment expanding our portion control options  snacks that are 200 calories or less and are individually wrapped  enables people to enjoy the treats they love become more mindful about what they eat and help manage their daily calories intake at the end of 2017 our portion control options represented approximately 13 of revenue becoming a meaningful segment of our portfolio mindful snacking is an important area of focus for us and aligns with our purpose to empower people to snack right 

the governance membership and public affairs committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our impact strategy our impact goals are part of our strategic planning process and therefore progress and key activities are regularly reported to the board of directors and the business leadership teams climate change co2 energy wellbeing and other sustainability matters are key focus areas in our strategy 

we have a robust enterprise risk management erm process for identifying measuring monitoring and managing risks with oversight by the risk and compliance committee mrcc which reports annually to the audit committee of our board of directors the purpose of the mrcc is to oversee how we identify and assess the most significant inherent risks to our business so we may adequately mitigate them or monitor them across the company all identified risks are vetted by the mrcc and remain under the mrcc’s governance ownership of specific risks is assigned at the mondelēz leadership team mlt level mlt members report directly to the ceo as owners of each specific risk mlt members are responsible for verifying that appropriate mitigation controls and monitoring systems are in place the risk universe considered during this process is wide and varied climate change is included in this risk universe as well as other sustainability and wellbeing issues 

our erm methodology is governed by the mrcc and includes annual reviews with our four operating regions considering companylevel risks by using information gathered at the asset level regions countries individual facilities and separate business units the resulting climate change sustainability and wellbeing risks are captured as follows within the erm framework commodities reputation and brand image unanticipated business disruptions changes in regulations and changes in consumer preferences 

in addition we work with internal and external experts to review the impact of major societal issues on our business and to shape our strategic responses to them materials and processes that guide our assessment include our erm process analysis of stakeholder and regulatory issues our total greenhouse gas land and water footprint proprietary consumer insight data and publicly available data on societal issues including statistics and reports from authorities nongovernmental organizations and peer companies 

we have been recognized for our ongoing economic environmental and social contributions each year since we created mondelēz international in 2012 we have been listed on the dow jones sustainability index “djsi” – world and north american indices the djsi selects the top 10 of global companies and top 20 of north american companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry we are at the 92nd percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in the areas of health  nutrition and addressing waterrelated risks 

we also participate in cdp climate and water disclosures and continue to work to reduce our carbon and water footprints from 2013 to 2017 we reported co2 emission reductions from manufacturing of 10 and reduced incoming water usage by 25 in priority factories where water is most scarce we are committed to continue this and other related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture wellbeing snacks community partnerships and safety of our products and people 

employees 

we employed through our consolidated subsidiaries approximately 80000 people worldwide at december 31 2018 and approximately 83000 at december 31 2017  employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 60 of our 68000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 12000 us employees our business units are subject to various local national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees in accordance with european union requirements we also have established a european workers council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire 

international operations 

based on where we sell our products we generated 753 of our 2018 net revenues 758 of our 2017 net revenues and 756 of our 2016 net revenues from continuing operations outside the united states we sell our products to consumers in over 150 countries at december 31 2018  we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at approximately 132 manufacturing and processing facilities in 52 countries refer to note 17 segment reporting  for additional information on our us and nonus operations refer to item 2 properties  for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities also for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and could be adversely affected if we do not effectively execute our strategy and timely respond to pricing and other competitive pressures 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include food snack and beverage companies that operate in multiple geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies if we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

competitor and customer pressures require that we timely and effectively respond to new distribution channels and technological developments and may require that we reduce our prices these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively and timely assess new or developing trends technological advancements or changes in distribution methods and set proper pricing or effective trade incentives may negatively impact our operating results achievement of our strategic and financial goals and our ability to capitalize on new revenue or valueproducing opportunities the rapid emergence of new distribution channels such as ecommerce may disrupt our current operations or strategies more quickly than we planned for create consumer price deflation alter the buying behavior of consumers or disrupt our retail customer relationships we may need to increase or reallocate spending on existing and new distribution channels and technologies marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase revenues market share and brand significance these expenditures may not be successful including those related to our ecommerce and other technologyfocused efforts and might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations additionally if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

in september 2018 we announced our new strategy which focuses on accelerating consumercentric and volumedriven growth operational excellence driven by cost discipline and continuous operational improvement including in areas like sales execution and building a winning growth culture with a “local first” commercial approach if we do not achieve these objectives effectively implement our strategy in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business or effectively adjust our culture to this change in strategy our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand image and health is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance the health of our brands’ equity launch our brands in new geographies expand into new distribution platforms including ecommerce and evolve our brands with new product offerings that meet consumer expectations 

we seek to strengthen our brands through product renovation innovation and marketing investments including consumerrelevant advertising and consumer promotions failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on wellbeing changing consumer acceptance of certain ingredients nutritional expectations of our products and the sustainability of our ingredients and our packaging could adversely affect our brands’ health increased attention from the media shareholders activists and other stakeholders in these areas as well as on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image undue caution or inaction on our part in addressing these challenges and trends could weaken our competitive position such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our labeling advertising and consumer promotions or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity or regulatory or legal action against us on product quality and safety where we manufacture our products antitrust bribery and corruption or environmental risks or human and workplace rights across our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand health such actions could undermine our customers’ and shareholders’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations our product sponsorship relationships including those with celebrity spokespersons or group affiliations could also subject us to negative publicity 

in addition our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions limit how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our brand renovation innovation and promotion plans particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about us or our brands on social media or web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts comments or activities could damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brands our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results and we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill furthermore third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks if consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future which could harm our brand image and sales if we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health then our brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new and improved products that meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences in the places and ways consumers want to shop there may be shifts in the relative size of shopping channels in addition to the increasing role of ecommerce for consumers our success relies upon managing this complexity to bring our products to consumers effectively moreover weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other factors such as severe weather events could affect consumer preferences and demand if we do not offer products that 

appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products we will not be able to meet our growth targets our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads and trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences or category trends will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those changing preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must be responsive to local consumer needs including with respect to when and how consumers snack and their desire for premium or value offerings provide an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences and use datadriven marketing and advertising to reach consumers at the right time with the right message if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories or reach consumers in efficient and effective ways leveraging data and analytics demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health environmental and social implications of certain food products and ingredients could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers have increasingly focused on wellbeing including reducing sodium and added sugar consumption as well as the source and authenticity of the foods they consume contemporizing our brand portfolio by developing more wellbeing products and refining their ingredient and nutrition profiles of existing products is critical to our growth in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 753 of our 2018 net revenues 758 of our 2017 net revenues and 756 of our 2016 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in over 150 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries therefore we are subject to risks inherent in global operations those risks include 

  

 

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war travel or immigration restrictions public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties including inaccuracies in our assumptions about these factors could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand high unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the united kingdom’s planned exit from the european union “brexit” could have a negative effect on our business see below and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial outlook for more information on brexit 

all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or long term 

tax matters including changes in tax laws and rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

in december 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation “us tax reform” the legislation implements many new us domestic and international tax provisions many aspects of us tax reform remain unclear and although additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued by the internal revenue service “irs” the us treasury department or via a technical correction law change it may not be clarified for some time in addition a number of us states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation as a result there may be further impacts of the new law on our results of operations and financial condition it is possible that us tax reform or interpretations under it could change and could have an adverse effect on us and such effect could be material 

in addition foreign jurisdictions may enact tax legislation that could significantly affect our ongoing operations for example foreign tax authorities could impose rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting payments or subject us to new types of taxes such as digital taxes aspects of us tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision additionally changes in tax laws in the us or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax provision and our results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including among others brazil china india mexico russia argentina the middle east africa southeast asia and ukraine however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries particularly those with emerging economies engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws may be more common these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers improve and expand their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and 

manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

our use of information technology and thirdparty service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us 

we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations such as manufacturing and distribution communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls executing mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services important to conducting our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware including a malware incident in june 2017 that affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks the “malware incident” see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  significant items affecting comparability  malware incident  other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security power outages hardware or software failures denial of service attacks telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences our use of new and emerging technologies such as cloudbased services and mobile applications continues to evolve presenting new and additional risks in managing access to our data relying on thirdparties to manage and safeguard data ensuring access to our systems and availability of thirdparty systems 

cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks such as hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various thirdparty service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might increase challenges and costs to resolve related issues additionally if new initiatives such as those related to ecommerce and direct sales increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain it could increase our potential exposure from a cybersecurity breach if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our thirdparty providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data such as advanced email protection to reduce the likelihood of credential thefts and electronic fraud attempts we also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on the updated threat however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis due to the constantly evolving and complex nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly 

we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and became effective in may 2018 adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 

€20 million or 4 of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year our efforts to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we utilize an integrated supply chain  a complex network of suppliers and material needs owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks shared service delivery centers and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers their suppliers or our comanufacturers if we do not effectively plan for and respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers such as occurred in connection with the malware incident see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  significant items affecting comparability  malware incident  and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected if a material or extended disruption occurs we may lose our customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition we might not have the functions processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and continue to drive efficiencies to fuel growth further our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity significant changes in trade policies changes in volume produced and changes to regulatory restrictions or laborrelated constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2018  we sold our products in over 150 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries consequently a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders in addition movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions but our efforts may not be successful we hedge a number of risks including exposures to foreign exchange rate movements and volatility of interest rates that could impact our future borrowing costs hedging of these risks could potentially subject us to counterparty credit risk in addition local economies monetary policies and currency hedging availability can affect our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses we might not be able to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency risks due to factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty inflation and limited hedging opportunities accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect future demand for our products our financial condition and results of operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or longterm 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of product packaging materials natural gas fuel and electricity for our factories and warehouses and we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products prices for raw materials other supplies and services and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations geopolitical conditions or conflicts tariffs 

or other trade barriers severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs increasing focus on climate change deforestation water plastic waste animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased government intervention and consumer or activist responses and could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business some of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers and they might lack the capacity to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products including increases to cover higher input packaging and transportation costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities including necessary services such as transportation may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices or if we are limited by supply or distribution constraints our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production packaging storage distribution sales advertising labeling and marketing as well as licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters privacy and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations as well as their interpretations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations for instance our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in taxation and trade relations among the united states and other countries including a new united statesmexicocanada agreement china or changes in the european union such as brexit 

we continue to monitor brexit and its potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the united kingdom executes its exit from the european union if the united kingdoms membership in the european union terminates in march 2019 without an agreement there could be increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and european union shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods the united kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete this potential scenario is usually referred to as a “hard brexit” in the case of a hard brexit our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the uk could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue earnings and cash flow in 2018 we generated 86 of our net revenues in the united kingdom and our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial outlook for more information on brexit 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel with a variety of capabilities in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned turnover failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as ecommerce and digital marketing skills or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or to hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness changes in our operating model and business processes including building a winning growth culture implementing our “local first” commercial approach utilizing our global shared services capability and reconfiguring our supply chain could lead to operational challenges increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals and higher employee turnover including of employees with key 

capabilities failure to achieve a more diverse workforce and leadership team compensate our employees competitively and fairly or maintain a safe and inclusive environment could affect our reputation and also result in lower performance and an inability to retain valuable employees 

we might be unable to manage appropriately changes in or that affect our workforce or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 60 of our 68000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 12000 us employees strikes work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers or distributors or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements that expired in february 2016 and that cover eight us facilities could cause disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing or distribution processes changes in immigration laws and policies including in connection with brexit could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets discounters ecommerce merchants warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and other major markets continue to consolidate form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market resulting in fewer larger customers large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or longer payment terms retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels the continued growth of ecommerce and the increasing prevalence of businesstobusiness ecommerce could lead to further consolidation as these new suppliers enhance their regional and local distribution networks in order to achieve national distribution capability in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive little difference between the quality or value of our products and those of retailer or other economy brands if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer the retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

if we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers suppliers or distributors 

during 2018  our five largest customers accounted for 168 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

additionally disputes with significant suppliers or distributors including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply or deliver products to our customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed deliberate or unintentional product contamination including contamination of ingredients we use in our products that third parties supply spoilage or other adulteration product mislabeling or product tampering in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations or if our or our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales product inventory financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations moreover a failure to maintain effective control environment processes including in connection with our global shared services capability could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners in addition execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate as appropriate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and similar strategic alliances pose additional risks as we share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time who may not have the same priorities strategies or resources as we do or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and nonfinancial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits depending on the nature of the business ventures including whether they operate globally these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are including political economic regulatory and compliance risks currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility of commodity and other input prices either partner might fail to 

recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected 

furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis as a result our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our shortand longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry could affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates our participation in multiemployer pension plans and other factors could increase our costs relating to our employees’ pensions 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world and also contribute toward our employees’ pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor at the end of 2018  the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was 111 billion and plan assets were 100 billion  

for defined benefit pension plans that we maintain the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate and government debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level 

of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we will be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost 

we also participate in multiemployer pension plans for certain us represented employees as a participating employer under multiemployer pension plans we may owe more than the contributions we are required to make under the applicable collective bargaining agreements for example if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability this withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates in the fourth quarter of 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund the “fund” we estimated a withdrawal liability of 573 million  which represents our best estimate of the withdrawal liability absent an assessment from the fund we anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019 and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently estimated amount we expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment in 2018 we recorded a 423 million discounted liability and 6 million of accrued interest to date and related charges in earnings see note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our failure to protect our valuable intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products product sales financial condition and results of operations

us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation us tax reform that included a broad range of business tax provisions including but not limited to a reduction in the us federal tax rate from 35 to 21 as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits the legislation also causes us allocated expenses eg interest and general administrative expenses to be taxed and imposes a new tax on us crossborder payments furthermore the legislation includes a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits while clarifying guidance was issued by the internal revenue service “irs” during 2018 further tax guidance is expected during 2019 

certain impacts of the new legislation would have generally required accounting to be completed and incorporated into our 2017 yearend financial statements however in response to the complexities of this new legislation the sec issued guidance to provide companies with relief the sec provided up to a oneyear window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation we finalized our accounting for the new provisions during the fourth quarter of 2018 

the 2018 impact from finalizing the accounting for the new provisions was a discrete net tax expense of 19 million the 19 million expense in 2018 is primarily comprised of a 60 million expense related to finalizing the changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion partially offset by a 38 million decrease to the transition tax estimated as of december 31 2017 refer to note 15 income taxes  for more information on the impact of us tax reform 

multiemployer pension plan withdrawal 

in the united states we contribute to multiemployer pension plans based on obligations arising from our collective bargaining agreements in 2017 and 2016 the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund the “fund” our obligation to contribute to the fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the bakery confectionery tobacco and grain millers union bctgm all of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the fund we estimated a withdrawal liability of 573 million  which represents our best estimate of the withdrawal liability absent an assessment from the fund we anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019 and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently estimated amount we will record any future adjustments in the period during which the liability is confirmed or as new information becomes available we expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment during 2018 within our north america segment we recorded a discounted liability and related charge of 423 million or 316 million net of tax we determined the net present value of the liability using a riskfree interest rate we recorded the pretax noncash charges in selling general and administrative expense and in other noncash items net in the consolidated statement of cash flows and the liability in longterm other liabilities during 2018 we also recorded 6 million of accreted interest related to the longterm liability within interest and other expense net 

malware incident 

on june 27 2017 a global malware incident impacted our business the malware affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks in the last four days of the second quarter and during the third quarter of 2017 we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact minimize damages and restore our systems environment to date we have not found nor do we expect to find any instances of company or personal data released externally we have also restored our main operating systems and processes and enhanced our system security 

for the second quarter of 2017 we estimated that the malware incident had a negative impact of 23 on our net revenue growth and 24 on our organic net revenue growth and we also incurred incremental expenses of 7 million as a result of the incident we recognized the majority of delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter 2017 results although we permanently lost some revenue on a 2017 fullyear basis we estimated the loss of revenue had a negative impact of 04 on our net revenue and organic net revenue growth we also incurred total incremental expenses of 84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort the recovery from the incident was largely resolved by december 31 2017 and we continued efforts to strengthen our security measures and enhance general information technology business process and disclosure controls 

summary of results 

  

 

 

 

 

financial outlook 

we seek to achieve profitable longterm growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps we use these nongaap financial metrics and related computations particularly growth in profit dollars to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make nearand longterm operating and strategic decisions as such we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” financial results we believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business we believe our nongaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results we have provided reconciliations between our gaap and nongaap financial measures in nongaap financial measures which appears later in this section 

in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets over the long term we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as more frequent smaller meals snacking and greater use of convenience foods we also recognize changing consumer trends such as the increased emphasis on wellbeing time compression and wide participation across an evolving retail and digital landscape to position ourselves for longterm growth we are investing in our wellbeing and other snack offerings product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including ecommerce 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products in recent years low gdp growth economic recessionary pressures weak consumer confidence a historically strong us dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category growth we have begun to see improvements in global economic growth and consumer confidence however there are still geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may affect category growth growth in our global snacking categories improved this year to approximately 27 in 2018  from 21 in 2017 and 23 in 2016 as part of our new strategic plan we seek to drive category growth through leveraging our localfirst commercial approach making additional investments in our brand and snacks portfolio building strong routes to market in both emerging and developed markets and improving our position across multiple channels we believe these actions will help drive demand in our categories and strengthen our positions across markets 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations particularly in emerging markets some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business see below for a discussion of brexit and argentina which was designated a highly inflationary economy in 2018 in addition the imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or key commodities and potential changes in us trade programs trade relations regulations taxes or fiscal policies might negatively affect our sales or profitability to help mitigate adverse effects of ongoing volatility across markets we aim to protect profitability through the management of costs including hedging and pricing as well as invest in our brands and new routes to market 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through a localfirst commercial focus new digital and other sales and marketing initiatives agile product innovation and high standards of product quality we also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

pricing – our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs we generally have increased prices in response to higher commodity costs currency and other market factors in 2019 we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing 

price changes may affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning to remain competitive on our operating structure we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability such as our simplify to grow program which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs 

multiemployer pension plan – in 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the fund we estimated a withdrawal liability of 573 million  which represents our best estimate of the withdrawal liability absent an assessment from the fund we anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019 and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently estimated amount we will record any future adjustments in the period during which the liability is confirmed or as new information becomes available we expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment during 2018 within our north america segment we recorded a discounted liability and related charge of 423 million or 316 million net of tax 

taxes – in december 2017 the united states enacted us tax reform the legislation implements many new us domestic and international tax provisions a year after enactment some aspects of us tax reform still remain unclear and although additional clarifying guidance has been issued by the irs and the us treasury department there are still some areas that may not be clarified for some time also a number of us states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation as a result there may be further impact of the new laws on our future results of operations and financial condition it is possible that us tax reform or interpretations under it could change and could have an adverse effect on us and such effect could be material 

currency – as a global company with 753 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as currency translation impacts from certain net assets of our nonus operations including the united kingdom we cannot fully predict or eliminate all adverse impacts arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results to partially offset currency translation impacts arising from our overseas operations we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currencydenominated debt and crosscurrency swaps and other financial instruments while we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position see additional discussion of brexit and argentina below and refer also to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  and note 9 financial instruments  for additional information on how we manage currency and related risks as currency movements can make comparison of yearoveryear operating performance challenging we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis holding prioryear currency exchange rates constant so that prioryear and currentyear results can be compared on a consistent basis 

brexit – we continue to monitor brexit and take protective measures in response to the potential impacts on our results of operations and financial condition our exposure to disruptions to our supply chain the imposition of tariffs and currency devaluation in the united kingdom could result in a material impact to our consolidated revenue earnings and cash flow in 2018 we generated 86 of our net revenues in the united kingdom and our supply chain in this market relies on imports of raw and packaging materials as well as finished goods following the brexit vote in june 2016 there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates the value of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar declined significantly and negatively affected our translated results reported in us dollars the volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the united kingdom executes its exit from the european union if the uks membership in the european union terminates in march 2019 without an agreement “hard brexit” there could be increased costs from reimposition of tariffs on trade between the united kingdom and european union shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures and shortages of certain goods the united kingdom will also need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world which could take years to complete if the ultimate terms of the uk’s separation from the european union negatively impact the uk economy or result in disruptions to sales or our supply chain the impact to our results of operations and financial condition could be material we are taking measures to increase our resources in customer service  logistics together with increasing our inventory levels of 

imported raw materials packaging and finished goods in the united kingdom to help us manage through the brexit transition and the inherent risks resulting impacts and market volatility can vary significantly depending on the final terms of the uk’s exit agreement from the european union 

argentina – as further discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting on july 1 2018 we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our argentinean subsidiaries during 2018 we recorded an 11 million remeasurement loss in net earnings related to the devaluation of our argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets from july 1 2018 through december 31 2018  the mix of monetary assets and liabilities and the exchange rate to convert argentinean pesos to us dollars could change over time so it is difficult to predict the overall impact of the argentina highly inflationary accounting on future net earnings 

accounting standards – we adopted a new lease accounting standard on january 1 2019 the most significant impact is the initial recognition of operating lease right of use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet while our accounting for finance leases ie capital leases remains substantially unchanged refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  for more information on the estimated impact of the new lease accounting standard 

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lowcost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2018 was 23  up from 21 as of december 31 2017 and up from 22 as of december 31 2016  primarily due to higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings in 2018 we expect to use cash and proceeds from debt issuances to finance the 12 billion of remaining us tax reform transition tax installments payable through 2026 and the estimated 573 million multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability payable over 20 years from the date of the final assessment from the fund we continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt we also enter into crosscurrency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge our nonus net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates in connection with the net investment hedge derivative contracts we expect a favorable impact on our prospective financing costs as we reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  and note 9 financial instruments  for additional information on our debt and derivative activity 

cybersecurity risks – in 2017 the malware incident impacted our operating systems and results we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we also focus on enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment including but not limited to the manufacturing environment and operational technologies as well as adjusting information security controls based on updated threats while we have taken a number of security measures to protect our systems and data security measures cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets  

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on july 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead in our quantitative testing we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for our europe and north america reporting units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 73 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america and amea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 103  estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value 

in 2018  2017 and 2016  there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2018 annual impairment testing each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

annually we assess nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value we determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

during our 2018 annual testing of nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded 68 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2018 related to five trademarks the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth we recorded charges related to gum chocolate biscuits and candy trademarks of 45 million in europe 14 million in north america and 9 million in amea the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method which utilizes estimates of future sales growth rates royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brands global fair value we also identified seven brands including the five impaired trademarks with 538 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2018 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired but if the product line expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future in 2017 we recorded charges related to candy and gum trademarks of 52 million in amea 11 million in europe 5 million in latin america and 2 million in north america in 2016 we recorded charges related to biscuits candy and gum trademarks of 41 million in amea 32 million in north america 22 million in europe and 3 million in latin america

trade and marketing programs 

we promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs these programs include but are not limited to new product introduction fees discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives as well as cooperative advertising instore displays and consumer marketing promotions trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits for accounting purposes we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates expected returns on plan assets expected compensation increases employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality and health care cost trends we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses for plans that have assets held in trust the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2019 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease on our annual benefit plan costs 

  



in accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements we participate in multiemployer pension plans in 2017 and 2016 the only individually significant multiemployer plan we contributed to was the bakery and confectionery union and industry international pension fund our obligation to contribute to the fund arose with respect to 8 collective bargaining agreements covering most of our employees represented by the bctgm all of those collective bargaining agreements expired in 2016 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we executed a complete withdrawal from the fund we estimated a withdrawal liability of 573 million  which represents our best estimate of the withdrawal liability absent an assessment from the fund we anticipate receiving an assessment in 2019 and the ultimate withdrawal liability may change from the currently 

estimated amount we will record any future adjustments in the period during which the liability is confirmed or as new information becomes available we expect to pay the liability over a period of 20 years from the date of the assessment during 2018 within our north america segment we recorded a discounted liability and related charge of 423 million or 316 million net of tax we determined the net present value of the liability using a riskfree interest rate we recorded the pretax noncash charges in selling general and administrative expense and in other noncash items net in the consolidated statement of cash flows and the liability in longterm other liabilities during 2018 we also recorded 6 million of accreted interest related to the longterm liability within interest and other expense net 

see additional information on our employee benefit plans in note 10 benefit plans  

income taxes 

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities whether by settlement with tax authorities judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made 

as a result of us tax reform and the related sec guidance we finalized our accounting for the legislation based on guidance that was issued prior to 2018 year end and included updates to the prior provisional estimates in our 2018 consolidated financial statements see note 15 income taxes  for further discussion of the amounts recorded related to us tax reform in our financial statements as well as additional information on our effective tax rate current and deferred taxes valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits 

contingencies

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our revolving credit facilities shortterm borrowings and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures and future payments of our us tax reform transition tax liability contractual and benefit plan obligations share repurchases and quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program international credit lines and longterm debt issuances for our funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 3948 million in 2018  2593 million in 2017 and 2838 million in 2016  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was due primarily to higher cash flow from working capital higher net earnings as well as lower pension contributions cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2017 than 2016 primarily due to increases in working capital including higher tax and vatrelated payments in 2017 and lower operating cash flows from divested businesses partially offset by higher net earnings and lower pension contributions in 2017 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1224 million in 2018  301 million in 2017 and 1029 million in 2016  the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to cash received in 2017 from proceeds from divestitures cash expenditures in 2018 for an acquisition and higher capital expenditures in 2018 partially offset by cash received as a result of the settlement and replacement of several net investment hedge derivative contracts the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was due to higher net proceeds received from divestitures in 2017 no acquisitionrelated payments in 2017 as in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in 2017 

capital expenditures were 1095 million in 2018  1014 million in 2017 and 1224 million in 2016  we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2019 capital expenditures to be up to 10 billion  including capital expenditures in connection with our simplify to grow program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 2329 million in 2018  3361 million in 2017 and 1862 million in 2016  the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2018 relative to 2017 was primarily due to higher net debt issuances and lower share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was primarily due to lower net issuances of shortterm and longterm debt as well as an increase in dividends paid partly offset by lower share repurchases compared to 2016 

debt 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for details of our recent tender offers debt issuances and maturities the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors due to seasonality in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital or other financing needs 

during 2016 one of our subsidiaries mondelez international holdings netherlands bv “mihn” issued debt totaling 45 billion  the operations held by mihn generated approximately 741 or 192 billion  of the 259 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2018 and represented approximately 805 or 207 billion  of the 257 billion of net assets as of december 31 2018  

on february 7 2019 our board of directors approved a new 50 billion longterm financing authority to replace the prior 50 billion authority as of december 31 2018  we had 17 billion of longterm financing authority remaining 

in the next 12 months we expect approximately 27 billion of longterm debt will mature as follows 400 million in february 2019 and 23 billion in october 2019 we expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or longterm debt 

our total debt was 184 billion at december 31 2018 and 177 billion at december 31 2017  our debttocapitalization ratio was 042 at december 31 2018 and 040 at december 31 2017  at december 31 2018  the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 58 years  our average daily commercial borrowings were 45 billion in 2018  44 billion in 2017 and 22 billion in 2016  we had 31 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december 31 2018 and 34 billion outstanding as of december 31 2017  we expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short and longterm financing needs and to continue to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for more information on our debt and debt covenants 

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production during 2018  the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currencyrelated costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for packaging dairy energy grains oils and other raw materials partially offset by lower costs for cocoa sugar and nuts 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes such as dairy where there is a limited ability to hedge and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2019  while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 13 commitments and contingencies  we enter into thirdparty guarantees primarily to cover the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of these transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2018  we had no material thirdparty guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2018

between 2013 and 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of a total of 137 billion of our common stock through december 31 2018 on january 31 2018 our finance committee with authorization delegated from our board of directors approved an increase of 60 billion in the share repurchase program raising the authorization to 197 billion of common stock repurchases and extended the program through december 31 2020 we repurchased approximately 150 billion of shares  20 billion in 2018 22 billion in 2017 26 billion in 2016 36 billion in 2015 19 billion in 2014 and 27 billion in 2013 at a weightedaverage cost of 3930 per share through december 31 2018 the number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion additionally our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate we may accelerate suspend delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time without notice 

dividends 

we paid dividends of 1359 million in 2018  1198 million in 2017 and 1094 million in 2016  on july 25 2018 the finance committee with authorization delegated from our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 026 per share of class a common stock an increase of 18 percent which would be 104 per common share on an annualized basis on august 2 2017 the finance committee with authorization delegated from our board of directors approved a 16 increase in the quarterly dividend to 022 per common share or 088 per common share on an annualized basis on july 19 2016 our board of directors approved a 12 increase in the quarterly dividend to 019 per common share or 076 per common share on an annual basis the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

for us income tax purposes only the company has determined that 100 of the distributions paid to its shareholders in 2018 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from us earnings and profits shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we use nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have detailed the nongaap adjustments that we make in our nongaap definitions below the adjustments generally fall within the following categories acquisition  divestiture activities gains and losses on intangible asset sales and noncash impairments major program restructuring activities constant currency and related adjustments major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results we believe the nongaap measures should always be considered along with the related us gaap financial measures we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and nongaap financial measures below and we also discuss our underlying gaap results throughout our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k 

our primary nongaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prioryear operating results as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change when our definitions change we provide the updated definitions and present the related nongaap historical results on a comparable basis 1  

  

 



 10 on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions as further detailed in note 15 income taxes  we exclude the discrete us tax reform impacts from our adjusted eps as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under us tax reform 

11 we have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ unusual or infrequent items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs restructuring program costs and discrete us tax reform impacts in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and unusual or infrequent items with them each reporting period we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control our gaap “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ unusual and infrequent items 

we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures vary among companies the nongaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k 

organic net revenue 

applying the definition of “organic net revenue” the adjustments made to “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impact of currency acquisitions and divestitures we believe that organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results we also evaluate our organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and power brands and these underlying measures are also reconciled to us gaap below 

  





adjusted operating income 

applying the definition of “adjusted operating income” the adjustments made to “operating income” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude simplify to grow program intangible asset impairment charges marktomarket impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts malware incident incremental expenses acquisition integration costs acquisitionrelated and divestiturerelated costs the operating results of divestitures gain on divestitures the remeasurement of net monetary position the impact from pension participation changes the impact from the resolution of tax matters and ceo transition remuneration we also evaluate adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis we believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results 

  





  

 

adjusted eps 

applying the definition of “adjusted eps” 1  the adjustments made to “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impacts of the items listed in the adjusted operating income tables above as well as net gain or loss related to interest rate swaps loss on debt extinguishment us tax reform discrete impacts gain on equity method investment transactions and our proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our jde and keurig equity method investees we also evaluate adjusted eps on a constant currency basis we believe adjusted eps provides improved comparability of underlying operating results 

  





  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 9 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by reportable segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results for additional information on the impact of currency policies recent currency devaluations and highly inflationary accounting on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies —currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions to manage input cost volatility we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings 

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads commercial paper rates as well as limited debt tied to london interbank offered rates “libor” the financial conduct authority in the united kingdom plans to phase out libor by the end of 2021 we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of libor given our current mix of variable and fixedrate debt we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt was 23 as of december 31 2018  up from 21 as of december 31 2017 primarily due to higher interest rates on commercial paper borrowings 

beginning in the first quarter of 2018 we entered into new investment hedge derivative contracts specifically crosscurrency interest rate swaps and forwards to hedge certain investments in our nonus operations against movements in exchange rates see note 9 financial instruments  for more information on our derivative activity there were no other significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between december 31 2017 and december 31 2018  

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2018 and 2017  and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017  the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

  



this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

reportable segments 

our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments 

    on october 1 2016 we integrated our eastern europe middle east and africa “eemea” operating segment into our europe and asia pacific operating segments to further leverage and optimize the operating scale built within the europe and asia pacific regions russia ukraine turkey belarus georgia and kazakhstan were combined within our europe region while the remaining middle east and african countries were combined within our asia pacific region to form the amea operating segment we have reflected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented 

we manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets our regional management teams have responsibility for the business product categories and financial results in the regions 

we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends for a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pretax earnings as well as other information on our segments see note 16 segment reporting  

our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were 

 



our segment operating income for each of the last three years was 

 



the deconsolidation of our global coffee business in 2015 the deconsolidation of our venezuela operations beginning with our 2016 results currency and other items significantly affect the comparability of our consolidated and segment operating results from year to year please see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a review of our operating results 

our brands span five product categories 

      

during 2017 our segments contributed to our net revenues in the following product categories 

 



within our product categories the classes of products that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net revenues were 

 



significant divestitures and acquisitions 

for information on our significant divestitures and acquisitions please refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions and specifically in connection with our global coffee business deconsolidation see the discussions under jde coffee business transactions and keurig transaction  

customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2017 our five largest customers accounted for 156 and our ten largest customers accounted for 214 of net revenues from continuing operations in 2017 

seasonality 

demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events depending on when easter falls easter holiday sales may shift between the first and second quarter we build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material funding for working capital items including inventory and receivables is normally sourced from operating cash flows and shortterm commercial paper borrowings for additional information on our liquidity working capital management cash flow and financing activities see liquidity and capital resources  note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  appearing later in this 10k filing 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience nutritional value the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures we believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position 

 

distribution and marketing 

across our segments we generally sell our products to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

consumers are also increasingly shopping online and we are building a global ecommerce organization and capabilities to pursue online growth with partners in key markets around the world including both pure etailers and brickandmortar retailers we continue to invest in both talent and capabilities our ecommerce channel strategies will play a critical role in our ambition to be the best snacking company in the world 

we conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing and advertising including onair print outdoor digital and social media and other product promotions ii consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources for additional information on our commodity costs refer to the commodity trends section within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights including trademarks patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets technology and knowhow are material to our business 

we own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world depending on the country trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms we also have patents for a number of current and potential products our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks patents andor proprietary trade secrets in connection with the manufacture sale or distribution of third party products similarly we sell some products under brands patents andor proprietary trade secrets we license from third parties in our agreement with kraft foods group inc “kraft foods group” which is now part of the kraft heinz company we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spinoff of our north american grocery business 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends wellness products and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives these initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation platforms power brands and breakthrough technologies in september 2016 we announced our plan to invest 65 million over 20172018 to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities we are focusing our technical resources at nine large locations to drive global growth and innovation we celebrated the official opening of our wroclaw poland technical center in 2017 our global technical centers will enable greater effectiveness improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery these locations are in curitiba brazil suzhou china thane india mexico city mexico east hanover new jersey wroclaw poland jurong singapore bournville united kingdom and reading united kingdom 

at december 31 2017 we had approximately 2450 scientists and engineers of which 1900 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs our research and development expense was 366 million in 2017 376 million in 2016 and 409 million in 2015 

regulation 

our food products and ingredients are subject to local national and multinational regulations related to labeling health and nutrition claims packaging pricing marketing and advertising privacy and related areas in addition various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities enforcing standards for select food products grading food products and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention and the scrutiny of human rights issues in industry supply chains has led to developing regulation in many countries these policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review 

examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes labeling requirements such as frontofpack labeling and nutrient profiling marketing restrictions potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials we will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material also refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  for additional information on government regulations and currencyrelated impacts on our operations in the united kingdom argentina and other countries 

environmental regulation 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act based on information currently available we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

 

sustainability 

a key strategic goal for us is to grow our impact building positive impact for people and our planet is at the core of who we are we call our commitment to drive business growth with positive change in the world impact for growth  many of the challenges facing people and the planet are interrelated our core programs and initiatives holistically address both by working to reduce our environmental footprint empower farmers and support the communities where our snacks are sourced we continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes focusing on where we can make the most impact for example we launched our cocoa life program in 2012 and will continue to invest up to 400 million through 2022 to build a sustainable cocoa supply we are also improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in north america and through our harmony program in europe

our 2020 sustainability goals aim to place us at the forefront in the fight against climate change with ambitious targets for an endtoend approach to reduce our carbon footprint including reducing our absolute co 2 emissions from manufacturing and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains we are working to cut our absolute water footprint in manufacturing focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce we are also working to reduce waste in manufacturing and packaging 

we have been recognized for our ongoing economic environmental and social contributions this year we were again listed on the dow jones sustainability index “djsi” – world and north american indices the djsi selects the top 10 of global companies and top 20 of north american companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry we are at the 92 nd percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in health and nutrition and environmental reporting 

we also participate in the cdp climate and water disclosures and continue to work to reduce our carbon and water footprints we are committed to continue this and other related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture wellbeing snacks community partnerships and safety of our products and people 

employees 

we employed through our consolidated subsidiaries approximately 83000 people worldwide at december 31 2017 and approximately 90000 at december 31 2016 employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 64 of our 71000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 12000 us employees our business units are subject to various local national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees in accordance with european union requirements we also have established a european workers council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire

based on where we sell our products we generated 758 of our 2017 net revenues 756 of our 2016 net revenues and 787 of our 2015 net revenues from continuing operations outside the united states we sell our products to consumers in approximately 160 countries at december 31 2017 we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at approximately 140 manufacturing and processing facilities in 51 countries refer to note 16 segment reporting for additional information on our us and nonus operations refer to item 2 properties  for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities also for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states see item 1a risk factors

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include major international food snack and beverage companies that operate in multiple geographic areas and numerous local and regional companies if we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively and timely assess change and set proper pricing or effective trade incentives may negatively impact our operating results and achievement of our strategic and financial goals the rapid emergence of new distribution channels such as ecommerce may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases we may need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising new product innovation and existing and new distribution channels to protect or increase market share these expenditures might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

in addition like other companies in our industry we are under pressure to continue to improve the efficiency of our overall cost structure we are pursuing a transformation agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio improving our cost structure and operating model and accelerating our growth if we do not achieve these objectives or do not implement transformation in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand quality and image extend our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms including ecommerce and expand our brand image with new and renewed product offerings 

we seek to enhance our brand image through product renovation innovation and marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on wellbeing changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients nutritional expectations of our products and increased attention from the media shareholders activists and other stakeholders on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image undue caution or inaction on our part in addressing these challenges and trends could weaken our competitive position such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and labeling or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity or regulatory or legal action against us on product quality and safety where we manufacture our products or environmental risks or human and workplace rights across our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image such actions could undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations our product sponsorship relationships could also subject us to negative publicity 

in addition our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions limit how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our brand renovation innovation and promotion plans particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about us or our brands on social media or web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts comments or activities could seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brands our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results and we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our brands or related intangible assets or goodwill furthermore third parties may sell counterfeit or spurious versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks if consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future which could harm our brand image and sales if we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand image then our brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 758 of our 2017 net revenues 756 of our 2016 net revenues and 787 of our 2015 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in approximately 160 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries therefore we are subject to risks inherent in global operations those risks include 

 

           in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war travel or immigration restrictions public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand high unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the united kingdom’s planned exit from the european union “brexit” including currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets could have a negative effect on our business all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or long term 

tax matters including changes in tax laws and rates disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

in december 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation “us tax reform” the legislation implements many new us domestic and international tax provisions many aspects of the us tax reform are unclear and although additional clarifying guidance is expected to be issued in the future by the internal revenue service “irs” the us treasury department or via a technical correction law change it may not be clarified for some time in addition many us states have not yet updated their laws to take into account the new federal legislation as a result we have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new laws on our results of operations and financial condition it is possible that us tax reform or interpretations under it could change and could have an adverse effect on us and such effect could be material 

 

in addition foreign jurisdictions may also enact tax legislation that could significantly affect our ongoing operations for example foreign tax authorities could impose rate changes along with additional corporate tax provisions that would disallow or tax perceived base erosion or profit shifting aspects of us tax reform may lead foreign jurisdictions to respond by enacting additional tax legislation that is unfavorable to us 

adverse changes in the underlying profitability or financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets and result in a charge to our income tax provision additionally changes in tax laws in the us or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities and our income tax provision 

we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken we could face additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could significantly adversely affect our income tax provision and our results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including among others brazil china india mexico russia argentina ukraine the middle east africa and southeast asia however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries particularly those with emerging economies engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws may be more common these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers improve and expand their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected such as occurred when we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan operations at the close of 2015 or any potential impact on our business in venezuela from future economic or political developments 

our use of information technology and third party service providers exposes us to cybersecurity breaches and other business disruptions that could adversely affect us 

we use information technology and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities including supporting critical business operations communicating with our suppliers customers and employees maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business including a number of accounting internal control human resources and computing functions 

 

continuity of business applications and services has been and may in the future be disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware like the global malware incident in june 2017 that affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks the “malware incident” see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – malware incident  other cybersecurity attacks issues with or errors in systems’ maintenance or security migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures denial of service telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic occurrences further cybersecurity breaches of our or third party systems whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyberattacks hacking phishing attacks computer viruses ransomware or malware employee or insider error malfeasance social engineering physical breaches or other actions may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached when risks such as these materialize the need for us to coordinate with various third party service providers and for third party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues additionally if new initiatives such as those related to ecommerce and direct sales increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain this could increase our potential exposure to a cybersecurity breach if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans or those of our third party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation or brands 

we continue to devote focused resources to network security backup and disaster recovery enhanced training and other security measures to protect our systems and data we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment however security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis in addition due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident and the cost and operational expense of implementing maintaining and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly 

we regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and becomes effective in may 2018 adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches and imposes substantial penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of € 20 million or 4 of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year our efforts to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we utilize an integrated supply chain – a complex network of suppliers and material needs owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks shared service delivery centers and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather including any potential effects of climate change natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions terrorism political unrest cybersecurity breaches generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers such as occurred in connection with the malware incident see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – malware incident  and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected if a material or extended disruption occurs we may lose our customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition we might not have the functions processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth further our ability to supply 

 

multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity significant changes in trade policies changes in volume produced and changes to regulatory restrictions or laborrelated constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2017 we sold our products in approximately 160 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries consequently a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders in addition movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions but our efforts may not be successful accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners flavoring agents and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses prices for these raw materials other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations political conditions severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs increasing focus on climate change deforestation water plastic waste animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased government intervention and consumer or activist responses and could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers and they might lack the capacity to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase or changes in the types of commodities we purchase as we continue to evolve our product and packaging portfolio could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products including increases to cover higher input costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices or if we are limited by supply constraints our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production packaging storage distribution sales advertising labeling and marketing as well as licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations as well as their interpretations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations for instance our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in taxation and trade relations among the united states and other countries including any changes to or repeal of the north american free trade agreement or changes in the european union such as brexit 

 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel with a variety of capabilities in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned turnover failure to attract and develop personnel with key emerging capabilities such as ecommerce and digital marketing skills or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate skilled employees 

we also face increased personnelrelated risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda related to our operating model and business processes including building a global shared services capability and reconfiguring our supply chain these risks could lead to operational challenges including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals higher employee turnover including of employees with key capabilities and challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to build and effectively execute a shared services function and transform our business processes furthermore we might be unable to manage appropriately changes in or that affect our workforce or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 64 of our 71000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 12000 us employees strikes work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers or distributors or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements that expired in february 2016 and that cover eight us facilities could cause disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing or distribution processes 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and other major markets continue to consolidate form buying alliances or be acquired by new entrants in the food retail market resulting in fewer larger customers large retail customers and customer alliances can delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or longer payment terms retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive little difference between the quality or value of our products and those of retailer or other economy brands if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer the retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

if we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers 

during 2017 our five largest customers accounted for 156 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

additionally disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed deliberate or unintentional product contamination including contamination of ingredients we use in our products that third parties supply spoilage or other adulteration product mislabeling or product tampering in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations or if our or our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales product inventory financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations moreover a failure to maintain effective control environment processes including in connection with the development of our global shared services capability could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new and improved products that meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences moreover weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other factors such as severe weather events could affect consumer preferences and demand if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

 

we must distinguish between shortterm fads and trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences or category trends will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those changing preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied and geographically diverse consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health environmental and social implications of certain food products and ingredients could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers have increasingly focused on wellbeing including reducing sodium and added sugar consumption developing more wellbeing products and contemporizing our brands by refining their ingredient and nutrition profiles are critical to our growth in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners in addition execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate as appropriate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate timely and ongoing compliance with antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and similar strategic alliances pose additional risks as we share ownership and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time who may not have the same priorities strategies or resources as we do or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and nonfinancial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits depending on the nature of the business ventures including whether they operate globally these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are including political economic regulatory and compliance risks currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility of commodity and other input prices either partner might fail to recognize an alliance relationship that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected 

furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

we could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis as a result our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our shortand longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry could affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates our participation in multiemployer pension plans and other factors could increase our costs relating to our employees’ pensions 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world and also contribute toward our employees’ pensions under defined benefit plans that we do not sponsor at the end of 2017 the projected benefit obligation of the defined benefit pension plans we sponsor was 126 billion and plan assets were 110 billion 

for defined benefit pension plans that we maintain the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate and government debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we will be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost 

we also participate in multiemployer pension plans our exposure under those plans may extend beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our own employees our contributions to a multiemployer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multiemployer plan and the financial viability of other employers in the plan we may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer and our costs might increase as a result further if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability this withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates see note 9 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our failure to protect our valuable intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products product sales financial condition and results of operations

us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions including but not limited to a reduction in the us federal tax rate from 35 to 21 as well as provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions or credits the legislation also causes us allocated expenses eg interest and general administrative expenses to be taxed and imposes a new tax on us crossborder payments furthermore the legislation includes a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and profits 

in response to the enactment of us tax reform the sec issued guidance to address the complexity in accounting for this new legislation when the initial accounting for items under the new legislation is incomplete the guidance allows us to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made or to continue to apply the prior tax law if a reasonable estimate of the impact cannot be made the sec has provided up to a oneyear window for companies to finalize the accounting for the impacts of this new legislation and we anticipate finalizing our accounting during 2018 

while our accounting for the new us tax legislation is not complete we have made reasonable estimates for some provisions and recognized a 59 million discrete net tax benefit in our 2017 financial statements this net benefit is primarily comprised of a 1311 million provisional deferred tax benefit from revaluing our net us deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new us corporate tax rate as well as an additional 61 million provisional deferred tax benefit related to changes in our indefinite reinvestment assertion partially offset by a 1317 million provisional charge for the estimated transition tax however as of the date of this form 10k we are continuing to evaluate the accounting impacts of the legislation as we continue to assemble and analyze all the information required to prepare and analyze these effects and await additional guidance from the us treasury department the irs or other standardsetting bodies additionally we continue to analyze other information and regulatory guidance and accordingly we may record additional provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts in future periods see note 14 income taxes  for further details on the impacts of us tax reform 

malware incident 

on june 27 2017 a global malware incident impacted our business the malware affected a significant portion of our global sales distribution and financial networks in the last four days of the second quarter and during the third quarter we executed business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact minimize damages and restore our systems environment to date we have not found nor do we expect to find any instances of company or personal data released externally we have now restored our main operating systems and processes as well as enhanced our system security 

 

during 2017 we estimate that the loss of revenue as a result of the malware incident had a negative impact of 04 on our net revenue and organic net revenue growth we also incurred incremental expenses of 84 million predominantly during the second half of 2017 as part of the recovery effort we believe the recovery from this incident is largely resolved and we do not expect significant ongoing impacts or incremental expenses from this incident in future periods we also continue to make progress on our efforts to strengthen our security measures and mitigate cybersecurity risk refer to our risk factors section for a discussion of potential risks to our operations from cybersecurity threats 

coffee business transactions

keurig transaction 

following the march 3 2016 acorn holdings bv acquisition of keurig on march 7 2016 we exchanged a portion of our equity interest in jde for an interest in keurig valued at 20 billion we recorded the difference between the fair value of the keurig interest and our basis in jde shares as a 43 million gain following the exchange our ownership interest in jde became 265 and we owned a 242 interest in keurig our initial 20 billion investment in keurig includes a 16 billion keurig equity interest and a 04 billion shareholder loan receivable which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our consolidated balance sheet the shareholder loan has a 55 interest rate and is payable at the end of a sevenyear term on february 27 2023 we recorded keurig equity earnings of 208 million in 2017 of which approximately 119 million relates to the provisional tax benefit keurig recorded as a result of us tax reform and 77 million in 2016 we recorded shareholder loan interest of 24 million in 2017 and 20 million in 2016 additionally we received shareholder loan interest payments of 30 million in 2017 and 14 million in 2016 and dividends of 14 million in 2017 and 4 million in 2016 see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions for additional details on the keurig transaction

venezuela deconsolidation 

effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year we deconsolidated our venezuelan subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our venezuelan operations and an otherthantemporary lack of currency exchangeability we recorded a 778 million pretax loss on december 31 2015 as we reduced the value of our investment in venezuela and all venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value resulting in full impairment 

as of the start of 2016 we no longer included net revenues earnings or net assets of our venezuelan subsidiaries within our gaap consolidated financial statements and we excluded venezuela from our nongaap results for all historical periods presented to facilitate comparisons of operating results see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting venezuela  for more information on our venezuela operations including currency remeasurement losses and the loss on deconsolidation 

 

summary of results 

 

  

  

  

 financial outlook 

we seek to achieve profitable longterm growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps we use these nongaap financial metrics and related computations such as margins internally to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make nearand longterm operating and strategic decisions as such we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” financial results we believe providing investors with the same financial information that we use internally ensures that investors have the same data to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and gain additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we believe our nongaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results and we have provided reconciliations between our gaap and nongaap financial measures within nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section 

in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics we monitor a number of developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of populations and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets over the long term we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as more frequent smaller meals snacking and greater use of convenience foods we also recognize changing consumer trends such as the increased emphasis on wellbeing time compression and wide participation across an evolving retail and digital landscape to position ourselves for longterm growth we are investing in our wellbeing and other snack offerings product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including ecommerce 

 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products in recent years low gdp growth economic recessionary pressures weak consumer confidence a historically strong us dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category and our net revenue growth while we have begun to see some improvements in global economic growth and a weaker us dollar in 2017 there are still geopolitical and economic uncertainties and category growth continues to be soft growth in our global snacking categories excluding venezuela decreased from approximately 34 in 2015 and 24 in 2016 to 21 in 2017 we continue to make investments in our brand and snacks portfolio while building strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets in doing so we anticipate driving demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations particularly in emerging markets some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—venezuela  for further discussion of these issues and their impacts on our venezuela operations we expect continued volatility across our markets particularly emerging markets as such we are focused on investing in our global power brands and routes to market while we protect our margins through the management of costs and pricing 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through new product innovations and product quality we also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

pricing – we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions over 20152017 we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs currency and other market factors in 2018 we anticipate changing market conditions to continue to impact pricing price competition may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to changes in input costs and other market conditions 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning we continue to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements covering eight us facilities that expired beginning in february 2016 we have plans to ensure business continuity during the renegotiations to remain competitive on our operating structure we continue to work on programs to expand our profitability and margins such as our 20142018 restructuring program which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs effective on october 1 2016 we also integrated our eemea region operations into our europe and asia pacific operating segments this change had a favorable impact on our operating performance due to greater leverage of our european and amea regional businesses and resulting cost structure 

taxes – while the 2017 us tax reform reduced the us corporate tax rate and included beneficial depreciation provisions other provisions could have an adverse effect on our results specifically new provisions that cause us allocated expenses eg interest and general administrative expenses to be taxed and impose a tax on us crossborder payments could adversely impact our effective tax rate we will continue to evaluate the impacts as additional guidance on implementing the legislation becomes available 

 

currency – as a global company with 758 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are continually exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements in 2017 the us dollar began to weaken relative to other currencies in which we operate while in 2015 and 2016 the us dollar generally was stronger as a number of countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency the currency movements created volatility in our reported results of operations unfavorable currency translation impacts were 126 percentage points or 120 percentage points excluding currency impacts related to venezuela of the 135 net revenue decrease in 2015 and 46 percentage points of the 125 net revenue decrease in 2016 in 2017 the 01 net revenue decrease reflected 03 percentage points of favorable currency translation impacts as the us dollar generally weakened against a number of currencies this past year as currency movements can make comparisons of yearoveryear operating performance challenging we isolate the impact of currency and also report growth on a constant currency basis holding prioryear currency exchange rates constant so that prioryear and currentyear results can be compared on a consistent basis 

historically we have also been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly but not only in connection with our venezuela operations that were deconsolidated at the close of the 2015 fiscal year in the months following the brexit vote in june 2016 there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates the value of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar declined significantly and negatively affected our translated results reported in us dollars in december 2017 the european union and united kingdom agreed to begin trade negotiations and we could experience additional volatility in the british pound sterling as the brexit negotiations move forward 

to partially offset the translation of certain of our overseas operations including the united kingdom we enter into net investment hedges primarily in the form of local currency denominated debt and crosscurrency swaps and other financial instruments we generally do not hedge against currency translation and primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on crosscurrency transactions due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our crosscurrency transaction risks local economies monetary policies and currency hedging availability can affect our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses while we work to mitigate our exposure to currency risks factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to unfavorable currency impacts in the future we monitor currencyrelated risks and economies at risk of qualifying for highly inflationary accounting under us gaap such as argentina and ukraine while we work to safeguard our business currency devaluations could adversely affect future demand for our products our financial results and operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or longterm we may not be able to fully offset the increased risks related to currency devaluations and brexit which could impact profitability should the currencyrelated conditions continue see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  and note 8 financial instruments  for additional information 

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lowcost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases we also expect to use existing cash or shortterm borrowings to finance the estimated 13 billion us tax reform transition tax liability payable through 2026 during 2017 we retired 15 billion of longterm debt and issued lowercost shortterm commercial paper and longterm swiss franc debt during 2016 we retired 62 billion of our longterm debt and issued lowercost longterm euro swiss franc and us dollardenominated debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2017 was 21 down from 22 as of december 31 2016 and down from 37 as of december 31 2015 we also continue to use interest rate swaps and other financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and cash flow variability protect the value of our existing currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt for example through february 8 2018 we entered into crosscurrency interest rate swaps and forwards with an aggregate notional value of 32 billion to hedge our nonus net investments against adverse movements in exchange rates we designated these swaps and forwards as net investment hedges related to our operations in our europe and amea regions we expect a favorable impact on our prospective financing costs as we reduce some of the financing costs and related currency impacts within our interest costs refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  and note 8 financial instruments  for additional information on our debt and derivative activity

excluding the factors noted above selling general and administrative expenses decreased 405 million from 2016 the decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas 

currency changes during the year did not impact operating income as the strength of the us dollar relative to several currencies including the egyptian pound british pound sterling and argentinean peso was offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the us dollar including the euro brazilian real russian ruble australian dollar indian rupee and south african rand 

operating income margin increased from 99 in 2016 to 135 in 2017 the increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in our adjusted operating income margin lower 20142018 restructuring program costs the benefits from the resolution of tax matters the net gain on divestitures and lower divestiturerelated costs partially offset by incremental costs related to the malware incident and ceo transition remuneration costs adjusted operating income margin increased from 150 in 2016 to 163 in 2017 the increase in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due to continued cost reduction efforts in both areas

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets  

we have historically annually tested goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment as of october 1 this year we voluntarily changed the annual impairment assessment date from october 1 to july 1 we believe this measurement date which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle is preferable because it better aligns with our strategic business planning process and financial forecasts which are key components of the annual impairment tests the change in the measurement date did not delay accelerate or prevent an impairment charge each quarter we have evaluated goodwill and intangible asset impairment risks and recognized any related impairments to date as such the change in the annual test date was applied on july 1 2017 

we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead in our quantitative testing we compare a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for our europe and north america reporting units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 72 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america and amea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 102 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value 

in 2017 2016 and 2015 there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2017 annual impairment testing each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing if we do not meet business performance expectations or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

annually we assess nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value we determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

 

during our 2017 annual testing of nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded 70 million of impairment charges in the third quarter of 2017 related to five trademarks the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other regional and global brands we recorded charges related to candy and gum trademarks of 52 million in amea 11 million in europe 5 million in latin america and 2 million in north america the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method which utilizes estimates of future sales growth rates royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value we also noted thirteen brands including the five impaired trademarks with 963 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2017 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired but if we do not meet the product line expectations or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future in 2016 we recorded charges related to biscuits candy and gum trademarks of 41 million in amea 32 million in north america 22 million in europe and 3 million in latin america in 2015 we recorded a 44 million charge related to candy and biscuit trademarks in amea 22 million in europe and 5 million in latin america

trade and marketing programs 

we promote our products with trade and sales incentives as well as marketing and advertising programs these programs include but are not limited to new product introduction fees discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives as well as cooperative advertising instore displays and consumer marketing promotions trade and sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer promotion expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated sales volume and estimated program spending we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing and advertising costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits for accounting purposes we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates expected returns on plan assets expected compensation increases employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality and health care cost trends we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses as many of our pension plans are partially funded the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 9 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2018 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease on our annual benefit plan costs 

 



income taxes 

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon resolution we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities whether by settlement with tax authorities judicial or administrative ruling or due to expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made 

as a result of the us tax reform and the related sec guidance we included provisional estimates in our consolidated financial statements for some impacts of the new tax legislation we were unable to make a reasonable estimate for other provisions of the legislation and did not include an estimate in our consolidated financial statements see note 14 income taxes  for further discussion of the provisional amounts related to us tax reform included in our financial statements and a discussion of the items for which no estimate could be made as well as additional information on our effective tax rate current and deferred taxes valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our revolving credit facilities and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations share repurchases transition tax liability on our historical accumulated foreign earnings due to the us tax reform and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program international credit lines and longterm debt issuances for regular funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 2593 million in 2017 2838 million in 2016 and 3728 million in 2015 cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2017 than 2016 primarily due to increases in working capital including higher tax and vatrelated payments in 2017 and lower operating cash flows from divested businesses partially offset by higher net earnings and lower pension contributions in 2017 cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2016 than 2015 due to higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2016 and higher working capital cash improvements in 2015 than in 2016

net cash provided byused in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 301 million in 2017 and 1029 million in 2016 and net cash provided by investing activities was 2649 million in 2015 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was due to higher net proceeds received from divestitures in 2017 no acquisitionrelated payments in 2017 as in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in 2017 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 primarily relates to 47 billion of proceeds net of divested cash and transaction costs from the contribution of our global coffee businesses to jde the divestiture of agf and the cash receipt of 10 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our coffee business transactions in 2015 

capital expenditures were 1014 million in 2017 1224 million in 2016 and 1514 million in 2015 we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2018 capital expenditures to be up to 10 billion including capital expenditures in connection with our 20142018 restructuring program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 3361 million in 2017 1862 million in 2016 and 5883 million in 2015 the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2017 relative to 2016 was primarily due to lower net issuances of shortterm and longterm debt as well as an increase in dividends paid partly offset by lower common stock repurchases compared to the prior year the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 was primarily due to higher shortterm debt issuances and 10 billion of lower share repurchases following the exceptional year of share repurchases using proceeds from the global coffee business transactions in 2015 

debt 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  for details of our tender offers debt issuances and maturities during 20162017 the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors due to seasonality in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the second half of the year typically generates higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital needs 

during 2016 one of our subsidiaries mondelez international holdings netherlands bv “mihn” issued debt totaling 45 billion the operations held by mihn generated approximately 745 or 193 billion of the 259 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2017 and represented approximately 755 or 198 billion of the 262 billion of net assets as of december 31 2017 

on february 3 2017 our board of directors approved a new 5 billion longterm financing authority to replace the prior authority as of december 31 2017 we had 47 billion of longterm financing authority remaining 

 

in the next 12 months we expect 12 billion of longterm debt will mature as follows fr250 million swiss franc notes 257 million as of december 31 2017 in january 2018 478 million in february 2018 £76 million sterling notes 103 million as of december 31 2017 in july 2018 and 322 million in august 2018 we expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or longterm debt 

our total debt was 177 billion at december 31 2017 and 172 billion at december 31 2016 our debttocapitalization ratio was 040 at december 31 2017 and 041 at december 31 2016 at december 31 2017 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 62 years our average daily commercial borrowings were 44 billion in 2017 22 billion in 2016 and 22 billion in 2015 we had 34 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december 31 2017 and 24 billion outstanding as of december 31 2016 we expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short and longterm financing needs and to continue to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  for more information on our debt and debt covenants 

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production during 2017 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currencyrelated costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for dairy cocoa sugar packaging and other raw materials 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes such as dairy where there is a limited ability to hedge and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2018 while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 12 commitments and contingencies  we enter into thirdparty guarantees primarily to cover the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of these transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2017 we had no material thirdparty guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we use nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have detailed the nongaap adjustments that we make in our nongaap definitions below the adjustments generally fall within the following categories acquisition  divestiture activities gains and losses on intangible asset sales and noncash impairments major program restructuring activities constant currency and related adjustments major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results we believe the nongaap measures should always be considered along with the related us gaap financial measures we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and nongaap financial measures below and we also discuss our underlying gaap results throughout our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k 

our primary nongaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prioryear operating results as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change when our definitions change we provide the updated definitions and present the related nongaap historical results on a comparable basis 1  

 

    

  

  

           we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures vary among companies the nongaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k 

 

organic net revenue 

applying the definition of “organic net revenue” the adjustments made to “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impact of currency our historical venezuelan operations the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business an accounting calendar change acquisitions and divestitures we believe that organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results we also evaluate our organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and power brands and these underlying measures are also reconciled to us gaap below 

 

  

    

adjusted operating income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 8 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by reportable segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results for additional information on the impact of currency policies recent currency devaluations the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—currency translation and highly inflationary accounting 

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions to manage input cost volatility we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads london interbank offered rates “libor” euro interbank offered rate “euribor” and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt was 21 as of december 31 2017 down from 22 as of december 31 2016 

there were no significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between 

december 31 2016 and december 31 2017 see note 8 financial instruments  for more information on 2017 and 2018 derivative activity 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2017 and 2016 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2016 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

we manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets our regional management teams have responsibility for the business product categories and financial results in the regions 

we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends for a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pretax earnings as well as other information on our segments see note 16 segment reporting  

our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were 

 



our segment operating income for each of the last three years was 

 



the deconsolidation of our global coffee business in 2015 the deconsolidation of our venezuela operations beginning with our 2016 results currency and other items significantly affect the comparability of our consolidated and segment operating results from year to year please see management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a review of our operating results 

our brands span five product categories 

     during 2016 our segments contributed to our net revenues in the following product categories 

 



 

within our product categories the classes of products that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net revenues were 

 



 

 significant divestitures and acquisitions 

for information on our significant divestitures and acquisitions please refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions and specifically in connection with our global coffee business deconsolidation see the discussions under jde coffee business transactions and keurig transaction  

customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2016 our five largest customers accounted for 166 and our ten largest customers accounted for 229 of net revenues from continuing operations in 2016 

seasonality 

demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events depending on when easter falls there may also be a shift between the first and second quarter results we build inventory based on expected demand and typically fill customer orders within a few days of receipt so the backlog of unfilled orders is not material funding for working capital items including inventory and receivables is normally sourced from operating cash flows and shortterm commercial paper borrowings for additional information on our liquidity working capital management cash flow and financing activities see liquidity and capital resources  note 1  summary of significant accounting policies and note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  appearing later in this 10k filing 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and investment time horizons than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures we believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position 

distribution and marketing 

across our segments we generally sell our products to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

we also sell our products on a growing number of ecommerce platforms as consumer consumption patterns change reflecting greater consumer time compression and technology use and retail increasingly expands online within our digital and social marketing we create opportunities for consumers to easily find and buy our products online we have built relationships with several retailers to develop customized programs that fit their and our formats and provide consumers additional personalized offerings from our snacks portfolio 

 

we conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing and advertising including onair print outdoor digital and social media and other product promotions ii consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat corn products palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources for additional information on our commodity costs refer to the commodity trends section within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights including trademarks patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets technology and knowhow are material to our business 

we own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world depending on the country trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms we also have patents for a number of current and potential products our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture sale or distribution of third party products similarly we sell some products under brands we license from third parties in our agreement with kraft foods group inc “kraft foods group” which is now part of the kraft heinz company we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spinoff of our north american grocery business 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends wellness products and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives these initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation platforms power brands and breakthrough technologies in september 2016 we announced our plan to invest 65 million over 20172018 to build out and modernize our network of global research and development facilities we are focusing our technical resources at nine large locations to drive global growth and innovation these global hubs will enable greater effectiveness improved efficiency and accelerated project delivery these locations are in curitiba brazil suzhou china thane india mexico city mexico east hanover new jersey wroclaw poland jurong singapore bournville united kingdom and reading united kingdom 

 

at december 31 2016 we had approximately 2550 scientists and engineers of which approximately 1950 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs our research and development expense was 376 million in 2016 409 million in 2015 and 455 million in 2014 our total research and development expense was lower in 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our global coffee business in july 2015 currency and cost optimization initiatives 

regulation 

our food products and ingredients are subject to local national and multinational regulations related to labeling packaging pricing marketing and advertising privacy and related areas in addition various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities enforcing standards for selected food products grading food products and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention and the scrutiny of human rights issues in industry supply chains has led to developing regulation in many countries these policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review 

examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes labeling requirements such as nutrient profiling marketing restrictions potential withdrawal of trade concessions as dispute settlement retaliation and sanctions on sales or sourcing of raw materials we will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material also refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  for additional information on government regulations and currencyrelated impacts on our operations in the united kingdom argentina and other countries 

environmental regulation 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act based on information currently available we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

sustainability 

a key strategic goal for us is to grow our impact and we seek to do that in part by sourcing our products sustainably reducing the environmental impact of our operations and packaging and being mindful of the limited resources available around the world we continue to leverage our global operating scale to secure sustainable raw materials and work with suppliers to drive meaningful social and environmental changes focusing on where we can make the most impact for example we have taken direct accountability for building a sustainable cocoa supply with our 400 million cocoa life program and we’re improving sustainability in our wheat supply by working with farmers in north america and through our harmony program in europe 

our 2020 sustainability goals aim to place us at the forefront in the fight against climate change with ambitious targets for an endtoend approach to reduce our carbon footprint including reducing our absolute co 2 emissions from manufacturing and addressing deforestation in key raw material supply chains we are also working to cut our absolute water footprint in manufacturing focusing on priority sites where water is most scarce and we are working to reduce waste in manufacturing and packaging 

we have been recognized for our ongoing economic environmental and social contributions and this year were listed again on the dow jones sustainability index “djsi” – world and north american indices the djsi selects the top 10 of global companies and top 20 of north american companies based on an extensive review of financial and sustainability programs within each industry we improved our overall score to reach the 95 th percentile of our industry and achieved perfect scores in health and nutrition raw material sourcing and waterrelated risks 

 

we also participate in the cdp climate and water disclosures and continue to work to reduce our carbon and water footprints we ranked 4 th in the access to nutrition index a global index that assesses and ranks the world’s largest food and beverage companies on their nutritionrelated commitments practices and performance we are committed to continue this and other related work in the areas of sustainable resources and agriculture mindful snacking community partnerships and safety of our products and people 

employees 

we employed through our consolidated subsidiaries approximately 90000 people worldwide at december 31 2016 and approximately 99000 at december 31 2015 employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 65 of our 78000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 12000 us employees our business units are subject to various local national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees in accordance with european union requirements we also have established a european workers council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we or our subsidiaries are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and we work to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire 

international operations 

based on where we sell our products we generated 756 of our 2016 net revenues 787 of our 2015 net revenues and 821 of our 2014 net revenues from continuing operations outside the united states we sell our products to consumers in approximately 165 countries at december 31 2016 we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 150 manufacturing and processing facilities in 52 countries refer to note 16 segment reporting for additional information on our us and nonus operations refer to item 2 properties  for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities also for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states see “risk factors” in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include major international food snack and beverage companies that like us operate in multiple geographic areas as well as numerous local and regional companies we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price if we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively assess timely change and set proper pricing or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our strategic and financial goals the rapid emergence of new distribution channels such as ecommerce may create consumer price deflation affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases we may need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share these expenditures might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

in addition companies in our industry are under increasing pressure to improve the efficiency of their overall cost structures we are pursuing a transformation agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio improving our cost structure and operating model and accelerating our growth if we do not achieve these objectives or do not implement transformation in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms including ecommerce and expand our brand image with new and renewed product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and both product renovation and innovation failure to effectively address the continuing global focus on wellbeing including weight management changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients and increasing attention from the media shareholders consumers activists and other stakeholders on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image undue caution on our part in addressing these challenges could weaken our competitive position such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us product quality and safety where we manufacture our products or environmental and human and workplace rights risks in our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations our sponsorship relationships could also subject us to negative publicity 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions limit how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain extend and expand our brand image particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts comments or activities could seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image and our marketing efforts might not achieve desired results as a result we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill furthermore third parties may sell counterfeit or spurious versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks if that happens consumers could confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand causing consumers to refrain from purchasing our brands if we do not successfully maintain extend and expand our reputation and brand image then our brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 756 of our 2016 net revenues 787 of our 2015 net revenues and 821 of our 2014 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in approximately 165 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries therefore we are subject to risks inherent in global operations those risks include 

 

        

     in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand high unemployment or the slowdown in economic growth in some markets could constrain consumer spending as a branded food company that seeks to sell our products at a premium declining consumer purchasing power could result in loss of market share and adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the dynamics and uncertainties associated with the united kingdom’s vote to exit the european union “brexit” including currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility in global stock markets could have a negative effect on our business all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition results of operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or long term 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including among others brazil china india mexico russia argentina ukraine the middle east africa and southeast asia however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries particularly those with emerging economies engaging in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws may be more common these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to achieving our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected such as occurred when we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan operations at the close of 2015 or any potential impact on our business in venezuela from future economic or political developments 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers and material needs owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions terrorism political unrest generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers and the quality and safety of our products might be negatively affected if that occurs we may lose our customers’ confidence or suffer damage to our reputation and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition we might not have the functions processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth further our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint may be negatively impacted by portfolio complexity changes in volume produced and changes to regulatory restrictions or laborrelated constraints on our ability to adjust production capacity in the markets in which we operate these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2016 we sold our products in approximately 165 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries consequently a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and to pay dividends to our shareholders in addition movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions but our efforts may not be successful accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat corn products palm and other vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses prices for these raw materials other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations political conditions severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs increasing focus on climate change deforestation water animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased activism focusing on consumer goods companies government intervention and consumer response and could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers who might lack the capacity to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products including increases to cover higher input costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices or if we are limited by supply constraints our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

complying with changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production storage distribution sales advertising labeling and marketing as well as licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations for instance our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by the regulatory and economic impact of changes in taxation and trade relations among the united states and other countries or changes in the european union such as brexit 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness 

 

we also face increased personnelrelated risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda related to our operating model and business processes including building a global shared services capability and reconfiguring our supply chain these risks could lead to operational challenges including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals higher employee turnover including of employees with key capabilities and challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to build and effectively execute a shared services function and transform our business processes furthermore we might be unable to manage appropriately changes in or that affect our workforce or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 65 of our 78000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 12000 us employees strikes work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest by our employees or those of our suppliers or distributors or situations like the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements covering eight us facilities that expired in february 2016 could cause disruptions to our supply chain manufacturing or distribution processes 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our retail customers are consolidating and we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and our other major markets continue to consolidate or form buying alliances resulting in fewer larger customers with whom we can conduct business large retail customers and customer alliances can resist our efforts to increase prices delist our products or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs longer payment terms or specifically tailored products retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive the difference in the quality or value between our products and the retailer or other economy brands has narrowed if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer the retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or we may need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

if we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers 

during 2016 our five largest customers accounted for 166 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

additionally disputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product mislabeling or product tampering in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations or those of our suppliers violate applicable laws or regulations or if our or our suppliers’ products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action a widespread product recall or attempts to manipulate us based on threats related to the safety of our products could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations moreover our failure to maintain effective control environment processes including in connection with the development of our global shared services capability could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures equity method investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners in addition execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and similar strategic alliances pose additional risks as we share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more other parties who may not have the same objectives priorities strategies or resources as we do strategic alliances we have entered into include combining our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of de master blenders 1753 bv “demb” to create a new company jacobs douwe egberts “jde” in july 2015 and exchanging a portion of our equity ownership in jde for equity in the new holding company of keurig green mountain inc “keurig” in march 2016 transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and nonfinancial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits depending on the nature of the business ventures including whether they operate globally these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are including political economic and regulatory risks currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility of commodity and other input prices either partner might fail to recognize alliance relationships that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected 

 

furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products that meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging sales channel and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences moreover weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other factors could affect consumer preferences and demand if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those changing preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base including by geography we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health environmental and social implications of certain food products and ingredients could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers have increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sodium and added sugar consumption in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we could fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis as a result our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

we increasingly rely on information technology and third party service providers 

we rely on information technology and third party service providers to process transmit and store company information via business applications internal networks and the internet we use these technologies and third party service providers to support our global business processes and activities including communicating with our employees customers and suppliers running critical business operations engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions conducting research and development activities meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities 

 

working with these technologies and third party service providers creates risks related to confidentiality integrity and continuity and some of these risks may be outside of our control confidentiality and integrity of information may be jeopardized by deliberate or unintentional misuse manipulation or disclosure of information physical theft or cybersecurity data breaches by our employees suppliers hackers criminal groups nationstate organizations socialactivist organizations or other third parties we currently utilize third party ecommerce providers and request that they have the appropriate cybersecurity controls and meet regulatory requirements going forward should we decide to transact ecommerce direct to consumers as the merchant we would implement additional procedures controls and technology to address cybersecurity and regulatory compliance we might face increased risk if new initiatives such as ecommerce increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain and the cybersecurity and compliance controls we or our third party providers implement are not effective continuity of business applications and services may be disrupted by errors in systems’ maintenance migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures viruses or malware denial of service and other cyber security attacks telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events 

should any of these risks materialize the need to coordinate with various third party service providers might complicate our efforts to resolve the related issues if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we may experience delays in reporting our financial results 

in addition should confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners suppliers or governmental or regulatory authorities be misused or breached we may suffer financial losses relating to remediation damage to our reputation or brands loss of intellectual property or penalties or litigation related to violation of data privacy laws and regulations 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our short and longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry could affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates our participation in multiemployer pension plans or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world at the end of 2016 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 114 billion and plan assets were 95 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our largest funded defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate and government debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate the viability of other employers in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation 

 

volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we are required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost 

due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans we may have exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees our contributions to a multiemployer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multiemployer plan we may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer and our costs might increase as a result further if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability this withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates see note 9 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could curtail our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our failure to protect our valuable intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations

coffee business transactions 

jde coffee business transactions 

on july 2 2015 we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of demb to create a new company jde at that time our equity interest in jde was 435 with the remaining 565 held by a subsidiary of acorn holdings bv “ahbv” owner of demb prior to july 2 2015 in connection with these transactions in 2015 we recorded a final pretax gain of 68 billion 66 billion aftertax from the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee businesses we also recorded approximately 10 billion of cumulative pretax net gains 436 million in 2015 and 628 million in 2014 and cash related to currency hedging in connection with the expected cash consideration to be received in euros we received € 38 billion of cash 42 billion as of july 2 2015 and with the cash from hedging currency we effectively received 52 billion of cash on july 5 2016 we also received from jde an expected 275 million cash payment to settle a receivable for tax formation costs that were part of the initial sales price as part of our final sales price negotiations we also retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an agreed amount in the future as such we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future as further described below following the march 2016 exchange of jde shares for an investment in keurig and stockbased compensation activity at jde during 2016 as of december 31 2016 our equity interest in jde was 264 we recorded equity earnings of 100 million in 2016 and equity losses of 58 million in 2015 related to our investment in jde

see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions for additional details on the jde coffee business transactions

coffee business equity earnings 

we have reflected the results of our historical coffee businesses and equity earnings from jde keurig and dongsuh foods corporation “dsf” in our results from continuing operations as the coffee category continues to be a significant part of our net earnings and business strategy going forward historically our coffee businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were part of our base business while we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including jde keurig and dsf and we have significant influence with our equity method investments we do not control these operations directly as such in the third quarter of 2015 we began to recognize equity method investment earnings consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses outside of operating income for periods prior to the third quarter of 2015 our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating income see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions for more information 

venezuela deconsolidation 

effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year we concluded that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our venezuelan operations and an otherthantemporary lack of currency exchangeability at that time we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan operations we recorded a 778 million pretax loss on december 31 2015 as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in venezuela and all venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value resulting in full impairment the recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity 

as of the start of 2016 we no longer include net revenues earnings or net assets of our venezuelan subsidiaries within our consolidated financial statements in our reported gaap results we exclude venezuela in our nongaap results for all historical periods presented under the cost method of accounting earnings are only recognized to the extent cash is received and we have not received any distributed cash from our venezuela operations in 2016 given the current and ongoing difficult economic regulatory and business environment in venezuela there continues to be significant uncertainty related to our operations in venezuela and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future we monitor the extent of our ability to control our venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of cash and us dollars needed to operate in venezuela as our current situation in venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date see discussion and analysis of historical results – items affecting comparability of financial results below and note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting venezuela  for more information on our historical venezuelan operating results including the remeasurement losses and loss on deconsolidation 

summary of results 

 

  

  

  

 financial outlook 

we seek to achieve profitable longterm growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps we use these nongaap financial metrics and related computations such as margins internally to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near and longterm operating and strategic decisions as such we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our us gaap financial results we believe providing investors with the same financial information that we use internally ensures that investors have the same data to make comparisons of our historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and gain additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we believe our nongaap financial measures should always be considered in relation to our gaap results and we have provided reconciliations between our gaap and nongaap financial measures in nongaap financial measures which appears later in this section 

in addition to monitoring our key operating metrics we monitor a number of developments or trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets over the longterm we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in consumer behaviors such as migration to more frequent smaller meals and snacks and greater use of convenience foods in the near term low gdp growth economic recessionary pressures weak consumer confidence a strong us dollar and changing consumer trends have slowed category and our net revenue growth we recognize these factors and the changing consumer trends such as the increasing emphasis on wellbeing time compression growing income disparity digital revolution and an evolving retail landscape and we are investing in our wellbeing snacks portfolio product and marketing innovation and new routes to market including ecommerce to position ourselves for future growth 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products growth in these global categories excluding venezuela decreased from approximately 34 in 2015 to 24 in 2016 over the longterm we expect category growth to improve when the macroeconomic environment improves we continue to make investments in our brand portfolio and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets in doing so we anticipate driving demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations particularly in emerging markets some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and sensitivity to world oil and energy prices as we noted this past year in markets including brazil russia india china ukraine the middle east and nigeria volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business we expect continued volatility across our markets particularly emerging markets as such we are focused on investing in our global power brands and routes to market while we protect our margins through the management of costs and pricing 

 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on meeting consumer needs and preferences through new product innovations and product quality we also continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

pricing – we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions in 2015 and 2016 we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs currency and other market factors in 2017 we anticipate that we will adjust our prices in response to changing market conditions price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning we also continue to work on programs to expand our profitability and margins such as our 20142018 restructuring program which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs we also integrated our eemea business into our europe and asia pacific segments effective october 1 2016 we expect this change to have a favorable impact on our operating performance prospectively due to greater leverage of our european and amea regional businesses and resulting cost structure we also began to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements covering eight us facilities that expired in february 2016 we continue to work toward reaching a new agreement and have plans to ensure business continuity during the renegotiations 

currency – as a global company with 756 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements in the last three years the us dollar has generally strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate and several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency these currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations our 2016 net revenues were 259 billion down 125 from 2015 including a negative 46 percentage point impact from currency translation our 2015 net revenues were 296 billion down 135 from 2014 including a negative 126 percentage point impact from currency translation and a 120 percentage point impact excluding currency impacts related to venezuela our 2014 net revenues were 342 billion down 30 from 2013 including a negative 52 percentage point impact from currency translation and a 39 percentage point impact excluding currency impacts related to venezuela 

we have historically been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly but not only in connection with our venezuela operations that were deconsolidated at the close of the 2015 fiscal year in the months following brexit there was significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rates affecting the markets in which we conduct business the value of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar declined significantly with further volatility in the exchange rate expected over the brexit transition period the devaluation of the british pound sterling negatively affected our translated results reported in us dollars to partially offset the translation of certain of our overseas operations including the united kingdom we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency denominated debt we generally do not hedge against currency translation and primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on crosscurrency transactions due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our crosscurrency transaction risks the local economies monetary policies and currency hedging availability can affect our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses while we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks factors such as continued global and local market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty limited hedging opportunities and other factors could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future while we continue to monitor and work to safeguard our business brexit could adversely affect future demand for our products our financial results and operations and our relationships with customers suppliers and employees in the short or longterm we may not be able to fully offset the increased risks related to brexit which could impact profitability in the nearterm or longer should these conditions continue see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting venezuela and united kingdom for related information  

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lowercost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases during 2016 we retired 62 billion of our longterm debt and related costs and issued lowercost longterm euro swiss franc and us dollardenominated debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2016 was 22 down from 37 as of december 31 2015 and down from 43 as of december 31 2014 refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  for additional debt activity in 2017

net revenues – net revenues decreased 3713 million 125 to 25923 million in 2016 and organic net revenue 1 increased 360 million 13 to 27067 million power brands net revenues decreased 118 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business unfavorable currency and the deconsolidation of our historical venezuelan operations and power brands organic net revenue increased 28 emerging markets net revenues decreased 191 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our historical venezuelan operations unfavorable currency and the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business and emerging markets organic net revenue increased 27 the underlying changes in net revenues and organic net revenue are detailed below 

 



 

    

net revenue decline of 125 was driven by the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business unfavorable currency the deconsolidation of our historical venezuelan operations and the yearoveryear impact of the 2015 accounting calendar change partially offset by our underlying organic net revenue growth of 13 and the impact of acquisitions the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 1627 million for 2016 unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by 1244 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to several currencies including the argentinean peso british pound sterling mexican peso brazilian real chinese yuan and russian ruble the deconsolidation of our historical venezuelan operations resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 1217 million for 2016 the north america segment accounting calendar change in 2015 resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 76 million for 2016 our underlying organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing partially offset by unfavorable volume  mix net pricing was up which includes the benefit of carryover pricing from 2015 as well as the effects of input costdriven pricing actions taken during 2016 higher net pricing was reflected in latin america and amea partially offset by lower net pricing in europe and north america unfavorable volume  mix was reflected in latin america and amea mostly offset by favorable volume  mix in europe and north america unfavorable volume  mix in latin america and amea was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain lowmargin product lines the impact of acquisitions primarily includes the july 15 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in vietnam which added 71 million of incremental net revenues for 2016 and the november 2 2016 purchase of a license to manufacture market and sell cadburybranded biscuits in additional key markets which added 16 million of incremental net revenues for 2016

       during 2016 we realized higher net pricing while input costs increased modestly higher net pricing which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2015 was reflected in latin america and amea partially offset by lower net pricing in europe and north america the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials which were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity unfavorable volume  mix was driven by latin america and amea which was mostly offset by favorable volume  mix in europe and north america 

total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 1037 million from 2015 due to a number of factors noted in the table above including in part the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business a favorable currency impact lower costs associated with the jde coffee business transactions the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations gains on the sales of property vatrelated settlements and the absence of devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in venezuela in 2016 the decreases were partially offset by increases from divestiturerelated costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in france the reclassification of equity method investment earnings higher implementation costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program and the impact of acquisitions 

excluding the factors noted above selling general and administrative expenses decreased 322 million from 2015 the decrease was driven primarily by lower overhead costs due to continued cost reduction efforts 

we recorded a benefit of 54 million in 2016 from vatrelated settlements in latin america as compared to 30 million in 2015 unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by 176 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most currencies including the british pound sterling argentinean peso and mexican peso

operating income margin decreased from 300 in 2015 to 99 in 2016 the decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by last year’s pretax gain on the jde coffee business transactions the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations the unfavorable yearoveryear change in marktomarket gains  losses from derivatives higher costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program divestiturerelated costs associated with the planned sale of a confectionery business in france higher intangible asset impairment charges and the reclassification of equity method earnings the items that decreased our operating income margin were partially offset by the prioryear loss on the venezuela deconsolidation an increase in our adjusted operating income margin and the absence of costs associated with the jde coffee business transactions adjusted operating income margin increased from 130 in 2015 to 153 in 2016 the increase in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by lower overheads from cost reduction programs improved gross margin reflecting productivity efforts gains on sales of property and vatrelated settlements

       during 2015 higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs higher net pricing due to inputcost driven pricing actions taken during the year was reflected across all segments the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials partially offset by lower manufacturing costs unfavorable volume  mix was reflected across all segments

excluding the factors noted above selling general and administrative expenses increased 321 million from 2014 the increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotions support particularly behind our power brands

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets 

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead quantitative impairment testing consists of a twostep evaluation the first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for our europe and north america reporting units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 67 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america and amea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 97 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we would apply a second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill 

on october 1 2016 we integrated our eemea operating segment into our europe and asia pacific operating segments as a result eemea goodwill of 13 billion was reallocated to new reporting units based on the relative fair value of the eemea component businesses that moved to the europe and asia pacific segments goodwill by segment as of december 31 2016 reflects the results of the reallocation and the december 31 2015 goodwill by segment information was recast to reflect the october 1 2016 reallocation of goodwill 

on july 2 2015 we deconsolidated our global coffee businesses from our europe and amea segments goodwill was deconsolidated from the impacted reporting units based on relative fair values of the coffee and remaining businesses intangible assets contributed with the coffee business transactions were specifically identified we deconsolidated total goodwill of 1664 million and intangible assets of less than 1 million during the third quarter of 2015 refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions – jde coffee business transactions  for more information 

in 2016 2015 and 2014 there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

annually we assess nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value we determine estimated fair value using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

 

during our 2016 annual testing of nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded 98 million of impairment charges related to five trademarks the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other regional and global brands as well as slowdowns in local economies we recorded charges related to biscuits candy and gum trademarks of 41 million in amea 32 million in north america 22 million in europe and 3 million in latin america the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method which utilizes estimates of future sales growth rates royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value during our 2016 intangible asset impairment review we noted nine brands including the five impaired trademarks with 630 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2016 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less while these other four intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired if planned business performance expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future in 2015 we recorded a charge related to candy and biscuit trademarks of 44 million in our amea segment 22 million in europe and 5 million in latin america additionally in connection with the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations on december 31 2015 we recorded 12 million of impairment charges within the loss on deconsolidation of venezuela related to a biscuit trademark in 2014 we recorded a 48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our amea segment and a 9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our europe segment 

refer to note 5 goodwill and intangible assets  for additional information 

trade and marketing programs 

we promote our products with advertising marketing sales incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to cooperative advertising instore displays consumer promotions new product introduction fees discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and estimated program spending we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits for accounting purposes we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates expected returns on plan assets expected compensation increases employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality and health care cost trends we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses as many of our pension plans are partially funded the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 9 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2017 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease on our annual benefit plan costs

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the amount recognized in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or due to expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events such as material changes in longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our 45 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program international credit lines and longterm debt issuances for regular funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility earnings outside of the united states are considered indefinitely reinvested and no material tax liability has been accrued as of december 31 2016 overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the united states 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 2838 million in 2016 3728 million in 2015 and 3562 million in 2014 cash flows from operating activities were lower in 2016 than 2015 due to higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2016 and higher working capital cash improvements in 2015 than in 2016 cash flows from operating activities in all years were favorably impacted by working capital improvements primarily due to continually decreasing our cash conversion cycle a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding to negative 28 days in 2016 negative 12 days in 2015 and positive 10 days in 2014 cash flows from operating activities were favorable in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily due to higher relative working capital cash improvements than in 2014 and significant tax payments in 2014 related to the 26 billion starbucks arbitration award we received in late 2013 partially offset by higher contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2015 

net cash provided by  used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1029 million in 2016 net cash provided by investing activities was 2649 million in 2015 and net cash used in investing activities was 1642 million in 2014 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 and the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily relate to 47 billion of proceeds net of divested cash and transaction costs from the contribution of our global coffee businesses the divestiture of agf and the cash receipt of 10 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our coffee business transactions in 2015 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 is partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2016 of 290 million the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 is also driven by lower capital expenditures in 2015 of 128 million partially offset by the 611 million reduction of cash due to the venezuela deconsolidation 501 million of contributed jde receivables and a 43 million cash payment to fund a capital increase in jde and 527 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in vietnam and the enjoy life foods snack food business in 2015 

capital expenditures were 1224 million in 2016 1514 million in 2015 and 1642 million in 2014 we continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2017 capital expenditures to be up to 12 billion including capital expenditures in connection with our 20142018 restructuring program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 1862 million in 2016 5883 million in 2015 and 2688 million in 2014 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 was primarily due to higher net shortterm debt issuances and 10 billion of lower share repurchases following the exceptional year of share repurchases using proceeds from the global coffee business transactions in 2015 the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to higher repayments of longterm debt in 2015 including the tender offers and euro notes maturities 19 billion of higher share repurchases and higher net shortterm debt repayments partially offset by higher proceeds received from longterm note issuances 

debt 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  for details of our tender offers debt issuances and maturities during 2016 2015 and 2014 the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors due to seasonality in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital needs 

 

during 2016 one of our subsidiaries mondelez international holdings netherlands bv “mihn” issued debt totaling 45 billion the operations held by mihn generated approximately 741 percent or 192 billion of the 259 billion of consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2016 and represented approximately 817 percent or 206 billion of the 252 billion of net assets as of december 31 2016 

on february 3 2017 our board of directors approved a new 5 billion longterm financing authority to replace the prior authority 

in the next 12 months we expect 14 billion of longterm debt will mature as follows € 750 million 789 million as of december 31 2016 in january 2017 fr 175 million swiss franc notes 172 million as of december 31 2016 in march 2017 and 488 million in august 2017 we expect to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or longterm debt 

our total debt was 172 billion at december 31 2016 and 154 billion at december 31 2015 our debttocapitalization ratio was 041 at december 31 2016 and 035 at december 31 2015 at december 31 2016 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 66 years our average daily commercial borrowings were 22 billion in 2016 22 billion in 2015 and 19 billion in 2014 we had 24 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december 31 2016 and none outstanding as of december 31 2015 as commercial paper interest rates continued to be favorable in late 2016 and we had a bond maturity refinanced with commercial paper in december 2016 we expect to continue to use commercial paper borrowings to finance various short or longterm financing needs we expect to continue to use commercial paper to finance various short and longterm financing needs and to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  for more information on our debt and debt covenants 

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production during 2016 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currencyrelated costs on our commodity purchases and increased costs for packaging and other raw materials partially offset by lower costs for nuts dairy energy sugar grains and oils and cocoa 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2017 while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 12 commitments and contingencies  we enter into thirdparty guarantees primarily to cover the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of these transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2016 we had no material thirdparty guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

in addition at december 31 2016 we were contingently liable for 758 million of guarantees related to our own performance these include letters of credit surety bonds and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity 

aggregate contractual obligations

share repurchases 

see note 11 capital stock  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share repurchase programs 

we intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases on july 29 2015 our finance committee with authorization delegated from our board of directors approved an increase of 60 billion in the share repurchase program raising the authorization to 137 billion of common stock repurchases and extended the program through december 31 2018 we repurchased 108 billion of shares 26 billion in 2016 36 billion in 2015 19 billion in 2014 and 27 billion in 2013 through december 31 2016 the number of shares that we ultimately repurchase under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors including share price and other market conditions our ongoing capital allocation planning levels of cash and debt balances other demands for cash such as acquisition activity general economic or business conditions and board and management discretion additionally our share repurchase activity during any particular period may fluctuate we may accelerate suspend delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time without notice 

dividends 

we paid dividends of 1094 million in 2016 1008 million in 2015 and 964 million in 2014 on july 19 2016 our board of directors approved a 12 increase in the quarterly dividend to 019 per common share or 076 per common share on an annual basis on july 23 2015 our board of directors approved a 13 increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to 017 per common share or 068 per common share on an annual basis on august 5 2014 our audit committee with authorization from our board of directors approved a 7 increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to 015 per common share or 060 per common share on an annual basis the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

for us income tax purposes only the company has calculated that 100 of the distributions paid to its shareholders in january 2016 are characterized as a qualified dividend paid from us earnings and profits the distributions the company paid to its shareholders in april july and october are characterized as a return of capital to each shareholder up to the extent of the shareholder’s tax basis if a shareholder does not have sufficient tax basis these distributions could result in taxable gains to the shareholder shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends including distributions in excess of our us earnings and profits 

 

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business we use nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have detailed the nongaap adjustments that we make in our nongaap definitions below the adjustments generally fall within the following categories acquisition  divestiture activities gains and losses on intangible asset sales and noncash impairments major program restructuring activities constant currency and related adjustments major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results we believe the nongaap measures should always be considered along with the related us gaap financial measures we have provided the reconciliations between the gaap and nongaap financial measures below and we also discuss our underlying gaap results throughout our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form 10k 

our primary nongaap financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prioryear operating results as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change when our definitions change we provide the updated definitions and present the related nongaap historical results on a comparable basis 

 

    

  

  

        we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures vary among companies the nongaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k 

 

organic net revenue 

applying the definition of “organic net revenue” the adjustments made to “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impact of currency our historical venezuelan operations the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business an accounting calendar change acquisitions and divestiture we believe that organic net revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results we also evaluate our organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and power brands and these underlying measures are also reconciled to us gaap below 

 

  

  

    

adjusted operating income 

applying the definition of “adjusted operating income” the adjustments made to “operating income” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude spinoff costs 20122014 restructuring program costs 20142018 restructuring program costs venezuela historical operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses the jde coffee business transactions gain and net incremental costs operating income from our historical coffee business equity method investment earnings reclassified to aftertax earnings in q3 2015 in connection with the coffee business transactions operating results of the agf divestiture pretax gains on the agf and costa rica confectionery business divestitures divestiturerelated costs incurred for the planned sale of a confectionery business in france gain on sale of an intangible asset impairment charges related to intangible assets the integration program and other acquisition integration costs acquisitionrelated costs and marktomarket impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts we also present “adjusted operating income margin” which is subject to the same adjustments as adjusted operating income and evaluate adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis we believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results 

 



 



 

            

adjusted eps 

applying the definition of “adjusted eps” 1  the adjustments made to “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude spinoff costs 20122014 restructuring program costs 20142018 restructuring program costs venezuela historical operating results and deconsolidation and remeasurement losses the jde coffee business transactions gain hedging gains and incremental costs net earnings from the agf divestiture aftertax gain on the costa rica confectionery business divestiture and aftertax loss on the agf divestiture divestiturerelated costs incurred for the planned sale of a confectionery business in france gain on sale of intangible asset impairment charges related to intangible assets acquisition integration costs acquisitionrelated costs marktomarket impacts from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts a loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans gain on the equity method investment exchange and our proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our jde and keurig equity method investees we also evaluate adjusted eps on a constant currency basis we believe adjusted eps provides improved comparability of underlying operating results 

 



 



 

          




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 8 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by reportable segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results for additional information on the impact of currency policies brexit recent currency devaluations the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—currency translation and highly inflationary accounting 

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions to manage input cost volatility we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads london interbank offered rates “libor” euro interbank offered rate “euribor” and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions in addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments during 2016 we retired 62 billion of our longterm debt and related costs and issued 64 billion of lower borrowing cost debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2016 was 22 down from 37 as of december 31 2015 

there were no significant changes in the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our exposures between december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 see note 8 financial instruments  for more information on 2016 derivative activity 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during the periods presented below the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2016 and 2015 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

 

 the impacts in the 2015 tables above have not been recast to reflect the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee business or venezuela business and the related derivative activity for those businesses as it is impracticable to do so 

this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

     we manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets our regional management teams have responsibility for the business product categories and financial results in the regions 

historically we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business beginning in the third quarter of 2015 to align with the accounting for our deconsolidated coffee business and related investment in jde we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in aftertax equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income for the six months ended december 31 2015 aftertax equity method investment net earnings were less than 1 million on a combined basis earnings from equity method investments through july 2 2015 recorded within segment operating income were 49 million in asia pacific 3 million in eemea and 4 million in north america for the year ended december 31 2014 these earnings were 98 million in asia pacific 6 million in eemea and 9 million in north america for the year ended december 31 2013 these earnings were 99 million in asia pacific 7 million in eemea and 1 million in north america see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – principles of consolidation  for additional information 

in 2015 we also began to report stockbased compensation for our corporate employees which was previously reported within our north america region within general corporate expenses we reclassified 32 million of corporate stockbased compensation expense out of the north america segment in 2015 

our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were

significant divestitures and acquisitions 

for information on our significant divestitures and acquisitions please refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions and specifically in connection with our global coffee business deconsolidation see our discussion under coffee business transactions  

customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2015 our five largest customers accounted for 17 and our ten largest customers accounted for 24 of net revenues from continuing operations in 2015 

seasonality 

demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures we believe these investments lead to better products for the consumer and support our growth and market position 

distribution and marketing 

across our segments we generally sell our products to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we also use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

we also sell our products on a growing number of ecommerce platforms as consumer consumption patterns change reflecting greater consumer time compression and technology use and retail increasingly expands online within our digital and social marketing we also create opportunities for consumers to easily find and buy our products online we have built relationships with several retailers to develop customized programs that fit their and our formats and provide consumers additional personalized offerings from our snacks portfolio 

we conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing and advertising including onair print outdoor digital and social media and other product promotions ii consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we regularly monitor worldwide supply cost and currency trends related to these commodities so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and energy sources required for production 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and governmental agricultural programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources for additional information on our commodity costs refer to the commodity trends section within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights including trademarks patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets technology and knowhow are material to our business

we own numerous trademarks and patents in many countries around the world depending on the country trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms we also have patents for a number of current and potential products our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business

from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture sale or distribution of third party products similarly we sell some products under brands we license from third parties in our agreement with kraft foods group inc “kraft foods group” which is now part of the kraft heinz company we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spinoff of our north american grocery business 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs our innovation efforts focus on anticipating consumer demands and adapting quickly to changing market trends wellness products and healthy snacking are a significant focus of our current research and development initiatives these initiatives aim to accelerate our growth and margins by addressing consumer needs and market trends and leveraging our global innovation platforms power brands and breakthrough technologies 

at december 31 2015 we had approximately 2450 scientists and engineers of which approximately 1900 are primarily focused on research and development and the remainder are primarily focused on quality assurance and regulatory affairs our major technology centers are located in east hanover new jersey whippany new jersey bournville united kingdom curitiba brazil paris france melbourne australia mexico city mexico munich germany reading united kingdom thane india and suzhou china our research and development expense was 409 million in 2015 455 million in 2014 and 471 million in 2013 our total research and development expense was lower in 2015 primarily due to the deconsolidation of our global coffee business currency and cost optimization initiatives 

 

regulation 

our food products and ingredients are subject to local national and multinational regulations related to labeling packaging pricing marketing and advertising privacy and related areas in addition various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing and inspecting our manufacturing plants and facilities enforcing standards for selected food products grading food products and regulating trade practices related to the sale and pricing of our food products many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention these policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review 

examples of laws and regulations that affect our business include selective food taxes nutritional labeling requirements and marketing restrictions in markets such as europe and latin america russian sanctions on the sourcing of raw materials from the european union and potential labeling disclosure requirements for genetically modified ingredients in the united states we will continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with new laws and regulations will be material also refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  for additional information on government regulations and currencyrelated impacts on our operations in argentina russia and other countries 

environmental regulation 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party as of december 31 2015 we had resolved the one active proceeding in the united states under a state equivalent of cercla related to our current operations as of december 31 2015 we accrued an immaterial amount for the remaining payments related to this resolution based on information currently available we believe that our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

employees 

we employed approximately 99000 people worldwide at december 31 2015 and approximately 104000 at december 31 2014 approximately 5000 employees transferred to jde in connection with the global coffee business transactions and we also added approximately 6000 employees due to acquisitions in 2015 employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 65 of our 87000 employees outside the united states and approximately 30 of our 12000 us employees our business units are subject to various local national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees in accordance with european union requirements we also have established a european workers council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe we generally have good relationships with our employees and their representative organizations 

foreign operations 

we generated 787 of our 2015 net revenues 821 of our 2014 net revenues and 831 of our 2013 net revenues from continuing operations outside the united states we sell our products to consumers in 165 countries at december 31 2015 we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 156 manufacturing and processing facilities in 57 countries refer to note 17 segment reporting for additional information on our us and nonus operations refer to item 2 properties  for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities also for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states see “risk factors” in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include major international food snack and beverage companies that like us operate in multiple geographic areas as well as numerous local and regional companies we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price if we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively assess change and set proper pricing may negatively impact the achievement of our strategic and financial goals the emergence of new distribution channels such as internet sales directly to consumers may affect customer and consumer preferences cost structures or margins and we might not achieve our goal of developing and building an industryleading ecommerce snacks business on our planned timeframe we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share these expenditures might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

in addition companies in our industry are under increasing pressure to improve the efficiency of their overall cost structures we have announced a transformation agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio improving our cost structure and operating model and accelerating our growth if we do not achieve these objectives and do so in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms including online and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing attention from the media shareholders consumers activists and other stakeholders on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image undue caution on our part in addressing these challenges could weaken our competitive position such pressures could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us product quality and safety or environmental and human rights risks in our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain extend and expand our brand image particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts comments or activities could seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image as a result we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill if we do not successfully maintain extend and expand our reputation and brand image then our brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 787 of our 2015 net revenues 821 of our 2014 net revenues and 831 of our 2013 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in 165 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries therefore we are subject to risks inherent in global operations those risks include 

 

             

in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including brazil china india mexico russia argentina ukraine the middle east africa and southeast asia however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected such as the current year impact of deconsolidating and changing to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan operations as discussed in this form 10k or any potential impact on our business in venezuela from future economic or political developments 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers and materials needs owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters supply and commodity shortages fire explosions terrorism political unrest generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers’ confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition we might not have the functions processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth further changes to regulatory restrictions within the markets in which we operate may impact our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2015 we sold our products in 165 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and dividends in addition movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions but our efforts may not be successful accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may increase or decrease significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa dairy wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses prices for these raw materials other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations political conditions severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers who might lack the capacity to invest to increase productivity or adapt to changing conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products including increases to cover higher input costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues and earnings if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices or if we are limited by supply constraints our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

changes in and inconsistencies among laws and regulations in many countries in which we operate could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production storage distribution sales advertising and marketing as well as licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness 

we also face increased personnelrelated risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda related to our operating model and business processes including building a global shared services capability these risks could lead to operational challenges including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals higher employee turnover including of employees with key capabilities and challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to build a shared services function and transform our business processes furthermore we might be unable to manage changes in or that affect our workforce appropriately or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 65 of our 87000 employees outside the united states and approximately 30 of our 12000 us employees 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

we must address risks related to consolidation of retail customers and leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and our other major markets continue to consolidate or form buying alliances resulting in fewer but larger customers with whom we can conduct business larger more sophisticated retail customers and alliances among customers can resist price increases delist or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs longer payment terms or specifically tailored products retail customers might also adopt these tactics in their dealings with us in response to the significant growth in online retailing for consumer products which is outpacing the growth of traditional retail channels in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive the difference in the quality or value between our products and the retailer or other economy brands has narrowed if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer the retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

if we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to and may fail to manage changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers 

during 2015 our five largest customers accounted for 170 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers such as the disruptions we experienced in 2014 with customers in france could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

additionally disputes with significant suppliers including those related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers or operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed and deliberate or unintentional product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action or a widespread product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation brands product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

we could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we are a large snack food company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations moreover our failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures minority investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners in addition execution or oversight of strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and strategic alliances pose additional risks as we share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more other parties who may not have the same objectives priorities strategies or resources as we do in july 2015 we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses with those of demb to create a new company jacobs douwe egberts and we acquired an 80 interest in a biscuit operation in vietnam in december 2015 we announced that we intend to exchange a portion of our equity ownership in jde for equity in the new holding company of keurig green mountain inc “keurig” in the event of a successful closing of the acquisition of keurig by an investor group led by jab holding co transactions or ventures into which we enter might not meet our financial and nonfinancial control and compliance expectations or yield the anticipated benefits depending on the nature of the business ventures including whether they operate globally these ventures could also be subject to many of the same risks we are including political economic and regulatory risks currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility of commodity and other input prices either partner might fail to recognize alliance relationships that could expose the business to higher risk or make the venture not as productive as expected furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after we complete a divestiture gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks and challenges could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences moreover weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other factors could affect consumer preferences and demand if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those changing preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base including by geography we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers have increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sodium and added sugar consumption in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect us 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis as a result our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

in connection with management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 we determined that we did not maintain effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness accuracy and presentation of our accounting for income taxes including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities we determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constituted a material weakness as of december 31 2015 we remediated this material weakness see item 9a controls and procedures  for a discussion of the material weakness and the remediation if the new controls we implemented to strengthen our overall internal control over accounting for income taxes were not designed or do not continue to operate effectively or if we are unsuccessful in continuing to follow these new processes we may not timely or accurately report our financial condition or results of operations this could adversely affect our stock price and the confidence of investors business partners and others in our financial reports 

 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and third party service providers 

we rely on information technology and third party service providers to process transmit and store company information via business applications internal networks and the internet we use these technologies to support our global business processes and activities including communicating with our employees customers and suppliers running critical business operations meeting regulatory legal and tax requirements and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities 

these technologies and related information are subject to risks related to confidentiality integrity and continuity many of which are beyond our control confidentiality and integrity of information may be jeopardized by deliberate or unintentional misuse manipulation or disclosure of information physical theft or cybersecurity data breaches we might face increased risk if our goal of increasing our revenues through new initiatives including ecommerce leads to an increase in the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain continuity of business applications and services may be disrupted by errors in systems’ maintenance migration of applications to the cloud power outages hardware or software failures viruses or malware cyber security attacks telecommunication failures natural disasters terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events 

should any of these risks materialize the need to coordinate with various third party service providers might complicate our efforts to resolve the related issues if our controls disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we may experience delays in reporting our financial results 

in addition should confidential information belonging to us or our employees customers consumers partners or suppliers be misused or breached we may suffer financial losses relating to remediation damage to our reputation or brands loss of intellectual property or penalties or litigation related to violation of data privacy laws and regulations 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our short and longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry could affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions and our ability to pay dividends in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates our participation in multiemployer pension plans or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world at the end of 2015 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 111 billion and plan assets were 90 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate the viability of other employers in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation 

volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we are required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net periodic pension cost 

due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans we may have exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees our contributions to a multiemployer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multiemployer plan we may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer and our costs might increase as a result further if we partially or completely withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay a partial or complete withdrawal liability this withdrawal liability will generally increase if there is also a mass withdrawal of other participating employers or if the plan terminates see note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and our failure to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations

coffee business transactions 

on july 2 2015 we completed transactions to combine our wholly owned coffee businesses including our coffee portfolio in france with those of de master blenders 1753 bv “demb” to create a new company jacobs douwe egberts or jde we currently hold a 435 equity interest in jde and acorn holdings bv “ahbv” owner of demb holds the remaining 565 equity interest 

in connection with the contribution of our global coffee businesses to jde we recorded a pretax gain of 68 billion or 66 billion after taxes in 2015 we also recorded approximately 10 billion of pretax net gains related to hedging the expected cash proceeds from the transactions as described further below 

the consideration we have received to date consists of € 38 billion of cash 42 billion us dollars as of july 2 2015 a 435 equity interest in jde and 794 million in receivables related to sales price adjustments and tax formation cost payments during the third quarter of 2015 we also recorded 283 million of cash and receivables from jde related to reimbursement of costs that we incurred in separating our coffee businesses the cash and equity consideration we received at closing reflects that we retained our interest in a koreabased joint venture dongsuh foods corporation during the second quarter of 2015 we also completed the sale of our interest in a japanese coffee joint venture ajinomoto general foods inc “agf” in lieu of contributing our interest in the agf joint venture to jde we contributed the net cash proceeds from the sale and the transaction did not change the consideration received for our global coffee businesses please see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions – other divestitures acquisitions and sales of property  for discussion of the divestiture of agf 

during the fourth quarter we and jde concluded negotiations of a sales price adjustment and completed the valuation of our investment in jde primarily related to the negotiated resolution of the sales price adjustment in the fourth quarter we recorded a 313 million reduction in the pretax gain on the coffee transaction reducing the 71 billion estimated gain in the third quarter to the 68 billion final gain for 2015 as part of our sales price negotiations we retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities come in over an agreed amount in the future as such we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future 

the final value of our investment in jde on july 2 2015 was € 41 billion or 45 billion the fair value of the jde investment was determined using both incomebased and marketbased valuation techniques the discounted cash flow analysis reflected growth discount and tax rates and other assumptions reflecting the underlying combined businesses and countries in which the combined coffee businesses operate 

in connection with the expected receipt of cash in euros at the time of closing we entered into a number of consecutive currency exchange forward contracts in 2014 and 2015 to lock in an equivalent expected value in us dollars as of the date the coffee business transactions were first announced in may 2014 cumulatively we realized aggregate net gains 

 

and received cash of approximately 10 billion on these hedging contracts that increased the cash we received in connection with the coffee business transactions from 42 billion in cash consideration received to 52 billion in connection with these currency contracts and the transfer of the sale proceeds to our subsidiaries that deconsolidated net assets and shares we recognized a net gain of 628 million in 2014 and a net gain of 436 million in 2015 within interest and other expense net for additional information on the jde coffee transactions see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions  

on december 18 2015 ahbv and we agreed to provide jde additional capital to pay down some of its debt with lenders our pro rata share of the capital increase was € 499 million 544 million us dollars as of december 18 2015 and was made in return for additional shares in jde such that we retained our 435 interest in jde following the capital increase to fund our share of the capital increase we contributed € 460 million 501 million of jde receivables and made a € 39 million 43 million cash payment

on december 6 2015 we agreed to make an investment in keurig green mountain inc “keurig” which is contingent upon the successful completion of a planned acquisition of keurig by jab holding co “jab” and parent company of ahbv following the close of jab’s planned acquisition of keurig in early 2016 we intend to exchange a portion of our equity interest in jde for an equity interest in keurig following the exchange of shares we expect our ownership in jde to decrease to approximately 265 and our interest in keurig to be somewhat lower we expect to account for both investments under the equity method resulting in our recognizing our share of their earnings within our earnings and our share of their dividends within our cash flows our governance rights in jde will not change significantly and we will have similar governance rights in keurig following the transaction our investment in keurig will follow the acquisition of keurig by jab which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2016 or early in the second quarter as our exchange of shares in jde for the investment in keurig is conditioned upon the actions of jab and keurig’s existing shareholders and is subject to further regulatory antitrust reviews we have not reflected the portion of our investment in jde that would be exchanged for the keurig investment as assets held for sale as of december 31 2015 

venezuela deconsolidation 

effective as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year we concluded that we no longer met the accounting criteria for consolidation of our venezuela subsidiaries due to a loss of control over our venezuelan operations and an otherthantemporary lack of currency exchangeability as of the close of the 2015 fiscal year we deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for our venezuelan operations we recorded a 778 million pretax loss as we reduced the value of our cost method investment in venezuela and all venezuelan receivables held by our other subsidiaries to realizable fair value resulting in full impairment the recorded loss also included historical cumulative translation adjustments related to our venezuelan operations that had previously been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses within equity 

beginning in 2016 we will no longer include net revenues earnings or net assets from our venezuelan subsidiaries within our consolidated financial statements under the cost method of accounting we will recognize earnings only to the extent cash is received from our venezuelan subsidiaries given the current and ongoing difficult economic regulatory and business environment in venezuela there continues to be significant uncertainty related to our operations in venezuela and we expect these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future we will monitor the extent of our ability to control our venezuelan operations and the liquidity and availability of us dollars at different rates as our current situation in venezuela may change over time and lead to consolidation at a future date see below discussion and analysis of historical results – items affecting comparability of financial results  and note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting venezuela  for more information on our historical venezuela operating results including the remeasurement losses and loss on deconsolidation 

 

summary of results 

 

  

  

  

 financial outlook 

we seek to achieve toptier financial performance we manage our business to achieve this goal using three key operating metrics organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps refer to nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section for more information on these measures additional metrics that we use or monitor include product quality measures category growth market share performance margins pricing net of commodity costs net commodity inflation volume growth power brand organic net revenue growth gross and net productivity savings brand support and related investments capital spending cash conversion cycle free cash flow return on invested capital and shareholder returns we also monitor a number of factors and trends that we expect may impact our revenues and profitability objectives 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets over the longterm we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors including increased snacking occasions greater use of convenience food and migration to more frequent smaller meals in the near term low gdp growth high unemployment and weak consumer confidence in europe and emerging markets have slowed category and our growth 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products growth in the global categories increased from approximately 36 in 2014 to 55 in 2015 and our organic net revenue growth also increased from 25 in 2014 to 37 in 2015 our organic net revenue included a 90 basis point headwind from strategic decisions to improve revenue mix in 2015 we began to improve our revenue mix by discontinuing certain low margin customerspecific product lines discontinuing certain lowmargin licensed products and continuing to simplify our portfolio we anticipate taking similar actions to optimize our portfolio in 2016 the improvement in global category growth was largely driven by price relating to higher commodity costs and currencyrelated inflationary impacts over the longterm we expect category growth to return to levels more in line with historical growth rates when the macroeconomic environment in emerging markets recovers to a better balance between price and volumemix we continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets in doing so we anticipate stimulating demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations particularly in emerging markets some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions as we experienced this past year in markets including argentina brazil russia ukraine and 

 

venezuela volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business there will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell as such we are focused on continuing to manage our costs and adjusting prices as needed to recover changing costs while we continue to invest in our global power brands and routes to market 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on product quality bringing new products and innovations to market and effectively meeting consumer needs and preferences we pursue growth opportunities such as expanding our global operations and growing our portfolio of power brands and innovative products we continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising marketing and consumer promotions 

pricing – we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions in 2015 we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs currency and other market factors in 2016 we anticipate that we will adjust our prices in response to changing market conditions price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term as the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning we also continue to work on programs to expand our profitability and margins such as our 20142018 restructuring program which is designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs 

currency – as a global company with nearly 80 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements in the last three years the us dollar strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate and several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency these currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations our 2015 net revenues were 296 billion down 135 from 2014 including a negative 126 percentage point impact from currency translation our 2014 net revenues were 342 billion down 30 from 2013 including a negative 52 percentage point impact from currency translation in 2013 net revenues were 353 billion up 08 including a negative 24 percentage point impact from currency translation while we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency denominated debt to offset the translation of certain of our overseas operations we generally do not hedge against currency translation we primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on crosscurrency transactions due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our crosscurrency transaction risks we have historically also been exposed to currency devaluation risks impacting earnings particularly in connection with our venezuela operations which as of december 31 2015 has been deconsolidated see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting venezuela for more information  the economy monetary policies and other business restrictions in venezuela as well as in other developing countries have created a challenging business environment in which to operate and our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses may be limited while we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks factors such as continued global market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty and other external developments could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future 

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lower cost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases in 2015 2014 and 2013 we repaid 156 billion of our longterm debt and issued lowercost longterm euro british pound sterling swiss franc and us dollardenominated debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2015 was 37 down from 43 as of december 31 2014 and down from 48 as of december 31 2013 refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for additional debt activity in 2016 

 

discussion and analysis of historical results 

items affecting comparability of financial results 

the following table includes significant income or expense items that affected the comparability of our pretax results of operations and our effective tax rates please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements indicated below for more information refer also to the consolidated results of operations – net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international table for the per share impacts of these items 

 



 

   

consolidated results of operations 

the following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2015 with 2014 and 2014 with 2013 

2015 compared with 2014 

 

 



net revenues – net revenues decreased 4608 million 135 to 29636 million in 2015 and organic net revenue 1 increased 1131 million 37 to 31599 million organic net revenue growth from power brands was 54 and from emerging markets was 106 the underlying changes in net revenues and organic net revenue are detailed below 

 



 

  organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing partially offset by unfavorable volumemix net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input costdriven pricing actions taken during the year higher net pricing was reflected across all segments unfavorable volumemix was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain lowmargin product lines unfavorable volumemix was reflected in all segments except north america unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by 3833 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to several currencies including the euro brazilian real russian ruble venezuelan bolivar australian dollar and british pound sterling the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 2149 million for the year the july 15 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in vietnam added 128 million in incremental net revenues constant currency basis for the year the north america segment accounting calendar change resulted in a yearoveryear increase in net revenues of 78 million for the year the february 16 2015 acquisition of the enjoy life foods snack food business in north america added 37 million in incremental net revenues for the year 

 

operating income – operating income increased 5655 million 1744 to 8897 million in 2015 adjusted operating income 1 increased 172 million 47 to 3830 million and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis 1 increased 694 million 190 to 4352 million due to the following 

 



 

           during 2015 higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs higher net pricing due to inputcost driven pricing actions taken during the year was reflected across all segments the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials partially offset by lower manufacturing costs unfavorable volumemix was reflected across all segments 

total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 880 million from 2014 due to a number of factors noted in the table above including in part a favorable currency impact the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business lower devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in venezuela and the absence of 20122014 restructuring program costs the decreases were partially offset by increases from higher costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program costs associated with the coffee business transactions lower valueadded tax “vat”related settlements the reclassification of equity method investment earnings the impact of acquisitions and a gain on a sale of property in 2014 

excluding the factors noted above selling general and administrative expenses increased 327 million from 2014 the increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotions support particularly behind our power brands 

excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business the change in unrealized gains  losses increased operating income by 129 million in 2015 in 2015 the net unrealized gains on currency and commodity hedging activity were 56 million 96 million including coffee related activity as compared to net unrealized losses of 73 million 112 million including coffee related activity in 2014 related to currency and commodity hedging activity we recorded a benefit of 30 million in 2015 from vatrelated settlements in latin america as compared to 84 million in 2014 

unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by 522 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most currencies including the euro brazilian real venezuelan bolivar british pound sterling australian dollar and russian ruble 

operating income margin increased from 95 in 2014 to 300 in 2015 the increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the pretax gain on the coffee business transactions an increase in our adjusted operating income margin the absence of 20122014 restructuring program costs and lower devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in venezuela the items that increased operating income margin were partially offset by the loss on deconsolidation of venezuela higher costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program and costs associated with the coffee business transactions adjusted operating income margin increased from 120 in 2014 to 137 in 2015 the increase in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by improved gross margin reflecting productivity efforts and the yearoveryear favorable impact of unrealized gains  losses on currency and commodity hedging activities and improved overhead leverage from cost reduction programs partially offset by increased advertising and consumer promotions support

   organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing partially offset by unfavorable volumemix overall net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input costdriven pricing actions implemented over the course of the year higher net pricing was reflected primarily in latin america eemea europe and asia pacific unfavorable volumemix was driven primarily by europe asia pacific and latin america in addition to price elasticity the decline was largely due to a slow response by competitors to higher input costs as well as the impact of pricerelated customer disruptions in europe unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by 1626 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the us dollar relative to several currencies including the argentinean peso brazilian real russian ruble australian dollar and ukrainian hryvnya partially offset by the strength of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar our historical coffee business recorded a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 128 million for the year the impact of divestitures completed in 2013 including a salty snacks business in turkey a confectionery business in south africa and a chocolate business in spain resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 70 million the accounting calendar change made in europe in 2013 resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 30 million the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco on february 22 2013 added 14 million in incremental net revenues in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition

        during 2014 higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs higher net pricing was reflected across all segments the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials partially offset by lower manufacturing costs unfavorable volumemix was driven by latin america asia pacific europe and eemea partially offset by gains in north america 

total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 222 million from 2013 due to a number of factors noted in the table above including in part a favorable currency impact lower integration program costs vatrelated settlements in 2014 lower costs associated with our historical coffee business lower spinoff costs 2013 business divestitures and a gain on a sale of property in 2014 these decreases were more than offset by increases from a 2013 benefit received related to the resolution of a cadbury acquisition indemnification increased devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in venezuela costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program costs related to the coffee business transactions gains on property sales in 2013 and higher 20122014 restructuring program costs 

excluding the factors noted above selling general and administrative expenses decreased 306 million from 2013 driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs overhead costs fell as a result of continued cost reduction efforts advertising and consumer promotion costs were lower due primarily to savings from consolidating media providers reductions in nonworking media costs and efficiencies gained by shifting spending to lowercost digital media outlets while we increased our spending on our power brands and maintained working media spending 

excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business the change in unrealized gains  losses decreased operating income by 116 million in 2014 in 2014 the net unrealized losses on primarily commodity hedging activity were 73 million 112 million including coffeerelated activity as compared to net unrealized gains of 43 million in 2013 62 million including coffeerelated activity related to currency and commodity hedging activity in 2013 we recorded pretax gains of 68 million related to sales of properties in india and europe in 2014 we recorded a benefit of 84 million related to vatrelated settlements in latin america in 2014 we recorded a pretax gain of 7 million related to the sale of a property in europe the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco on february 22 2013 added 3 million in incremental operating income in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary of the acquisition 

unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by 248 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and 2014 and the strength of the us dollar relative to several currencies including the argentinean peso brazilian real australian dollar russian ruble and canadian dollar partially offset by the strength of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar 

operating income margin decreased from 112 in 2013 to 95 in 2014 the decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program the yearoveryear negative impact of the benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification recorded in 2013 higher costs for the 20122014 restructuring program the impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela and costs incurred associated with the coffee business transactions partially offset by an increase in our adjusted operating income margin and lower integration program costs adjusted operating income margin increased from 110 in 2013 to 120 in 2014 the increase in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by lower overhead costs from continued cost reduction efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due primarily to productivity initiatives partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin due entirely to the unfavorable impact of unrealized gains  losses on currency and commodity hedging activities 

 

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international – net earnings attributable to mondelēz international of 2184 million in 2014 decreased by 1731 million 442 due primarily to the results of the discontinued operations in the prior year diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to mondelēz international was 128 in 2014 down 001 08 from 129 in 2013 adjusted eps 1 was 175 in 2014 up 021 136 from 154 in 2013 adjusted eps on a constant currency basis 1 was 189 in 2014 up 035 227 from 154 in 2013 

 



 

           results of operations by reportable segment

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets 

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting our goodwill reporting units we review our operating segment and reporting unit structure for goodwill testing annually or as significant changes in the organization occur annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead quantitative impairment testing consists of a twostep evaluation the first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for our europe and north america reporting units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 68 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america asia pacific and eemea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 98 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we would apply a second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill 

on july 2 2015 we deconsolidated our global coffee businesses from our europe eemea and asia pacific segments goodwill was deconsolidated from the impacted reporting units based on relative fair values of the coffee and remaining businesses intangible assets contributed with the coffee business transactions were specifically identified we deconsolidated total goodwill of 1664 million and intangible assets of less than 1 million during the third quarter of 2015 refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions – coffee business transactions  for more information 

in 2015 2014 and 2013 there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2015 annual impairment testing each of our reporting units had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value in connection with the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations on december 31 2015 we tested our latin america reporting unit and determined the remaining businesses excluding venezuela had sufficient fair value in excess of carrying value such that there were no impairments of goodwill while all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

annually we assess nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value estimated fair value is determined using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

during our 2015 annual testing of nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded 71 million of impairment charges related to four trademarks the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth partly driven by decisions made in the fourth quarter to redirect support for the products to other regional and global brands and slowdowns in local economies we recorded charges related to candy and biscuit trademarks of 44 million in asia pacific 22 million in europe and 5 million in latin america the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method which utilizes estimates of future sales growth rates royalty 

 

rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value during our 2015 intangible asset impairment review we noted seven brands including the four impaired trademarks with 598 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2015 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less while these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future in 2014 we recorded a 48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our asia pacific segment and a 9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our europe segment additionally in connection with the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operations on december 31 2015 we recorded 12 million of impairment charges within the loss on deconsolidation of venezuela related to a biscuit trademark 

refer also to note 5 goodwill and intangible assets  for additional information 

trade and marketing programs 

we promote our products with advertising marketing sales incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to cooperative advertising instore displays consumer promotions new product introduction fees discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and estimated program spending we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits for accounting purposes we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates expected returns on plan assets expected compensation increases employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality and health care cost trends we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 

in 2016 we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to decrease by approximately 135 million to 185 million due to a combination of factors including a decreased number of plan participants changes in discount rates company contributions to the plans and a change in our approach to measuring service and interest costs for 2015 we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations for 2016 we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows we believe the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve this change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations nor the funded status of our plans 

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses since many of our pension plans are partially funded the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2016 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease on our annual benefit plan costs 

 



income taxes 

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have properly accounted for uncertain tax positions 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events such as material changes in longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production prior to the july 2 2015 coffee business transactions increased costs for coffee beans were the highest driver of increased commodity costs for the first half of 2015 during 2015 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs excluding coffee were increased costs for packaging nuts cocoa energy grains and oils and higher currencyrelated costs on our commodity purchases partially offset by lower costs for dairy and sugar 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2016 while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our 45 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program international credit lines and longterm debt issuances for regular funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the united states 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 3728 million in 2015 3562 million in 2014 and 6410 million in 2013 cash flows from operating activities in all years were impacted by our working capital improvements primarily due to continually decreasing our cash conversion cycle a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding to negative 12 days in 2015 positive 10 days in 2014 and positive 20 days in 2013 cash flows from operating activities were favorable in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily due to higher relative working capital cash improvements than in 2014 and significant tax payments in 2014 related to the 26 billion starbucks arbitration award we received in late 2013 partially offset by higher contributions related to our pensions benefit plans cash flows from operating activities were unfavorable in 2014 relative to 2013 primarily related to our receipt of 26 billion of net cash from the resolution of the starbucks arbitration in 2013 and higher related income taxes paid in 2014 and lower relative working capital cash improvements than in 2013 partially offset by lower interest payments in 2014 following the debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 

net cash provided by  used in investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 2649 million in 2015 and net cash used in investing activities was 1642 million in 2014 and 1483 million in 2013 the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily relates to 47 billion of proceeds net of divested cash and transaction costs from the contribution of our global coffee businesses and the divestiture of agf the cash receipt of 10 billion due to the settlement of currency exchange forward contracts related to our coffee business transactions and lower capital expenditures in 2015 of 128 million partially offset by the 611 million reduction of cash due to the venezuela deconsolidation 501 million of contributed jde receivables and a 43 million cash payment to fund a capital increase in jde and 527 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in vietnam and the enjoy life foods snack food business in 2015 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 relates to lower cash inflows to offset higher capital expenditures in 2014 in 2013 we received higher cash proceeds from property sales net proceeds of 60 million from divestitures and 55 million in cash from kraft foods group in connection with the spinoff partially offset by 119 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in morocco in 2013 

 

capital expenditures were 1514 million in 2015 1642 million in 2014 and 1622 million in 2013 the 2015 capital expenditures were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2016 capital expenditures to be up to 15 billion including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and the 20142018 restructuring program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 5883 million in 2015 2688 million in 2014 and 6687 million in 2013 the increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to higher repayments of longterm debt in 2015 including the tender offers and euro notes maturities 19 billion of higher share repurchases and higher net shortterm debt repayments partially offset by higher proceeds received from longterm note issuances the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily due to significantly lower longterm debt repayments and lower share repurchases in 2014 offset in part by decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and other shortterm borrowings and higher dividend payments in 2014 

debt 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for details of our tender offers and debt issuances during 2015 2014 and 2013 the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors generally in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital needs 

in july 2015 our board of directors approved a 5 billion longterm financing authority to replace the prior authority as of december 31 2015 we had 4 billion of longterm financing authority remaining 

during 2016 1750 million of longterm debt matured in february we funded this repayment with net proceeds from debt issuances in january 2016 cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper there are no other scheduled maturities of longterm debt within the 12 months following december 31 2015 

our total debt was 154 billion at december 31 2015 and 167 billion at december 31 2014 our debttocapitalization ratio was 035 at december 31 2015 and 038 at december 31 2014 at december 31 2015 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 86 years our average daily commercial borrowings were 22 billion in 2015 19 billion in 2014 and 10 billion in 2013 we expect to continue to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for more information on our debt and debt covenants

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2015 

 



 

    

  nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional transparency on how we evaluate our business we use certain nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we disclose nongaap financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance 

our primary nongaap financial measures reflect how we evaluate our current and prioryear operating results as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change over time 

 

    

  

  

  

   we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures may vary among other companies the nongaap financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k 

 

organic net revenue 

applying the definition of “organic net revenue” the adjustments made to “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impact of currency the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business divestitures acquisitions and accounting calendar changes we believe that organic net revenue better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results we also evaluate our organic net revenue growth from emerging markets and power brands and these underlying measures are also reconciled to us gaap below 

 

  

   

adjusted operating income 

applying the definition of “adjusted operating income” the adjustments made to “operating income” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude spinoff costs 20122014 restructuring program costs 20142018 restructuring program costs the integration program and other acquisition integration costs the benefit from the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification resolution loss on deconsolidation of venezuela the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela impairment charges related to intangible assets incremental costs associated with the coffee business transactions operating income from our historical coffee business gain on the coffee business transactions operating results of divestitures gains on acquisitions and divestitures acquisitionrelated costs and an adjustment for equity method investment earnings historically reported within operating income that were reclassified to aftertax earnings we also evaluate adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis we believe these measures provide improved comparability of operating results 

 



 



 

     

adjusted eps 

applying the definition of “adjusted eps” the adjustments made to “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude spinoff costs 20122014 restructuring program costs 20142018 restructuring program costs the integration program and other acquisition integration costs the net benefit from the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification resolution the residual tax benefit impact from the resolution of the starbucks arbitration losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses loss on deconsolidation of venezuela the remeasurement of net monetary assets in venezuela impairment charges related to intangible assets hedging gains and incremental costs associated with the coffee business transactions gain on the coffee business transactions losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans net earnings from divestitures aftertax gainloss on divestitures our proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our jde equity method investee and acquisitionrelated costs we also evaluate adjusted eps on a constant currency basis we believe adjusted eps provides improved comparability of operating results 

 



 

  



 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 9 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by reportable segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results during 2015 for additional information on the impact of currency policies the deconsolidation of our venezuelan operation and the historical remeasurement of our venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—currency translation and highly inflationary accounting 

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions to manage the input cost volatility we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads london interbank offered rates “libor” euro interbank offered rate “euribor” and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions in addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments during 2015 we retired 42 billion of our longterm debt and issued 45 billion of lower borrowing cost debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2015 was 37 down from 43 as of december 31 2014 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during 2015 the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2015 and 2014 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2015 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our ceo and cfo or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that 

 

     

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

based on this assessment management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2015 based on the criteria in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the coso

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

management together with our ceo and cfo evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2015 as outlined above we remediated the previously reported material weakness related to our accounting for income taxes by adding controls in prior periods we concluded our testing of those controls in the fourth quarter supporting our remediation determination 

during the year ended december 31 2015 we worked with outsourced partners to further simplify and standardize processes and focus on scalable transactional processes across all regions specifically during the fourth quarter of 2015 we began to transition some of our transactional processing and financial reporting for a number of countries in our asia pacific eemea and latin america regions as well as some of our asia pacific region ordertocash transactional processing to two outsourced partners we also transitioned some of our procurement administration functions for our north america and latin america regions to one of our outsourced partners we also transitioned certain financial system reconciliations for our eemea and asia pacific regions to another outsourced partner per our service agreements the controls previously established around these accounting functions will be maintained by our outsourced partners and they are subject to management’s internal control testing 

there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

beginning in 2015 we changed our regional operating structure to create greater category management leadership and structure within each of our regions as we have in place within our europe and north america regions we expect these changes to lead to further global and local consumerpreferred innovations and accelerate our speed to market 

 

  

  

  

reportable segments 

our operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments 

     we manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale manage different and changing business environments more effectively at a local level and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets our regional management teams have responsibility for the business product categories and financial results in the regions 

our segment net revenues for each of the last three years were 

 



our brands span five product categories 

 

     during 2014 our segments contributed to our net revenues in these product categories as follows 

 



within our product categories the classes of products that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net revenues were 

 



 

we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze our segment performance and trends for a definition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pretax earnings as well as other information on our segments see note 17 segment reporting  

our segment operating income for each of the last three years was 

 



currency and other items significantly affect the comparability of our consolidated and segment operating results from year to year please see our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a review of our operating results 

during the last three fiscal years our segments contributed to segment operating income as reflected below 

 



significant divestitures and acquisitions 

for information on our significant past and planned divestitures and acquisitions please refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions and specifically our discussion under planned coffee business transactions and spinoff of kraft foods group  

customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2014 our five largest customers accounted for 157 and our ten largest customers accounted for 237 of net revenues from continuing operations in 2014 

seasonality 

demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal events 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large multinational as well as numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives than we do and therefore approach pricing and promotional decisions differently we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures we believe these investments lead to a better value proposition for the consumer 

 

distribution and marketing 

across our segments we generally sell our products to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we also use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

we conduct marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing and advertising including onair print outdoor digital and social media and other product promotions ii consumer sales incentives such as coupons and rebates and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa coffee dairy wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we regularly monitor worldwide supply cost and currency trends related to these commodities so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and energy sources required for production 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources for additional information on our commodity costs refer to the commodity trends section within management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

throughout the countries in which we do business government authorities are continually adopting new laws and implementing new regulations that affect our business and operations examples include selective food taxes in mexico profit price and other controls imposed within venezuela and argentina russian sanctions on the sourcing of raw materials from the european union and potential labeling disclosure requirements for genetically modified ingredients in the united states we will continue to monitor developments of the new laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with these new laws and regulations will be material also refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  for additional information on government regulations and currency effects on our operations in venezuela argentina and russia

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors include major international food snack and beverage companies that like us operate in multiple geographic areas as well as numerous local and regional companies we compete based on product quality brand recognition and loyalty service product innovation taste convenience the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and price if we do not effectively respond to challenges from our competitors our business could be adversely affected 

competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases failure to effectively assess change and set proper pricing may negatively impact the achievement of our strategic and financial goals the emergence of new distribution channels such as internet sales directly to consumers may affect customer and consumer preferences cost structures or margins we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share these expenditures might not result in trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

in addition companies in our industry are under increasing pressure to improve the efficiency of their overall cost structures we have announced a transformation agenda with the goals of focusing our portfolio improving our cost structure and operating model and accelerating our growth if we do not achieve these objectives in a way that minimizes disruptions to our business our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms including online and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing attention from the media shareholders consumers activists and other stakeholders on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and increased focus on food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us product quality and safety or environmental and human rights risks in our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain extend and expand our brand image particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites whether factual or not or security breaches related to use of our social media and failure to respond effectively to these posts comments or activities could seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate in addition we might fail to invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image as a result we might be required to recognize impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill if we do not successfully maintain extend and expand our reputation and brand image then our brands product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to risks from operating globally 

we are a global company and generated 821 of our 2014 net revenues 831 of our 2013 net revenues and 829 of our 2012 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in approximately 165 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 

            in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand the slowdown in economic growth or high unemployment in some emerging markets could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states could adversely affect us all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including brazil china india mexico russia venezuela argentina ukraine the middle east africa and southeast asia however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and regulatory risks our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to provide our products to our customers consistently factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters fire explosions terrorism political unrest generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers’ confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition we might not have the functions processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth further changes to regulatory restrictions within the markets in which we operate may impact our ability to supply multiple markets with a streamlined manufacturing footprint these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2014 we sold our products in approximately 165 countries and had operations in more than 80 countries a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and dividends in addition movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we seek to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations primarily on crosscurrency transactions but our efforts may not be successful accordingly changes in the currency exchange rates that we use to translate our results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes or for transactions involving multiple currencies could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including cocoa coffee dairy wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners and nuts in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses prices for these raw materials other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict these conditions include global competition for resources currency fluctuations political conditions severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity crop disease or pests water risk health pandemics consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers who might lack the capacity to invest to increase 

 

productivity or adapt to changing conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices and hedge against input price increases we cannot fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase or decrease the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products to cover increased input costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases in input costs could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues if our mitigation activities are not effective if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices or if we are limited by supply constraints our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production storage distribution sales advertising and marketing as well as licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce 

we must hire retain and develop effective leaders and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel in the many countries in which we manufacture and market our products and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness 

we also face increased personnelrelated risks in connection with implementing the changes in our transformation agenda related to our operating model and business processes these risks could lead to operational challenges including increased competition for employees with the skills we require to achieve our business goals higher employee turnover including of employees with key capabilities and challenges in developing the capabilities necessary to transform our business processes furthermore we might be unable to manage changes in or that affect our workforce appropriately or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees this includes our management of employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils who represent approximately 64 of our 91000 employees outside the united states and approximately 28 of our 13000 us employees 

these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must address risks related to consolidation of retail customers and leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer and other economy brands 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and our other major markets continue to consolidate resulting in fewer but larger customers with whom we can conduct business larger more sophisticated retail customers and alliances among customers can resist price increases delist or reduce the shelf space allotted to our products and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs longer payment terms or specifically tailored products in addition larger retail customers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher quality or value to our consumers than the less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if consumers perceive the difference in the quality or value between our products and retailer or other economy brands has narrowed if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

 

if we do not effectively respond to retail consolidation increasing retail power and competition from retailer and other economy brands our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to and may fail to manage changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers 

during 2014 our five largest customers accounted for 157 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of or disruptions related to significant customers such as the disruptions we experienced in 2014 with customers in france could result in a material reduction in sales or change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer this could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

additionally disputes with significant suppliers including those related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

we could decide or laws or regulations could require us to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering in addition if another company recalls or experiences negative publicity related to a product in a category in which we compete consumers might reduce their overall consumption of products in this category any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action or a widespread product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we could be subject to legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions 

we are a large food and snacking company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate policies and procedures we have implemented to promote compliance with existing laws and regulations moreover our failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws regulations or controls could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions 

we evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures minority investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of a transaction minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners 

 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and strategic alliances pose additional risks as we share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more other parties who may not have the same objectives priorities strategies or resources as we do in may 2014 we entered into an agreement to combine our wholly owned coffee portfolio outside of france with de master blenders 1753 bv and in conjunction with that transaction acorn holdings bv owner of de master blenders 1753 bv made a binding offer to receive our coffee business in france we might not effectively separate our coffee business integrate our operations into the new venture or complete the transaction on the anticipated timeframe furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities or related activities such as reorganizations restructuring programs and transformation initiatives may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after a divestiture is completed gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks and challenges could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging and other preferences of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to these preferences moreover weak economic conditions recession equity market volatility or other factors could affect consumer preferences and demand if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base including by geography we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example recently consumers have increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sodium and added sugar consumption in addition consumer preferences differ by region and we must monitor and adjust our use of ingredients to respond to these regional preferences we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect us and we have not maintained effective internal controls over our accounting for income taxes 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include among others the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements we could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis as a result our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

 

in connection with management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013 we determined that we did not maintain effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness accuracy and presentation of our accounting for income taxes including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities we determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constituted a material weakness as of december 31 2014 we made substantial progress toward remediating the material weakness see item 9a controls and procedures  for a discussion of the material weakness and the progress on the remediation if the new controls we have implemented to address the material weakness and to strengthen our overall internal control over accounting for income taxes are not designed or do not operate effectively if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following these new processes or if we are otherwise unable to remediate this material weakness we may not timely or accurately report our financial condition or results of operations this could adversely affect our stock price and the confidence of investors business partners and others in our financial reports 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel customers and suppliers around the world these information technology systems many of which are managed by third parties or used in connection with shared service centers may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors natural disasters terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events furthermore to the extent our information technology systems are managed by third parties or used in connection with external shared service centers we would have to coordinate with these third parties to try to resolve issues related to these events if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results 

in addition if we are unable to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks and other information security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers suppliers or employees the mishandling or inappropriate disclosure of nonpublic sensitive or protected information could lead to the loss of intellectual property negatively impact planned corporate transactions or damage our reputation and brand image misuse leakage or falsification of legally protected information could also result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and have a negative impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

we may need to access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our shortand longterm debt credit ratings interest rates the stability of financial institutions with which we partner the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry will affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the commercial paper markets in the united states and europe for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

limitations on our ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in our liquidity or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world at the end of 2014 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 125 billion and plan assets were 96 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate the viability of other employers in the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation 

volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we are required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost a portion of our pension trust assets is invested in european sovereign debt and subject to heightened risk that it could lose value as a result of political and financial turmoil in europe 

due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans we may have exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees our contributions to a multiemployer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multiemployer plan we may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to a withdrawing employer and our costs might increase as a result further if we have a partial or complete withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay an amount to the plan based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan this liability will generally increase if other employers cease participating in the plan whether or not due to bankruptcy see note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our multiemployer pension plans 

a significant increase in our pension benefit obligations or funding requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and our failure to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of third party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations

 fi nancial outlook 

we seek to achieve toptier financial performance we manage our business to achieve this goal using a number of operating metrics including organic net revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted eps refer to nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section for more information on these measures additional metrics that we use or monitor include product quality measures category growth market share performance pricing net of commodity costs net commodity inflation volume growth power brand organic net revenue growth gross and net productivity savings brand support and related investments capital spending cash conversion cycle free cash flow return on invested capital and shareholder returns we also monitor a number of factors and trends that we expect may impact our near and longterm revenues and profitability objectives 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class particularly in emerging markets over the longterm we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors including increased snacking occasions greater use of convenience food and migration to more frequent smaller meals in the near term lower gdp growth high unemployment and weak consumer confidence in europe and emerging markets has slowed category and our growth 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products growth in the global categories slowed from approximately 4 in 2013 to 36 in 2014 we believe the slowdown in category growth will continue to affect our nearterm net revenue growth but we expect the slowdown particularly in emerging markets to be temporary we expect category growth to return to levels more in line with the expected growth of emerging markets and consumer spending in those markets we continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets in doing so we anticipate stimulating demand in our categories and growing our position in these markets 

 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations particularly in emerging markets some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions as we experienced this past year in markets including russia ukraine venezuela and argentina volatility in these markets affects demand for and the costs of our products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business there will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell as such we are focused on aggressively managing our costs currently as we continue to invest in brand building and routes to market 

competition – we operate in highly competitive markets that include global regional and local competitors our advantaged geographic footprint operating scale and portfolio of brands have all significantly contributed to building our marketleading positions across most of the product categories in which we sell to grow and maintain our market positions we focus on product quality bringing new products and innovations to market and effectively meeting consumer needs and preferences we pursue significant growth opportunities such as expanding our global operations and growing our portfolio of power brands and innovative products we continue to optimize our manufacturing and other operations and invest in our brands through ongoing research and development advertising and marketing consumer promotions 

pricing – we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our product input costs our net revenue growth and profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions in 2014 we generally increased prices in response to higher commodity costs currency and other market factors in 2015 we continue to expect higher aggregate commodity and related costs and anticipate adjusting our prices in response to changing market conditions price competition or delayed price increases by competitors or customers also affected our net revenues in 2014 and may continue to affect net revenues or market share in the near term until the market adjusts to the changes in input costs and other market conditions in 2015 we plan to address some of these issues and improve our revenue mix by discontinuing certain low margin customerspecific product lines discontinuing certain lowmargin licensed products and continuing to simplify our portfolio of skus 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning we continue to work on various programs to expand our profitability and margins such as our 20142018 restructuring program designed to bring about significant reductions in our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs 

currency – as a global company with over 80 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements in 2014 as the us dollar strengthened relative to other currencies in which we operate and as several countries experienced significant declines in or devaluations of their currency these currency movements had a significant negative effect on our reported results of operations our 2014 net revenues were 342 billion down 30 from 2013 including a negative 51 percentage point impact from currency translation while we have net investment hedges in the form of local currency denominated debt to offset the translation of certain of our overseas investments we generally do not hedge against currency translation we primarily seek to hedge against economic losses on crosscurrency transactions due to limited markets for hedging currency transactions and other factors we may not be able to effectively hedge all of our crosscurrency transaction risks during 2014 we recognized 167 million of currency devaluation charges in pretax earnings related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets in venezuela the economy monetary policies and other business restrictions in venezuela as well as in other countries such as argentina and russia have created a challenging business environment in which to operate and our ability to hedge against currencyrelated economic losses may be limited while we work to mitigate our exposure to these currency risks factors such as continued global market volatility actions by foreign governments political uncertainty and other external developments could lead to further unfavorable currency impacts in the future 

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt we continue to use lower cost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital expenditures and other investments dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of 2014 and fourth quarter of 2013 we retired 5 billion of our longterm us dollardenominated debt and issued lowercost longterm euro and us dollardenominated debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2014 was 43 down from 48 as of december 31 2013 and down from 58 as of december 31 2012

items affecting comparability of financial results 

the following table includes significant income or expense items that affected the comparability of our pretax results of operations and our effective tax rates please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements indicated below for more information refer also to the consolidated results of operations – net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international table for the per share impacts of these items 

 



 

consolidated results of operations 

the following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2014 with 2013 and 2013 with 2012 

2014 compared with 2013 

 



net revenues – net revenues decreased 1055 million 30 to 34244 million in 2014 and organic net revenue 1 increased 845 million 24 to 36036 million the change in net revenues and organic net revenue are detailed below 

 



 

 organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing partially offset by unfavorable volumemix overall net pricing was up as we realized the effects of input costdriven pricing actions implemented over the course of the year higher net pricing was reflected primarily in latin america eemea europe and asia pacific unfavorable volumemix was driven primarily by europe asia pacific and latin america in addition to price elasticity the decline was largely due to a slow response by competitors to higher input costs as well as the impact of pricerelated customer disruptions in europe unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by 1806 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the us dollar relative to several currencies including the argentinean peso russian ruble brazilian real and ukrainian hryvnya partially offset by the strength of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar the impact of divestitures completed in 2013 resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 70 million and included a salty snacks business in turkey a confectionery business in south africa and a chocolate business in spain the accounting calendar change made in europe in 2013 resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 38 million the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco on february 22 2013 added 14 million in incremental net revenues this year for the period prior to the anniversary date of the acquisition 

 

operating income – operating income decreased 729 million 184 to 3242 million in 2014 adjusted operating income 1 increased 149 million 35 to 4416 million and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis 1 increased 436 million 102 to 4703 million due to the following 

 



 

 during 2014 higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs higher net pricing was reflected across all segments the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials partially offset by lower manufacturing costs unfavorable volumemix was driven by latin america asia pacific and europe partially offset by gains in eemea and north america 

 

total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 222 million from 2013 due to a number of factors noted in the table above including in part a favorable currency impact lower integration program costs valueadded tax “vat”related settlements in 2014 lower spinoff costs 2013 business divestitures and a gain on a sale of property in 2014 items that increased selling general and administrative expenses included a 2013 benefit received related to the resolution of a cadbury acquisition indemnification increased devaluation charges related to our net monetary assets in venezuela costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program costs incurred in 2014 related to the jde coffee transactions gains on property sales in 2013 and higher 20122014 restructuring program costs 

excluding the factors noted above selling general and administrative expenses decreased 313 million from 2013 driven primarily by lower overhead costs and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs overhead costs fell as a result of continued cost reduction efforts advertising and consumer promotion costs were lower due primarily to savings from consolidating media providers reductions in nonworking media costs and efficiencies gained by shifting spending to lowercost digital media outlets while we increased our spending on our power brands and maintained working media spending 

the change in unrealized gains  losses decreased operating income by 174 million in 2014 in 2014 the net unrealized losses on primarily commodity hedging activity were 112 million as compared to net unrealized gains of 62 million in 2013 related to currency and commodity hedging activity in 2013 we recorded pretax gains of 68 million related to sales of properties in india and europe in 2014 we recorded a benefit of 84 million related to vatrelated settlements in latin america in 2014 we recorded a pretax gain of 7 million related to the sale of a property in europe the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco on february 22 2013 added 3 million in incremental operating income in 2014 for the period prior to the anniversary of the acquisition 

unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by 287 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in 2013 and 2014 and the strength of the us dollar relative to several currencies including the argentinean peso brazilian real russian ruble and ukrainian hryvnya partially offset by the strength of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar 

operating income margin decreased from 112 in 2013 to 95 in 2014 the decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by costs incurred for the 20142018 restructuring program the yearoveryear negative impact of the benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification recorded in 2013 higher costs for the 20122014 restructuring program the impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela and costs incurred related to the jde coffee transactions partially offset by lower integration program costs adjusted operating income margin increased from 121 in 2013 to 129 in 2014 the increase in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by lower overhead costs from continued cost reduction efforts and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs due primarily to current year productivity initiatives partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin due entirely to the unfavorable impact of unrealized gains  losses on currency and commodity hedging activities 

 

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international – net earnings attributable to mondelēz international of 2184 million in 2014 decreased by 1731 million 442 due primarily to the results of the discontinued operations in the prior year diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to mondelēz international was 128 in 2014 down 001 08 from 129 in 2013 adjusted eps 1 was 176 in 2014 up 022 143 from 154 in 2013 adjusted eps on a constant currency basis 1 was 190 in 2014 up 036 234 from 154 in 2013

 organic net revenue growth was driven by favorable volumemix and higher net pricing favorable volumemix was driven primarily by higher shipments across all segments except asia pacific higher net pricing in latin america primarily related to venezuela argentina and brazil and in north america was partially offset by lower net pricing in europe asia pacific and eemea primarily due to lower coffee prices unfavorable currency decreased net revenues by 837 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the us dollar relative to most currencies including the brazilian real argentinean peso australian dollar indian rupee japanese yen and south african rand partially offset by the strength of the euro relative the us dollar the impact of divestitures resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 345 million in addition the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco added 91 million in net revenues and the accounting calendar change in europe added 37 million in net revenues in 2013

  favorable volumemix was driven primarily by volume gains across all segments except asia pacific higher net pricing in latin america and north america was partially offset by lower net pricing in europe asia pacific and eemea primarily due to lower coffee pricing during 2013 increased input costs outpaced higher net pricing the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs in part due to higher currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials partially offset by lower manufacturing costs 

total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 497 million from 2012 due in part to lower spinoff costs a benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification a favorable currency impact net of the negative impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela gains on the sales of properties in 2013 and the impact of businesses divested in 2013 and 2012 which were partially offset by gains on sales of properties in 2012 higher integration program costs higher 20122014 restructuring program costs and the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired biscuit operations in morocco 

 

excluding the factors noted above selling general and administrative expenses increased 246 million from 2012 driven primarily by higher overhead costs in emerging markets including investments in sales capabilities and routetomarket expansion in emerging markets the 2012 reversal of reserves carried over from the cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer required prioryear proceeds from insurance settlements and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in asia pacific eemea and latin america 

the change in unrealized gains  losses added 61 million in operating income for 2013 in 2013 the net unrealized gains were 62 million as compared to net unrealized gains of 1 million in 2012 in 2013 we recorded pretax gains of 68 million related to sales of properties in india and europe in 2012 we recorded pretax gains of 77 million related to sales of properties in russia and turkey the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco added 16 million in operating income for 2013 accounting calendar changes that went into effect in europe in the first quarter of 2013 increased operating income by 6 million 

unfavorable currency impacts decreased operating income by 146 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the us dollar relative to most currencies including the brazilian real argentinean peso indian rupee japanese yen south african rand and russian ruble partially offset by the strength of the euro relative to the us dollar 

operating income margin increased from 104 in 2012 to 112 in 2013 the increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by lower spinoff costs and the benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification partially offset by higher costs for the 20122014 restructuring program lower integration program costs a negative impact from divestitures and the unfavorable impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela adjusted operating income margin decreased from 123 in 2012 to 121 in 2013 the decrease in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by a modest decline in gross margin due to the timing of price increases to cover rising currency exchange transaction costs on imported raw materials in the second half of the year partially offset by the benefit of leverage on our selling general and administrative expenses 

 

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international – net earnings attributable to mondelēz international of 3915 million increased by 848 million 276 in 2013 diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international was 219 in 2013 up 048 281 from 2012 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to mondelēz international was 129 in 2013 up 041 466 from 2012 adjusted eps 1 was 154 in 2013 up 011 77 from 2012 adjusted eps on a constant currency basis 1 was 160 in 2013 up 017 119 from 2012 

 



 

    

           

results of operations by reportable segment 

our operations and management structure are organized into five reportable operating segments 

 

     we manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale manage different and changing business environments more effectively at a local level and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets beginning in 2015 within each region we also manage by product category in the historical periods presented and discussed below we managed our operations within latin america asia pacific and eemea by location and within europe and north america by location and product category 

we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends see note 17 segment reporting for additional information on our segments and items affecting comparability of financial results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of our most significant assumptions and estimates 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets  

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter we assess goodwill impairment risk throughout the year by performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors affecting the reporting units with goodwill annually we may perform qualitative testing or depending on factors such as prioryear test results current year developments current risk evaluations and other practical considerations we may elect to do quantitative testing instead quantitative impairment testing consists of a twostep evaluation the first step compares a reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value this year for reporting units in our europe and north america segments we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 69 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america asia pacific and eemea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 99 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans and industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value we apply the second step to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value of the goodwill 

on january 1 2014 an organizational change occurred within our north america region from a country and product category structure to a regional product category structure as a result our north america region now has two instead of four reporting units for any reporting units that were reorganized the goodwill was allocated to the new reporting unit structure based on relative fair values of the related business units 

in 2014 2013 and 2012 all reporting units passed our annual goodwill impairment testing if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future 

we test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by performing a qualitative review and assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible assets if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific asset we quantitatively test it for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value with its carrying value estimated fair value is determined using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value the asset is impaired and its carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value 

during our 2014 review of nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded 57 million of impairment charges related to two trademarks in both cases the impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth and decisions made in the fourth quarter to redirect support for the products to other regional brands we recorded a 48 million charge related to a biscuit trademark in our asia pacific segment and a 9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our europe segment the impairment charges were calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs we primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method which utilizes estimates of future sales growth rates royalty rates and discount rates in determining a brand’s global fair value during our 2014 intangible asset impairment review we also noted three brands with 341 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2014 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less while these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future 

refer also to note 5 goodwill and intangible assets  for additional information 

 

trade and marketing programs 

we promote our products with advertising marketing sales incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to cooperative advertising instore displays consumer promotions new product introduction fees discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred sales incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising expenses and sales incentives are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and estimated program spending we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor various employee benefit plans throughout the world these include primarily pension plans and postretirement healthcare benefits for accounting purposes we estimate the pension and postretirement healthcare benefit obligations utilizing assumptions and estimates for discount rates expected returns on plan assets expected compensation increases employeerelated factors such as turnover retirement age and mortality during 2014 we applied the new mortality tables in accounting for our us pension plans and health care cost trends we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate our assumptions also reflect our historical experiences and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations these and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans 

as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize the effect of changes in the assumptions over future periods the cost or benefit of plan changes such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on a straightline basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 

since pension and postretirement liabilities are measured on a discounted basis the discount rate significantly affects our plan obligations and expenses the expected return on plan assets assumption affects our pension plan expenses since many of our pension plans are partially funded the assumptions for discount rates and expected rates of return and our process for setting these assumptions are described in note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2015 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease on our annual benefit plan costs 

 



income taxes 

as a global company we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate the provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable in the current year the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions our provision for income taxes is significantly affected by shifts in the geographic mix of our pretax earnings across tax jurisdictions changes in tax laws and regulations tax planning opportunities available in each tax jurisdiction and the ultimate outcome of various tax audits 

 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that will apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 

we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position the amount we recognize is measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or expiration of a statute of limitations we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable however final determination of historical tax liabilities either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations could be materially different from estimates reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and historical income tax provisions the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our provision for income taxes net earnings or cash flows in the period in which the determination is made we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions 

no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested if future events such as material changes in longterm investment requirements necessitate that these earnings be distributed an additional provision for taxes may apply which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 

see note 15 income taxes  for additional information on our effective tax rate current and deferred taxes valuation allowances and unrecognized tax benefits 

contingencies 

see note 11 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

new accounting guidance 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 

commodity trends 

we regularly monitor worldwide supply commodity cost and currency trends so we can costeffectively secure ingredients packaging and fuel required for production during 2014 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were increased cocoa dairy packaging energy and coffee bean costs and higher currencyrelated costs on our commodity purchases partially offset by lower costs for sugar and grains and oils due primarily to hedging 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we generally also price to protect gross profit dollars due to competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives or other factors our pricing actions may lag commodity cost changes temporarily 

we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2015 while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that cash from operations our 45 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we expect to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt we continue to utilize our commercial paper program primarily uncommitted international credit lines and longterm debt issuances for regular funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside of the united states in venezuela we consider all undistributed earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and access to cash of 278 million in venezuela to be limited due to the uncertain economic and political environment we do not expect this limitation to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – currency translation and highly inflationary accounting  for additional information 

the cash flow activity of the kraft foods group inc discontinued operation which was divested on october 1 2012 is included within our consolidated cash flow results for periods prior to october 1 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 3562 million in 2014 6410 million in 2013 and 3923 million in 2012 the decrease in operating cash flows in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily related to our receipt of 26 billion of net cash from the resolution of the starbucks arbitration in 2013 and higher related income taxes paid in 2014 and lower relative working capital cash improvements than in 2013 as we decreased our cash conversion cycle a metric that measures working capital efficiency and utilizes days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding by 10 days in 2014 as compared to a 13 day reduction in 2013 these yearoveryear decreases were partially offset by lower interest payments in 2014 following the debt refinancing in the first quarter of 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 the increase in operating cash flows in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily related to the receipt of the 26 billion from the starbucks arbitration resolution lower spending on spinoff costs and the 20122014 restructuring program lengthening of days payables outstanding increased collection of receivables and lower interest payments 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1642 million in 2014 1483 million in 2013 and 1687 million in 2012 the increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2014 relates to lower cash inflows in 2014 to offset higher capital expenditures in 2014 in 2013 we received higher cash proceeds from property sales net proceeds from divestitures and cash from kraft foods group inc in connection with the spinoff partially offset by cash we paid for an acquisition in morocco the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 related to payments made to kraft foods group inc in 2012 in connection with the spinoff partially offset by cash we paid for the acquisition in morocco and lower proceeds from divestitures in 2013 

capital expenditures were 1642 million in 2014 1622 million in 2013 and 1610 million in 2012 the 2014 capital expenditures were funded from operating activities and were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be up to 18 billion including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and the 20142018 restructuring program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in  provided by financing activities 

net cash used in or provided by financing activities was 2688 million used in 2014 6687 million used in 2013 and 204 million provided in 2012 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in 2014 relative to 2013 was primarily due to significantly lower longterm debt repayments and lower share repurchases in 2014 offset in part by decreased proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and other shortterm borrowings and higher dividend payments in 2014 the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt higher repayment of longterm debt and repurchases of common stock partially offset by lower dividend payments reflecting our new capital structure and dividend rate following the spinoff and higher shortterm borrowings 

 

debt 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements market conditions and other factors generally in the first and second quarters of the year our working capital requirements grow increasing the need for shortterm financing the third and fourth quarters of the year typically generate higher cash flows as such we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet shortterm working capital needs 

in february 2014 our board of directors approved a 5 billion longterm financing authority that remains available as of december 31 2014 

in the next 12 months 1513 million of longterm debt will mature as follows 1029 million in march 2015 and € 400 million 484 million as of december 31 2014 in june 2015 we expect to fund these repayments with cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or additional debt 

our total debt was 167 billion at december 31 2014 and 171 billion at december 31 2013 our debttocapitalization ratio was 038 at december 31 2014 and 035 at december 31 2013 at december 31 2014 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 77 years our average daily commercial borrowings were 19 billion in 2014 10 billion in 2013 and 10 billion in 2012 we expect to continue to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for more information on our debt and debt covenants

as we operate globally we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate market risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates for additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange commodity price and interest rate exposures see note 9 financial instruments  

many of our nonus subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we translate the balance sheets operating results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting purposes the translation of nonus dollar denominated balance sheets and statements of earnings of our subsidiaries into the us dollar for consolidated reporting generally results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within equity a stronger us dollar relative to other functional currencies adversely affects our consolidated earnings and net assets while a weaker us dollar benefits our consolidated earnings and net assets while we hedge significant forecasted currency exchange transactions as well as certain net assets of nonus operations and other currency impacts we cannot fully predict or eliminate volatility arising from changes in currency exchange rates on our consolidated financial results see consolidated results of operations and results of operations by reportable segment under discussion and analysis of historical results for currency exchange effects on our financial results during 2014 for additional information on the impact of currency policies and the remeasurement of our venezuelan net monetary assets on our financial condition and results of operations also see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—currency translation and highly inflationary accounting 

we also continually monitor the market for commodities that we use in our products input costs may fluctuate widely due to international demand weather conditions government policy and regulation and unforeseen conditions to manage the input cost volatility we enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments we also pursue productivity and cost saving measures and take pricing actions when necessary to mitigate the impact of higher input costs on earnings

we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt as well as current and expected interest rates in the markets in which we raise capital our primary exposures include movements in us treasury rates corporate credit spreads london interbank offered rates “libor” euro interbank offered rate “euribor” and commercial paper rates we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions in addition to using interest rate derivatives to manage future interest payments earlier this year and in the fourth quarter of 2013 we also retired 5 billion of our longterm debt and issued 63 billion of lower borrowing cost debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our total debt as of december 31 2014 was 43 down from 48 as of december 31 2013 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments the var analysis was done separately for our currency exchange fixed income and commodity risk portfolios as of each quarter end during 2014 the instruments included in the var computation were currency exchange forwards and options for currency exchange risk debt and swaps for interest rate risk and commodity forwards futures and options for commodity risk excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in nonus subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

the var model assumes normal market conditions a 95 confidence interval and a oneday holding period a parametric deltagamma approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of calculating the fixed income currency exchange and commodity var respectively the parameters used for estimating the expected return distributions were determined by observing interest rate currency exchange and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2014 and 2013 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

 

as of december 31 2014 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss under the specified confidence interval and assuming normal market conditions from adverse movements in interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management together with our ceo and cfo evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2014 based on this evaluation the ceo and cfo concluded that due to a continued material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the accounting for income taxes our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2014 in light of this material weakness prior to filing this annual report on form 10k we undertook additional substantive procedures related to our disclosure controls including validating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used for accounting for income taxes 

these additional procedures have allowed us to conclude that notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with gaap 

status of remediation 

through december 31 2014 we made substantial progress toward remediating the material weakness in the internal control including 

 

      while significant improvement in the internal controls was made through december 31 2014 we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the new internal controls to confirm that a sustainable controlled process is fully in place as we utilized outside tax advisors and resources during 2014 to execute many of the new processes and controls we hired and continue to hire additional tax personnel across the company we have put in place processes to help ensure and we continue to confirm that sufficient knowledge transfer has occurred and that relevant personnel and processes have been in operation for a sustained period of time 

we and our board of directors are committed to maintaining a strong and sustainable internal control environment we believe that the remediation work completed to date has significantly improved our internal control over the accounting for income taxes we believe it is important to confirm that the new processes and controls that we put in place as part of the remediation are fully operational for a sufficient period of time in order to provide the company with adequate assurance of a sustainable and reliable control environment related to income tax accounting 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our ceo and cfo or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 

 

accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that 

 

    because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

management reviewed the results of its assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors based on this assessment management determined that as of december 31 2014 a material weakness in our internal control over accounting for income taxes continued to exist because of this material weakness management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 based on the coso criteria for information on the progress of the remediation of the material weakness see status of remediation above 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the errors arising from the underlying deficiencies were not material to the financial results reported in any interim or annual period for details of the current year adjustments refer to note 18 income taxes  

the control deficiencies in the aggregate could result in misstatements of the income tax accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly we have determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constituted a material weakness 

pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014 as stated in their report that appears herein 

february 20 2015 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

management together with our ceo and cfo evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2014 as outlined above we added controls to remediate the material weakness related to our accounting for income taxes there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

general 

we are one of the world’s largest snack companies with global net revenues of 353 billion and earnings from continuing operations of 23 billion in 2013 on october 1 2012 following the spinoff of our north american grocery operations to our shareholders we changed our name from kraft foods inc to mondelēz international inc to reflect our new standalone global snack food and beverage business and our vision to create a more delicious world in which to live 

we manufacture and market delicious food and beverage products for consumers in approximately 165 countries around the world our portfolio includes nine billion dollar brands— oreo  nabisco and lu biscuits milka  cadbury dairy milk and cadbury chocolates trident gum jacobs coffee and tang powdered beverage our portfolio of snack foods and refreshments also includes 53 brands that each generated annual revenues of 100 million or more in 2013 

we are proud members of the nasdaq 100 and standard  poor’s 500 our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol “mdlz” we have been incorporated in the commonwealth of virginia since 2000 

we have also been recognized for our ongoing economic environmental and social contributions and this year were listed again on the dow jones sustainability index “djsi” – world and north american indices the djsi selects the

strategy 

we intend to leverage our core strengths including market leadership positions and a significant global presence to achieve two primary goals deliver toptier financial performance and be a great place to work we plan to achieve these goals by executing five strategies 

 

  

  

  

  

 reportable segments 

effective january 1 2013 we reorganized our operations and management into five reportable operating segments 

 

      

we changed and flattened our operating structure to reflect our greater concentration of operations in highgrowth emerging markets and to further enhance collaboration across regions expedite decision making and drive greater efficiencies to fuel our growth coincident with the change in segment structure segment operating income for our north america region also changed to include all us pension plan expenses a portion of which was previously excluded from segment operating results evaluated by management as the costs were centrally managed our segment results in this annual report on form 10k reflect these changes for all periods presented 

we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources we believe this measure is most relevant to investors in order to analyze segment results and trends as further discussed in note 17 segment reporting to the consolidated financial statements segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities which are a component of cost of sales general corporate expenses which are a component of selling general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles the benefit from the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification resolution which is a component of selling general and administrative expenses gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisitionrelated costs which are a component of selling general and administrative expenses in all periods presented 

during the last three fiscal years our segments contributed to segment operating income as reflected below see note 17 segment reporting for additional information including total assets and net revenues by segment  

 



our brands span five consumer sectors 

 

     during 2013 our reportable segments contributed to our net revenues in these five consumer sectors as follows 

 



within the consumer sectors the classes of products that contributed 10 or more to consolidated net revenues were 

 



 

significant divestitures and acquisitions 

spinoff of kraft foods group 

on october 1 2012 the “distribution date” we completed the spinoff of our north american grocery business kraft foods group inc “kraft foods group” to our shareholders the “spinoff” along with our other food and beverage categories we also retained our global snacks business on october 1 2012 each of our shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 19 2012 “the record date” received one share of kraft foods group common stock for every three shares of our common stock held as of the record date the distribution was structured to be tax free to our us shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

kraft foods group became an independent public company on october 1 2012 and following the spinoff we do not beneficially own any shares of kraft foods group common stock 

the divested kraft foods group business is presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented the kraft foods group other comprehensive earnings changes in equity and cash flows are included within our consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings equity and cash flows through october 1 2012 

in order to implement the spinoff we entered into certain agreements with kraft foods group to effect our legal and structural separation govern the relationship between us and allocate various assets liabilities and obligations between us including among other things employee benefits intellectual property and taxrelated assets and liabilities see note 15 income taxes  for additional information on the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities transferred or retained in the spinoff in addition to executing the spinoff in the manner provided in the agreements in november 2012 pursuant to these agreements we paid kraft foods group 163 million related to targeted cash flows together with the 247 million of cash divested on the distribution date totaling 410 million of cash transferred to kraft foods group in connection with the spinoff to facilitate the management including final payment and resolution of certain obligations kraft foods group retained certain of our north american net trade payables and receivables we also retained approximately 140 million of workers’ compensation liabilities for claims incurred by kraft foods group employees prior to the spinoff in november 2012 we paid kraft foods group 95 million to cash settle the net trade payables and receivables in march 2013 we collected 55 million from kraft foods group related to the cash settlement of stock awards held by our respective employees at the time of the spinoff as further described in note 11 stock plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2013 a dispute over a license and supply agreement between starbucks coffee company “starbucks” and kraft foods group was resolved when an independent arbitrator issued a decision and final award that resulted in starbucks paying 28 billion for its unilateral termination of the agreement the dispute arose within the kraft foods group discontinued operation and was directed to mondelēz international as part of the spinoff recapitalization plans the net 16 billion aftertax gain on the resolution of the arbitration was recorded in earnings from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2013 see item 3 legal proceedings  and notes 2 divestitures and acquisition  and 12 commitments and contingencies  for additional information 

our results from continuing operations include onetime spinoff transaction transition and financing and related costs “spinoff costs” we have incurred to date we recorded spinoff costs of 62 million in 2013 1053 million in 2012 and 46 million in 2011 we expect to incur approximately 30 million of remaining spinoff costs in 2014 related primarily to customer service and logistics information systems and processes as well as legal costs associated with revising intellectual property and other longterm agreements see note 2 divestitures and acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the spinoff 

customers 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations in 2013 our five largest customers accounted for 150 and our ten largest customers accounted for 216 of net revenues from continuing operations in 2013 

seasonality 

demand for our products is generally balanced over the first three quarters of the year and increases in the fourth quarter primarily because of holidays and other seasonal changes 

 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives than we do and some international competitors are less susceptible to currency exchange rate fluctuations we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures 

distribution and marketing 

across our segments we generally sell our products to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we also use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

we conduct our marketing efforts through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing in onair print outdoor digital and social media ii consumer incentives such as coupons and contests and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including sugar and other sweeteners coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils and dairy in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we regularly monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can costeffectively secure ingredients and packaging required for production 

significant cost items in biscuits chocolate gum candy and many powdered beverage products are sugar and cocoa we purchase sugar and cocoa on world markets and the quality and availability of supply and changes in foreign currencies affect the prices of these commodities cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs rose significantly in the second half of 2013 due to growing demand for chocolate combined with the threat of reduced supply because of poor weather conditions in some of the major cocoa producing countries significant cost items in our biscuit products are grains primarily wheat corn and soybean oil in recent years grain costs have been affected largely by the burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel as well as other factors such as weather the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which we purchase on world markets as well as from local grower cooperatives green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products in 2013 coffee bean costs fell dramatically primarily due to increased supply and bumper crops in a few of the major coffee producing countries such as brazil significant cost items in packaging include cardboards resins and plastics and our energy costs include natural gas electricity and diesel fuel we purchase these packaging and energy commodities on world markets and within the countries where we operate supply and changes in foreign currencies affect the prices of these commodities 

during 2013 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were increased dairy packaging grains and oils and local raw material costs as well as higher foreign exchange costs on our commodity purchases these costs were partially offset by lower coffee bean costs in 2013 we generally price to protect gross profit dollars we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through higher pricing hedging and manufacturing and overhead cost control in particular for the coffee category we adjust our prices and pass through changes in green coffee costs which affect our net revenues but generally do not affect our bottomline profitability over time our pricing actions may lag commodity cost changes temporarily as competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives or other factors could affect the timing of pricing decisions we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue over the remainder of 2014 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we also use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from 

 

increases in specific raw material costs while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources however any significant constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues for a period of time 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights including trademarks patents copyrights registered designs proprietary trade secrets technology and knowhow are material to our business

we own numerous trademarks and patents in countries around the world depending on the country trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms we also have patents for a number of current and potential products our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business

from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture sale or distribution of third party products similarly we sell some products under brands we license from third parties in our agreement with kraft foods group we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spinoff 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs at december 31 2013 we had approximately 2750 food scientists chemists and engineers working primarily in 11 key technology centers east hanover new jersey whippany new jersey banbury united kingdom bournville united kingdom curitiba brazil paris france melbourne australia mexico city mexico munich germany reading united kingdom and suzhou china many of our technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and stateoftheart instruments our research and development expense was 471 million in 2013 462 million in 2012 and 511 million in 2011 

regulation 

our food products and packaging materials are subject to local national and multinational regulations comprising labeling packaging food ingredients pricing marketing and advertising privacy and related areas in addition various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing our manufacturing plants enforcing standards for selected food products grading food products inspecting manufacturing plants and warehouses and regulating trade practices related to the sale of and imposing their own labeling requirements on our food products many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to government agricultural policy and intervention these policies have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review 

throughout the countries in which we do business regulators are continually adopting new laws and implementing new regulations that affect our business and operations such as the european commission’s eu health claim regulation effective december 14 2012 that limits the number of health claims that may be made by food companies about their products and a major reform of the eu legal framework related to the protection of personal data and in the us the food safety modernization act that provides additional food safety authority to the fda we will continue to monitor developments of those new laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with these new laws and regulations will be material 

environmental regulation 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

 

in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party as of december 31 2013 our subsidiaries were involved in one active proceeding in the us under a state equivalent of cercla related to our current operations as of december 31 2013 we accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of the existing environmental remediation and our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

employees 

we employed approximately 107000 people worldwide at december 31 2013 and approximately 110000 as of december 31 2012 our business units are subject to various local national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees in accordance with european union requirements we also have established a european workers council composed of management and elected members of our workforce employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 64 of our 94000 employees outside the us and approximately 31 of our 13000 us employees most of these workers are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years we believe we generally have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations 

foreign operations 

we sell our products to consumers in approximately 165 countries at december 31 2013 we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 171 manufacturing and processing facilities in 58 countries we generated 831 of our 2013 net revenues 829 of our 2012 net revenues and 837 of our 2011 net revenues from continuing operations outside the us refer to note 17 segment reporting for additional information on our foreign operations also for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations see “risk factors” in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully when evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters described in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and snacking industry is highly competitive our principal competitors are major international food snack and beverage companies that like us operate in multiple geographic areas we compete based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of sales and marketing routes to market and distribution networks promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

competitor and customer pressures may require that we reduce our prices these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases the emergence of new distribution channels such as internet sales directly to consumers may affect customer and consumer preferences we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with worldwide recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands into new geographies and to new distribution platforms including online and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and more focus on food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or environmental and human rights risks in our supply chain could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or these matters are immaterial to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain extend and expand our brand image particularly as social media and the communications environment continue to evolve negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites whether factual or not could seriously damage our reputation and brand image across the various regions in which we operate if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation and brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company and generated 831 of our 2013 net revenues 829 of our 2012 net revenues and 837 of our 2011 net revenues outside the united states we manufacture and market our products in approximately 165 countries and have operations in more than 80 countries so we are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 

         

   in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand we could also be adversely impacted by continued instability in the banking and governmental sectors of certain countries in the european union or the dynamics associated with the federal and state debt and budget challenges in the united states all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including brazil china india mexico russia venezuela argentina ukraine the middle east and africa and southeast asia however some emerging markets have greater political economic and currency volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than more established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the fcpa and the uk bribery act or local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials including in connection with obtaining permits or engaging in other actions necessary to do business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand and improve their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets and manage associated political economic and currency volatility our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the consolidation of retail customers creates larger retailers with increased influence in the marketplace 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and our other major markets continue to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business consolidation also produces larger more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands further retail consolidation and increasing retail power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect sales and our ability to supply products to our customers 

during 2013 our five largest customers accounted for 150 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

additionally disputes with significant suppliers including those related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly or availability of commodities may become constrained 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including sugar and other sweeteners coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils and dairy in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses prices for commodities other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations political conditions severe weather the potential longerterm consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs many of the commodities we purchase are grown by smallholder farmers who might lack the capacity to invest to increase productivity or adapt to these conditions although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our enterprise risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases continued increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer as a result moreover increases in the price of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases could require us to lower our prices and thereby affect our revenues profits or margins likewise constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues if we are not successful in our mitigation activities if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or must reduce our prices or if we are limited by supply constraints our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

retailers are increasingly offering retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher value or quality to our consumers than less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as those we continue to experience consumers may not buy our products if the difference in value or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands narrows or if consumers perceive a narrowing if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or need to shift our product mix to lower margin offerings this could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production storage distribution sales advertising and marketing as well as licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations or their interpretation and application could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

we are a large food and snacking company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal tax and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to greater risk of litigation legal or tax claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover our failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations litigation legal or tax claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to product liability claims 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent risks we could decide to or be required by law or regulation to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us a related regulatory enforcement action or a widespread product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers and our results of operations 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability consistently to provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters fire explosions terrorism political unrest generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers’ confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline in addition we might not have the functions processes or organizational capability necessary to achieve on our anticipated timeframes our strategic ambition to reconfigure our supply chain and drive efficiencies to fuel growth these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers around the world and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base including by geography we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example recently consumers have increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sodium consumption we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may be unsuccessful in these efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify complete or manage strategic transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions including acquisitions divestitures joint ventures minority investments and other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives we may not successfully identify complete or manage the risks presented by these strategic transactions strategic transactions may result in the diversion of management attention from our existing business and may present financial managerial and operational risks our success depends in part upon our ability to identify suitable transactions negotiate favorable contractual terms comply with applicable regulations and receive necessary consents clearances and approvals including regulatory and antitrust clearances and approvals integrate or separate businesses realize the full extent of the benefits cost savings or synergies presented by strategic transactions effectively implement control environment processes with employees joining us as a result of transactions minimize adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers achieve accurate estimates of fair value minimize potential loss of customers or key employees and minimize indemnities and potential disputes with buyers sellers and strategic partners 

 

with respect to acquisitions and joint ventures in particular we are also exposed to potential risks based on our ability to conform standards controls policies and procedures and business cultures consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations and coordinate antitrust and competition laws in the us the european union and other jurisdictions joint ventures and strategic alliances pose additional risks as ownership and management responsibilities are shared with one or more other parties who may not have the same objectives priorities strategies or resources as we do furthermore we may not be able to complete on terms favorable to us desired or proposed divestitures of businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or our growth or profitability targets our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges or to take action to reduce costs that remain after a divestiture is completed gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may also affect our profitability 

any of these risks and challenges could materially and adversely affect our business product sales financial condition and results of operations 

failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our reputation results of operations and stock price 

the accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations these limitations include the possibility of human error inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud if we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements we could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis and our reputation results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

in connection with management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as of december 31 2013 we did not maintain effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness accuracy and presentation of our accounting for income taxes including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities we determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constitutes a material weakness see item 9a controls and procedures  for a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and the material weakness we have revised our first through third quarter 2013 and prioryear financial statements in this filing to reflect the related items in the appropriate periods although the errors are not material to any previously reported financial results if the new controls we are implementing to address the material weakness and to strengthen our overall internal control over accounting for income taxes are not designed or do not operate effectively if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following these new processes or if we are otherwise unable to remediate this material weakness we may not timely or accurately report our financial condition or results of operations this could adversely affect investor and business partner confidence in our financial reports and our stock price 

we are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 

at december 31 2013 we manufactured and marketed our products in approximately 165 countries had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 171 manufacturing and processing facilities in 58 countries a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and dividends in addition movements in currency exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations but our efforts may not be successful accordingly changes in the relative value of any two currencies that we use for transactions could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers around the world these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties or used in connection with shared service centers may be susceptible 

 

to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors natural disasters terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events furthermore any of the aforementioned impacts to our business could be prolonged to the extent such information technology systems are managed by third parties or used in connection with external shared service centers as we will have to coordinate with such third parties for the resolution of any risks presented if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results 

in addition if we are unable to prevent physical and electronic breakins cyberattacks and other information security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers suppliers or employees the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive or protected information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image misuse leakage or falsification of legally protected information could also result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations damage our reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the global capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our short and longterm credit ratings the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry will affect our access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we regularly access the us and euro commercial paper markets for ongoing funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and could raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

our inability to access the global capital markets or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs 

we sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees throughout the world at the end of 2013 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 112 billion and plan assets were 92 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate arrangements made with the trustees of certain plans and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation 

based on current tax laws we estimate our 2014 pension contributions will be approximately 319 million we also expect that our net pension cost will decrease to approximately 263 million in 2014 from 357 million in 2013 the decrease is primarily due to higher discount rates and favorable asset performance however volatility in the global capital markets may increase the risk that we are required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2014 some of our pension trust assets are invested in european sovereign debt and subject to heightened risk that they could lose value as a result of political and financial turmoil in europe 

 

due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans we may have exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees our contributions to a multiemployer plan may increase beyond our bargaining obligations depending on the financial condition of the multiemployer plan we may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to the withdrawing employer and our costs might increase as a result further if we have a partial or complete withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay an amount to the plan based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan this liability will generally increase if other employers cease participating in the plan whether or not due to bankruptcy see note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

a significant increase in our pension funding requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in the business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or manage changes in our workforce 

our continued growth requires us to hire retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage in addition increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs could adversely affect our results of operations furthermore if we are unable to manage changes in our workforce appropriately or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and our inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws in various countries as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

on december 31 2013 we had 171 manufacturing and processing facilities located in 58 countries we own 160 and lease 11 of these manufacturing and processing facilities it is our practice to maintain all of our plants and properties in good condition we believe they are suitable and adequate for our present needs 

we also had 220 distribution centers and depots worldwide we own 54 and lease 166 of these distribution centers and depots these facilities are in good condition we believe they have sufficient capacity to meet our nearterm distribution needs 

 

these facilities are located by segment as follows 

 






 item 3 legal proceedings 

we routinely are involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations “legal matters” arising in the ordinary course of our business 

a compliant and ethical corporate culture which includes adhering to laws and industry regulations in all jurisdictions in which we do business is integral to our success accordingly after we acquired cadbury in february 2010 we began reviewing and adjusting as needed cadbury’s operations in light of applicable standards as well as our policies and practices we initially focused on such high priority areas as food safety the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and antitrust based upon cadbury’s preacquisition policies and compliance programs and our postacquisition reviews our preliminary findings indicated that cadbury’s overall state of compliance was sound nonetheless through our reviews we determined that in certain jurisdictions including india there appeared to be facts and circumstances warranting further investigation we are continuing our investigations in certain jurisdictions including in india and we continue to cooperate with governmental authorities 

as we previously disclosed on february 1 2011 we received a subpoena from the sec in connection with an investigation under the fcpa primarily related to a facility in india that we acquired in the cadbury acquisition the subpoena primarily requests information regarding dealings with indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals related to the operation of that facility we are continuing to cooperate with the us and indian governments in their investigations of these matters including through preliminary meetings with the us government to discuss potential conclusion of the investigation 

on february 28 2013 cadbury india limited a subsidiary of mondelēz international and other parties received a show cause notice from the indian department of central excise authority the notice calls upon the parties to demonstrate why the authority should not collect approximately 46 million of unpaid excise tax as well as approximately 46 million of penalties and interest related to production at the same indian facility we believe that the decision to claim the excise tax benefit is valid and we are contesting the show cause notice through the administrative and judicial process 

as we previously disclosed on march 1 2011 starbucks took control of the starbucks packaged coffee business “starbucks cpg business” in grocery stores and other channels starbucks did so without our authorization and in what we contended was a violation and breach of our license and supply agreement with starbucks related to the starbucks cpg business following an initial decision in november 2013 on december 13 2013 the independent arbitrator in our dispute with starbucks issued a decision and final award that kraft foods global inc now kraft foods group the named party in the proceeding had proven that it was entitled to recover and that starbucks must pay 2764 million in total cash compensation for starbucks’ unilateral termination of the agreement the award included compensation for 135 of the determined fair market value of the agreement for improper termination as well as prejudgment interest of 521 million and kraft foods group’s attorney’s fees which the parties agreed would equal 15 million starbucks has paid all of the amount owed pursuant to the ruling under the separation and distribution agreement between kraft foods group and us kraft foods group directed the recovery awarded in the arbitration proceeding to us 

while we cannot predict with certainty the results of legal matters in which we are currently involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of these legal matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our financial results

business and segment reorganization 

effective as of january 1 2013 we reorganized our operations and management into five reportable operating segments 

 

     we changed and flattened our operating structure to reflect our greater concentration of operations in emerging markets and to further enhance collaboration across regions expedite decision making and drive greater efficiencies to fuel our growth coincident with the change in segment structure segment operating income for our north america region also changed to include all us pension plan expenses a portion of which was previously excluded from segment operating results evaluated by management as the costs were centrally managed see note 17 segment reporting for additional segment information our segment results reflect the change in segment structure for all periods presented 

spinoff of kraft foods group 

on october 1 2012 we completed the spinoff of our north american grocery business kraft foods group inc “kraft foods group” to our shareholders the “spinoff” the divested kraft foods group business is presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented the kraft foods group other comprehensive earnings changes in equity and cash flows are included within our consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings equity and cash flows through october 1 2012 see note 2 divestitures and acquisition  for more information on the spinoff of kraft foods group 

revision of financial statements 

in finalizing our 2013 results we identified certain outofperiod noncash income taxrelated errors in prior interim and annual periods these errors are not material to any previously reported financial results however we have revised our first through third quarter 2013 and prioryear financial statements in this filing to reflect these items in the appropriate periods the net effect of the revision was to lower tax expense in years prior to 2013 the impact of the revision to 2013 results through the third quarter was a 59 million reduction of net earnings related to both current and prioryear corrections the impact of the revision to fiscal years prior to 2013 was an increase in cumulative net earnings of 94 million for additional details of the adjustments see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies – revision of financial statements  the following discussion and analysis relates to revised aftertax results for all periods presented 

 

while we corrected these errors and they were not material to any previously reported financial statements we have determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements may not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis due to control deficiencies in our internal controls thus management has determined that the control deficiencies constitute a material weakness because we have identified this material weakness we have implemented additional procedures to verify the reliability of our accounting for income taxes based on the additional procedures we believe that the consolidated financial statements included in this report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for additional information on the procedures and controls we are implementing to address the material weakness see item 9a controls and procedures

 financial outlook 

we develop longterm plans and targets to achieve sustainable profitable growth over time our longterm financial targets include 

 

   refer to nongaap financial measures appearing later in this section for more information on these measures 

in 2014 we expect organic net revenues to grow approximately 4 percent which is at or above the growth of our categories we expect low doubledigit growth in adjusted operating income at constant currency fueled by our focused efforts to reduce overheads restructure our global supply chain and improve product mix while continuing to invest in emerging markets we anticipate this increase will result in an adjusted operating income margin in the high 12 percent range and will be the primary lever in delivering adjusted eps of 173 to 178 up double digits on a constant currency basis our 2014 adjusted eps outlook reflects constant currency at average 2013 currency rates any fluctuation from the 2013 average currency rates is outside of our 2014 outlook 

 

we monitor the following factors and trends that we expect could impact our near and longterm revenues and profitability 

longterm demographics and consumer trends – snack food consumption is highly correlated to gdp growth urbanization of the population and rising discretionary income levels associated with a growing middle class over the longterm we expect these trends to continue leading to growth in key consumer behaviors including increased snacking occasions greater use of convenience food and migrating to more frequent smaller meals 

demand – we monitor consumer spending and our market share within the food and beverage categories in which we sell our products in 2013 our organic net revenues grew faster than the global categories as we expanded market share in a number of the categories growth in the global categories slowed from approximately 6 in 2012 to under 4 in 2013 the slowdown in category growth is expected to impact our nearterm net revenue growth and we have reflected this in our organic net revenue outlook for 2014 we believe the slowdown in category growth particularly in emerging markets is temporary as we expect category growth to return to levels more in line with the expected growth of emerging markets and consumer spending we continue to make investments in our brands and build strong routes to market to address the needs of consumers in emerging and developed markets in doing so we anticipate stimulating demand in the categories and growing our position in these markets 

volatility of global markets – our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations particularly in emerging markets some of these markets have greater political and economic volatility and vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions as we saw this past year in some of the markets in which we sell our products including china russia brazil turkey venezuela and argentina the volatility affects demand for products and requires frequent changes in how we operate our business while there will likely be continued volatility across these and other markets in which we sell we will continue to invest in these markets as we believe the emerging markets in particular will deliver significant growth over time 

competition – our competitors continue to grow their global operations and routes to market and lowcost local manufacturers are also expanding their production capacities in the markets in which we sell our products competitors may significantly reduce prices or offer other incentives as we saw with products such as coffee this past year we continually evaluate the competitive environment and market conditions and bring new products and innovations to market we also adjust our pricing trade and promotional programs to compete and continue to focus on growing our market share 

pricing – we adjust our product prices based on a number of variables including demand the competitive environment and changes in our input costs our net revenue growth or profitability may be affected as we adjust prices to address new conditions this past year we generally increased prices modestly in response to higher commodity costs and other factors but in certain categories such as coffee we significantly decreased our prices as the cost of coffee beans fell significantly over 2013 this had a 08 percentage point pp negative impact on our organic net revenue growth in 2013 in 2014 for the commodities we purchase we anticipate slightly higher aggregate commodity costs and expect to adjust our prices accordingly 

operating costs – our operating costs include raw materials labor selling and marketing costs general and administrative expenses taxes currency impacts and financing costs we manage these costs through cost saving and productivity initiatives sourcing and hedging programs pricing actions refinancing and tax planning we continue to work on various programs to expand our profitability and margins as reflected in our 2014 outlook we expect to achieve doubledigit growth in our adjusted operating income and adjusted eps on a constant currency basis this reflects a number of cost saving programs we have put in place including our supply chain reinvention program and 20122014 restructuring program among others 

currency – as a global company with 83 of our net revenues generated outside the united states we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and currency movements we work to mitigate our currency exposure by hedging a portion of our currency exchange business transactions as well as our investments in overseas operations however we may not be able to effectively hedge against currency risks in all the countries and currencies in which we operate due to factors including limited markets for hedging currency transactions and current monetary policies and restrictions of countries such as venezuela and argentina while we work to mitigate our exposure to currencyrelated risks global market volatility actions by foreign governments and other factors outside our control could lead to unfavorable currency impacts on our earnings 

financing costs – we regularly evaluate our variable and fixedrate debt and recently refinanced 64 billion of our longterm us dollardenominated debt for lower cost longterm euro and us dollardenominated debt we continue to use lower cost short and longterm debt to finance our ongoing working capital capital and other investments dividends and share repurchases our weightedaverage interest rate on our debt as of december 31 2013 was 48 down from 58 as of december 31 2012 following the january 16 2014 30 billion note issuance and completion of the february 6 2014 tender offer and retirement of 16 billion of our longterm debt our weightedaverage interest rate on our debt was 43

20122014 restructuring program 

in 2012 our board of directors approved 15 billion of restructuring and related implementation costs “20122014 restructuring program” reflecting primarily severance asset disposals and other manufacturingrelated onetime costs the primary objective of the restructuring and implementation activities was to ensure that both mondelēz international and kraft foods group were each set up to operate efficiently and execute on our respective business strategies upon separation and in the future 

of the 15 billion of anticipated 20122014 restructuring program costs we retained approximately 925 million and kraft foods group retained the balance of the program since inception we have incurred 440 million of our estimated 925 million total 20122014 restructuring program charges 

we recorded restructuring charges of 267 million in 2013 and 102 million in 2012 within asset impairment and exit costs we also incurred implementation costs of 63 million in 2013 and 8 million in 2012 which were recorded within cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses see note 6 20122014 restructuring program  and note 10 benefit plans  for additional information 

 

integration program 

as a result of our combination with cadbury limited formerly cadbury plc or “cadbury” in 2010 we launched an integration program the “integration program” to realize expected annual cost savings of approximately 750 million by the end of 2013 and revenue synergies from investments in distribution marketing and product development we achieved cost savings of approximately 800 million one year ahead of schedule and achieved our planned revenue synergies by december 31 2013 to achieve the expected annual cost savings and synergies and integrate the two businesses we incurred total integration charges of approximately 15 billion through the end of 2013 and have now completed the integration program 

we recorded integration program charges of 216 million in 2013 185 million in 2012 and 521 million in 2011 at december 31 2013 we had an accrued liability of 145 million related to the integration program of which 101 million was recorded within other current liabilities and 44 million primarily related to leased facilities no longer in use was recorded within other longterm liabilities during 2012 we refined our estimate of 2010 integration program charges by 45 million primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur within our europe segment the reversal was based on final negotiations with local workers councils the majority of which were concluded in april 2012 we recorded integration program charges in operations as a part of selling general and administrative expenses primarily within our europe eemea asia pacific and latin america segments as well as within general corporate expenses see note 7 integration program and cost savings initiatives  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

cost savings initiatives 

cost savings initiatives generally include exit disposal and other project costs outside of our integration program and 20122014 restructuring program and consist of the following specific initiatives 

   accounting calendar changes in 2013 and 2011 

the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day of the period in connection with moving toward a common consolidation date across the company in the first quarter of 2013 we changed the consolidation date for our europe segment the change in the consolidation date for our europe segment had a favorable impact of 37 million on net revenues and 6 million on operating income in 2013 at this time primarily our north american operating subsidiaries report results as of the last saturday of the period 

prior to these changes in 2012 and 2011 the majority of our operating subsidiaries reported results as of the last saturday of the year in 2011 the last saturday of the year fell on december 31 so our 2011 results included one more week of operating results “53 rd week” than 2013 or 2012 which each had 52 weeks in 2011 we also changed the consolidation dates for certain operations of our europe latin america and eemea segments previously these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period subsequent to the 2011 changes the majority of our europe segment reported results as of the last saturday of each period and certain operations within our latin america and eemea segments began to report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last saturday of the period these changes and the 53 rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of 679 million and a favorable impact of 93 million to operating income in 2011 

we believe these changes will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries and bringing the reporting date closer to the periodend date as the effect to priorperiod results was not material we have not revised priorperiod results 

 

tender offer 

on december 18 2013 we completed a cash tender offer and retired 34 billion of our longterm us dollar debt we recorded a 612 million loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses due primarily to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment see note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for additional information 

benefit from indemnification resolution 

as part of our 2010 cadbury acquisition we became the responsible party for tax matters under the cadbury schweppes plc and dr pepper snapple group inc “dpsg” tax sharing and indemnification agreement dated may 1 2008 “tax indemnity” for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of cadbury’s americas beverage business a us federal tax audit of dpsg for the 20062008 tax years was concluded with the irs in august 2013 as a result we recorded a favorable aftertax impact of 363 million due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to dpsg under the tax indemnity we recorded 336 million in selling general and administrative expenses 49 million in interest and other expense net and 22 million of tax expense in the year ended december 31 2013 

provision for income taxes 

our income tax provision could be significantly affected by a shift in pretax income between foreign jurisdictions from foreign jurisdictions to the us or by changes in foreign or us tax laws and regulations that apply to the earnings of foreign subsidiaries as well as other factors 

our 2013 effective tax rate of 25 was favorably impacted by the mix of pretax income in various foreign jurisdictions net tax benefits from discrete onetime events and the nontaxable portion of the cadbury acquisition related indemnification resolution partially offset by an unfavorable tax law change the 299 million of discrete onetime events primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions and the net reduction of uk deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2013 that reduced uk corporate income tax rates 

our 2012 revised effective tax rate of 95 was favorably impacted by the mix of pretax income in various foreign jurisdictions and net tax benefits from discrete onetime tax events partially offset by nondeductible expenses the 140 million of discrete onetime events primarily related to the net reduction of uk deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2012 that reduced uk corporate income tax rates and net favorable tax audit settlements 

our 2011 revised effective tax rate of 62 was favorably impacted by the mix of pretax income in various foreign jurisdictions and net tax benefits of 253 million from discrete onetime events primarily from the net reduction of uk deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted in 2011 that reduced uk corporate income tax rates the net favorable impact from tax audit developments during the year the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets that are now expected to be realized and adjustments to taxes payable as a result of tax return filings

 organic net revenues growth was driven by favorable volumemix and higher net pricing favorable volumemix was driven primarily by higher shipments across all segments except asia pacific higher net pricing in latin america primarily related to venezuela argentina and brazil and in north america was partially offset by lower net pricing in europe asia pacific and eemea primarily due to lower coffee prices unfavorable foreign currency decreased net revenues by 837 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar and the strength of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies including the brazilian real argentinean peso australian dollar indian rupee japanese yen and south african rand partially offset by the strength of the euro relative the us dollar the impact of divestitures resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 345 million in addition the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco added 91 million in net revenues and the accounting calendar change in europe added 37 million in net revenues in 2013

  favorable volumemix was driven primarily by volume gains across all segments except for asia pacific during 2013 increased input costs outpaced higher net pricing the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs in part due to higher foreign exchange transaction costs on imported materials partially offset by lower manufacturing costs higher net pricing in latin america and north america was partially offset by lower net pricing in europe asia pacific and eemea primarily due to lower coffee pricing total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 497 million from 2012 due in part to lower spinoff costs a benefit from the resolution of the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification a favorable foreign currency impact net of the negative impact from the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela gains on the sales of properties in 2013 and the impact of businesses divested in 2013 and 2012 which were partially offset by gains on sales of properties in 2012 higher integration program costs higher 20122014 restructuring program costs and the inclusion of expenses related to the acquired biscuit operations in morocco excluding these factors selling general and administrative expenses increased 246 million from 2012 driven primarily by higher overhead costs in emerging markets including investments in sales capabilities and routetomarket expansion in emerging markets the 2012 reversal of reserves carried over from the cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer required prioryear proceeds from insurance settlements and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in asia pacific eemea and latin america in 2013 we divested properties in europe and india and recorded pretax gains of 68 million in 2012 we divested properties in russia and turkey and recorded pretax gains of 77 million the change in unrealized gainslosses added 61 million in operating income for 2013 within asset impairment and exit costs we also recorded in 2012 an asset impairment charge of 52 million related to a trademark in japan the acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco added 16 million in operating income for 2013 accounting calendar changes that went into effect in europe in the first quarter of 2013 increased operating income by 6 million unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by 200 million due primarily to the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar including the 54 million devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela and the strength of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies including the brazilian real argentinean peso indian rupee japanese yen south african rand and russian ruble partially offset by the strength of the euro relative to the us dollar 

operating income margin increased from 104 in 2012 to 112 in 2013 adjusted operating income margin decreased from 122 in 2012 to 120 in 2013 the decrease in adjusted operating income margin was driven primarily by a modest decline in gross margin due to the timing of price increases to cover rising foreign exchange transaction costs on imported raw materials in the second half of the year and the unfavorable currency impact due to the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela partially offset by the benefit of leverage on our selling general and administrative expenses 

 

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international – net earnings attributable to mondelēz international of 3915 million increased by 848 million 276 in 2013 diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international was 219 in 2013 up 048 281 from 171 in 2012 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to mondelēz international was 129 in 2013 up 041 466 from 088 in 2012 adjusted eps 1 was 151 in 2013 up 010 71 from 141 in 2012 adjusted eps on a constant currency basis 1 was 160 in 2013 up 019 135 from 141 in 2012 these changes shown net of tax below were due to the following

 organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volumemix higher net pricing including the impact of pricing actions from the prior year was realized across all reportable segments as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs favorable volumemix was driven by higher shipments in asia pacific eemea and europe partially offset by lower shipments in north america driven primarily by the completion of a comanufacturing agreement from a previous divestiture and latin america unfavorable foreign currency decreased net revenues by 1576 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies primarily the euro brazilian real indian rupee argentinean peso south african rand russian ruble and mexican peso accounting calendar changes in 2011 resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 679 million the impact of divestitures also resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 72 million

  higher net pricing including the impact of pricing actions taken in the prior year outpaced increased input costs during 2012 the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs partially offset by lower manufacturing costs favorable volumemix was driven by strong contributions from europe asia pacific and eemea partially offset by an unfavorable impact in north america and latin america total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 206 million from 2011 including the benefits from a favorable impact of foreign currency on expenses lower integration program costs including the reversal of previously accrued integration program charges primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur higher expenses in the prior year related to accounting calendar changes divested businesses and a gain on the sale of a property in russia which were partially offset by the spinoff costs and 20122014 restructuring program costs incurred in 2012 excluding these factors selling general and administrative expenses increased 293 million from 2011 driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in each of the geographic units partially offset by the reversal of reserves carried over from the cadbury acquisition in 2010 and no longer required accounting calendar changes made in 2011 including the 53 rd week of shipments in 2011 decreased operating income by 93 million in 2012 we divested property located in russia and recorded a pretax gain of 55 million in addition we divested properties located in turkey in 2012 and in 2011 which had an immaterial yearoveryear impact on operating income during 2012 we recorded 52 million related to a trademark impairment in japan the change in unrealized gains  losses on hedging activities increased operating income by 37 million as we recognized gains of 1 million in 2012 versus losses of 36 million in 2011 unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by 153 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies primarily the euro brazilian real argentinean peso and indian rupee partially offset by the impact of adjustments in the prior year related to the highly inflationary venezuelan economy 

operating income margin increased from 98 in 2011 to 104 in 2012 adjusted operating income margin increased from 115 in 2011 to 122 in 2012 the increase in adjusted operating income margin was due primarily to a modest increase in gross margin reflecting the impact of pricing actions net of increased input costs and the favorable change in unrealized gains on hedging activities and overhead leverage partially offset by the impact of higher advertising and consumer promotion costs

results of operations by reportable segment 

effective january 1 2013 we reorganized our operations and management into five reportable operating segments 

 

     we changed and flattened our operating structure to reflect our greater concentration of operations in highgrowth emerging markets and to further enhance collaboration across regions expedite decision making and drive greater efficiencies to fuel our growth we have presented our segment results reflecting the changes for all periods presented 

we manage the operations within latin america asia pacific and eemea by location and europe and north america by product category 

the following discussion compares our segment results from continuing operations for the following periods 

 



as discussed in note 17 segment reporting  we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends coincident with the change in reportable segment structure segment operating income for our north america region also changed to include all us pension plan expenses a portion of which was previously excluded from segment operating results evaluated by management as the costs were centrally managed segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities which are a component of cost of sales general corporate expenses which are a component of selling general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles the benefit from the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification resolution which is a component of selling general and administrative expenses gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisitionrelated costs which are a component of 

 

selling general and administrative expenses in all periods presented we exclude unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities general corporate expenses amortization of intangibles the benefit from the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification resolution gains and losses on divestitures and acquisitions and acquisitionrelated costs from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results furthermore we centrally manage interest and other expense net accordingly we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews 

in connection with our 20122014 restructuring program we recorded restructuring charges of 267 million in 2013 and 102 million in 2012 in operations as a part of asset impairment and exit costs we also recorded implementation costs of 63 million in 2013 and 8 million in 2012 in operations as a part of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses these charges were recorded primarily within our eemea europe and north america segments 

we recorded integration program charges of 216 million in 2013 185 million in 2012 and 521 million in 2011 at december 31 2013 101 million of our net integration program liability was recorded within other current liabilities and 44 million primarily related to leased facilities no longer in use was recorded within other longterm liabilities during 2012 within our europe segment we refined our estimate of 2010 integration program charges by 45 million primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur upon concluding the majority of local workers council negotiations in april 2012 we recorded charges in the integration program in operations as a part of selling general and administrative expenses primarily within our europe asia pacific latin america and eemea segments as well as within general corporate expenses 

in 2012 we recorded a 44 million benefit within our europe segment related to the reversal of reserves carried over from the cadbury acquisition in 2010 which was subsequently determined to not be required 

in 2013 we acquired the remaining interest in a biscuit operation in morocco which is now a whollyowned subsidiary within our eemea segment we incurred acquisitionrelated costs of 7 million which were recorded within selling general and administrative expenses and interest and other expense net in 2013 we also recorded integration charges of 4 million within the segment operating income of eemea related to our acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco we recorded these charges in selling general and administrative expenses within our eemea segment there were no significant acquisitions in 2012 or 2011 

in 2013 we received cash proceeds of 60 million and pretax gains of 8 million for divestitures in turkey south africa and spain 

in 2012 we completed several divestitures within our europe segment which generated cash proceeds of 200 million and pretax gains of 107 million the divestitures primarily included a dinners and sauces grocery business in germany and belgium and a canned meat business in italy in 2011 there were no significant divestitures 

in 2013 we sold properties in italy the united kingdom and norway within our europe segment and in india within our asia pacific segment the europe property sales generated 29 million in pretax net gains and 37 million of cash proceeds we also have a 52 million receivable related to the united kingdom property sale the india property sale generated a 39 million pretax gain and 53 million of cash proceeds the gains were recorded within selling general and administrative expenses and cash proceeds were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities in the year ended december 31 2013 

in 2012 we sold property in russia and turkey within our eemea segment the turkey property sale generated a 22 million pretax gain and 29 million of cash proceeds and the russia property sale generated a 55 million pretax gain and 72 million of cash proceeds the gains were recorded within selling general and administrative expenses and the cash proceeds from the sales were recorded in cash flows from other investing activities 

on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the official venezuelan bolivar exchange rate from 430 bolivars to 630 bolivars to the us dollar and the elimination of the secondtier governmentregulated sitme exchange rate previously applied to value certain types of transactions in connection with the announced changes we recorded a 54 million unfavorable foreign currency charge related to the devaluation of our net monetary assets in venezuela the charge was recorded in selling general and administrative expenses within our latin america segment we also incurred net unfavorable devaluationrelated foreign currency impacts within our pretax earnings of 67 million during the year ended december 31 2013 related to translating the earnings of our venezuelan subsidiary to the us dollar at the new exchange rate during 2012 and 2011 we recorded immaterial foreign currency impacts in connection with highly inflationary accounting for venezuela 

 

on march 19 2013 the venezuelan government announced a new auctionbased currency transaction program referred to as sicad sicad allows entities in specific sectors to bid for us dollars to be used for specified import transactions the minimum exchange rate to be offered under sicad is 630 bolivars to the us dollar as of the week ended december 30 2013 the published sicad rate offered was 1130 bolivars to the us dollar to date availability of us dollars at either exchange rate continues to be limited 

on january 24 2014 the venezuelan government announced the expansion of the sicad auction program to prospective dividends and royalties and new profit margin controls as our venezuelan subsidiaries declare dividends or pay royalties in the future based on the availability of us dollars exchanged under the sicad program the realized exchange losses on payments made in us dollars would be recognized in earnings on profit level controls we continue to evaluate the announced measures and will look to protect net revenues and profitability 

in light of the current difficult macroeconomic environment in venezuela we continue to monitor and actively manage our investment and exposures in venezuela in 2013 our net revenues in venezuela were approximately 800 million at december 31 2013 our net monetary assets denominated in the venezuelan bolivar were 257 million in us dollars applying the official exchange rate if the official exchange rate were to devalue further or if the currently less favorable sicad exchange rate were extended to apply to a greater portion of our net monetary assets in venezuela we could recognize a material devaluation charge in earnings we continue to monitor the currency developments in venezuela and take protective measures against currency devaluation such as converting monetary assets into nonmonetary assets which we can use in our business 

on january 23 2014 the central bank of argentina adjusted its currency policy removed its currency stabilization measures and allowed the argentine peso exchange rate to float relative to the us dollar the value of the argentine peso relative to the us dollar fell by 15 on that day and further volatility in the exchange rate is likely at this time based on the current state of argentine currency rules and regulations the business environment remains challenging however we do not expect the existing controls and restrictions to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in 2013 our net revenues in argentina were approximately 800 million we continue to monitor developments in argentina and explore additional measures to protect our operations and net monetary position there 

net changes in unrealized gains  losses relate to currency and commodity hedging activity and were 62 million in 2013 1 million in 2012 and 36 million in 2011 once the unrealized gains or losses become realized and the hedged item affects earnings the realized gains or losses are reclassified to segment operating income 

the 2013 decrease in general corporate expenses was due primarily to lower spinoff costs and lower corporate functions and project expenses spinoff costs decreased 345 million from 407 to 62 million and corporate functions and project expenses decreased 69 million from 277 million to 208 million the 2012 increase in general corporate expenses was due primarily to 407 million of spinoff costs recorded within general corporate expenses partially offset by lower integration program costs 

as part of our 2010 cadbury acquisition we became the responsible party for tax matters under the cadbury schweppes plc and dr pepper snapple group inc “dpsg” tax sharing and indemnification agreement dated may 1 2008 “tax indemnity” for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of cadbury’s americas beverage business a us federal tax audit of dpsg for the 20062008 tax years was concluded with the irs in august 2013 as a result we recorded a favorable impact of 336 million in selling general and administrative expenses and 49 million in interest and other expense net for a total pretax impact of 385 million 363 million net of tax in 2013 due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to dpsg under the tax indemnity 

the 2013 decrease in interest and other expense net was due primarily to the absence of spinoff costs within interest expense as we recorded 609 million of spinoff costs within interest expense in 2012 a reduction of longterm debt and a benefit from the cadbury acquisitionrelated indemnification resolution this was partially offset by a loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses of 612 million recorded within interest expense the 2012 increase in interest and other expense net was due primarily to 609 million of spinoff costs recorded within interest expense partially offset by a 2011 loss of 157 million related to several interest rate swaps that were settled in 2011 as well as lower longterm debt interest expense

critical accounting policies 

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include mondelēz international as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence 2050 ownership interest under the equity method of accounting we use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20 and in which we do not exercise significant influence noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of mondelēz international all intercompany transactions are eliminated 

accounting calendar changes 

in 2013 the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day of the period in connection with moving to this common consolidation date in the first quarter of 2013 we changed the consolidation date for our europe segment from the last saturday of each period to the last calendar day of each period the change in the consolidation date for our europe segment had a favorable impact of 37 million on net revenues and 6 million on operating income in 2013 at this time primarily our north american operating subsidiaries continue to report results as of the last saturday of the period 

prior to these changes in 2012 and 2011 the majority of our operating subsidiaries reported results as of the last saturday of the year in 2011 the last saturday of the year also fell on december 31 and so our 2011 results included one more week of operating results “53 rd week” than 2013 or 2012 which each had 52 weeks in 2011 we also changed the consolidation dates for certain operations of our europe latin america and eemea segments previously these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period subsequent to the 2011 changes the majority of our europe segment reported results as of the last saturday of each period and certain operations within our latin america and eemea segments began to report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last saturday of the period these changes and the 53 rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of 679 million and a favorable impact of 93 million to operating income in 2011 

we believe these changes will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries and bringing the reporting dates closer to the periodend date as the effect to priorperiod results was not material we have not revised priorperiod results 

use of estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions include among others pension and benefit plan assumptions valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets useful lives of longlived assets marketing program accruals insurance and selfinsurance reserves and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts became known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market we value all our inventories using the average cost method we also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes 

longlived assets 

we review longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of assets held for use we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

 

in connection with our 20122014 restructuring program we recorded impairment charges of 91 million in 2013 and 18 million in 2012 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets  

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually on october 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk by first performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors for each reporting unit if significant potential goodwill impairment risk exists for a specific reporting unit we apply a twostep quantitative test the first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a 20year projection of discounted cash flows which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value for reporting units within our north america and europe geographic units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 66 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our latin america asia pacific and eemea reporting units we used a riskrated discount rate of 96 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value 

in 2013 2012 and 2011 there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2013 annual impairment testing we noted one reporting unit which was more sensitive to nearterm changes in discounted cash flow assumptions us confections with 2177 million of goodwill as of december 31 2013 and fair value in excess of its carrying value of net assets of 12 while the reporting unit passed the first step of the impairment test if the segment operating income or another valuation assumption were to deteriorate significantly in the future it could adversely affect the estimated fair value if we are unsuccessful in our plans to increase the profitability of this business the estimated fair value could decline and lead to a potential goodwill impairment in the future 

we test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by first performing a qualitative review by assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific nonamortizable intangible asset we quantitatively test for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets is determined using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to its estimated fair value we record intangible asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs 

during our 2013 and 2011 reviews of nonamortizable intangible assets there were no impairments identified during our 2013 impairment testing we noted 7 brands with 511 million of aggregate book value as of december 31 2013 and fair value in excess of book value of 10 or less while these intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and though we believe that our current plans for each of these brands will allow them to continue to not be impaired if expectations are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then a brand or brands might become impaired in the future in 2012 we recorded 52 million of charges related to a trademark on a japanese chewing gum product within our asia pacific segment 

insurance and selfinsurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation general liability automobile liability product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits we estimate the liabilities associated with these risks by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers our shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales a provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts is also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized 

 

marketing and research and development 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred advertising expense was 1721 million in 2013 1815 million in 2012 and 1860 million in 2011 we expense product research and development costs as incurred research and development expense was 471 million in 2013 462 million in 2012 and 511 million in 2011 we record marketing and research and development expenses within selling general and administrative expenses 

environmental costs 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party as of december 31 2013 and 2012 our subsidiaries were involved in one active proceeding in the us under a state equivalent of cercla related to our current operations as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of the existing environmental remediation and our compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

employee benefit plans 

we provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees depending on jurisdictions tenure presence of a union job level and other factors these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits consisting primarily of severance we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries refer to note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 

in connection with the spinoff we transferred to kraft foods group the plan liabilities and assets associated with the kraft foods group active and retired employees and certain of our retired employees that previously participated in our north american benefit plans at october 1 2012 we transferred benefit plan liabilities of 12218 million pension plan assets of 6550 million accumulated other comprehensive losses net of tax of 3810 million and 2146 million of related deferred tax assets 

we recorded the following amounts in earnings from continuing operations for employee benefit plans during the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 



 

the 2013 net expense for employee benefit plans of 519 million decreased by 88 million and was primarily related to certain benefit plan obligations transferred to kraft foods group in the spinoff and other 2012 onetime costs partially offset by increased benefit plan expenses in 2013 due to lower discount rates the 2012 net expense for employee benefit plans of 607 million increased by 89 million and was primarily related to higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences related to the us and nonus pension plans 

we expect our 2014 net expense for employee benefit plans to decrease by approximately 95 million primarily due to higher discount rates and favorable asset performance 

in 2013 other comprehensive losses included 713 million of net actuarial pretax gains primarily related to the increase in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2013 90 basis point increase for us plans and 19 basis point increase for nonus plans and favorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets as well as the increase in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2013 90 basis point increase for us plans and 73 basis point increase for our nonus plans in 2012 other comprehensive losses included 2266 million of net actuarial pretax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2012 65 basis point decrease for us plans and 81 basis point decrease for nonus plans and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2012 50 basis point decrease for us plans and 21 basis point decrease for nonus plans in 2011 other comprehensive losses included 2333 million of net actuarial pretax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2011 68 basis point decrease for us plans and 49 basis point decrease for nonus plans unfavorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2011 60 basis point decrease for us plans and 73 basis point decrease for nonus plans 

in 2013 we contributed 178 million to our us pension plans and 330 million to our nonus pension plans in addition employees contributed 20 million to our nonus plans of our 2013 pension contributions 163 million was voluntary we make contributions to our us and nonus pension plans primarily to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability 

in 2014 we estimate that our pension contributions will be 10 million to our us plans and 309 million to our nonus plans based on current tax laws of the total 2014 pension contributions none is expected to be voluntary our actual contributions may be different due to many factors including changes in tax and other benefit laws significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates or other factors 

for salaried and nonunion hourly employees hired in the us after january 1 2009 we discontinued benefits under our us pension plans and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan additionally we will be freezing the us pension plans for current salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective december 31 2019 

for our postretirement plans our 2014 health care cost trend rate assumption decreased to 700 from 750 for our us postretirement plans and decreased to 476 from 647 for our nonus postretirement plans we established these rates based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 50 for us plans by 2018 and 554 for nonus plans by 2019 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on our costs and obligation as of december 31 2013 

 



 

our 2014 discount rate assumption increased to 510 from 420 for our us postretirement plans and increased to 481 from 408 for our nonus postretirement plans our 2014 discount rate increased to 510 from 420 for our us pension plans and increased to 400 from 381 for our nonus pension plans we model us canadian eurozone and united kingdom discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations we developed the discount rates for the remaining nonus plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2014 expected rate of return on plan assets remained constant at 775 for our us pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments our 2014 expected rate of return on plan assets increased to 618 from 608 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2014 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease in cost as of december 31 2013 

 



financial instruments 

we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results a principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates principally through the use of derivative instruments 

we use a combination of primarily foreign currency forward contracts futures options and swaps commodity forward contracts futures and options and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 9 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use 

we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets or other current liabilities due to their relatively shortterm duration cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge to the extent that the hedge is effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the related hedged asset or liability are recorded in earnings in the same period we use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates with changes in the value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses 

 

in order to qualify for hedge accounting a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period we must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for a hedge of a forecasted transaction the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur if it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings 

when we use derivatives we are exposed to credit and market risks credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments 

income taxes 

we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when uncertain tax positions are assessed more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement

we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

commodity trends 

we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including sugar and other sweeteners coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils and dairy in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we regularly monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can costeffectively secure ingredients and packaging required for production 

significant cost items in biscuits chocolate gum candy and many powdered beverage products are sugar and cocoa we purchase sugar and cocoa on world markets and the quality and availability of supply and changes in foreign currencies affect the prices of these commodities cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs rose significantly in the second half of 2013 due to growing demand for chocolate combined with the threat of reduced supply because of poor weather conditions in some of the major cocoa producing countries significant cost items in our biscuit products are grains primarily wheat corn and soybean oil in recent years grain costs have been affected largely by the burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel as well as other factors such as weather the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which we purchase on world markets as well as from local grower cooperatives green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products in 2013 coffee bean costs fell dramatically primarily due to increased supply and bumper crops in a few of the major coffee producing countries such as brazil significant cost items in packaging include cardboards resins and plastics and our energy costs include natural gas electricity and diesel fuel we purchase these packaging and energy commodities on world markets and within the countries where we operate supply and changes in foreign currencies affect the prices of these commodities 

during 2013 the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were increased dairy packaging grains and oils and local raw material costs as well as higher foreign exchange costs on our commodity purchases these costs were partially offset by lower coffee bean costs in 2013 we generally price to protect gross profit dollars we address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through higher pricing hedging and manufacturing and overhead cost control in particular for the coffee category we adjust our prices and pass through changes in green coffee costs which affect our net revenues but generally do not affect our bottomline profitability over time our pricing actions may lag commodity cost changes temporarily as competitive or market conditions planned trade or promotional incentives or other factors could affect the timing of pricing decisions we expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue over the remainder of 2014 

a number of external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we also use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity costs and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs while the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources however any significant constraints in the supply of key commodities may limit our ability to grow our net revenues for a period of time 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our cash from operations our new 45 billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper program and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt we continue to utilize our commercial paper program primarily uncommitted international credit lines and longterm debt issuances for regular funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity including the indefinite reinvestment of our foreign earnings 

the cash flow activity of the kraft foods group discontinued operation which was divested on october 1 2012 is included within our consolidated cash flow results for periods prior to october 1 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 6410 million in 2013 3923 million in 2012 and 4520 million in 2011 the increase in operating cash flows in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily related to the receipt of 26 billion of net cash received from the resolution of the starbucks arbitration lower spending on spinoff costs and the 20122014 restructuring program lengthening of days payables are outstanding increased collection of receivables and lower interest payments the decrease in operating cash flows in 2012 relative to 2011 was primarily related to higher spending associated with spinoff costs and the 20122014 restructuring program partially offset by lower net working capital costs primarily related to favorable inventory positions due to higher inventory costs in 2011 and favorable accounts payable positions partially offset by increased receivables 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1483 million in 2013 1687 million in 2012 and 1728 million in 2011 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 related to payments made to kraft foods group in 2012 related to the spinoff partially offset by cash paid net of cash received in connection with the 2013 acquisition of a biscuit operation in morocco and lower proceeds on divestitures in 2013 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2012 relative to 2011 related to proceeds received from our divested businesses and lower capital expenditures in the current year partially offset by cash transferred to kraft foods group related to the spinoff 

capital expenditures which were funded by operating activities and include expenditures for kraft foods group in all periods prior to october 1 2012 were 1622 million in 2013 1610 million in 2012 and 1771 million in 2011 the 2013 capital expenditures were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2014 capital expenditures to be up to 20 billion including capital expenditures required for investments in systems and the 20122014 restructuring program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in  provided by financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 6645 million in 2013 204 million provided in 2012 and 3175 million used in 2011 the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2013 relative to 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt higher repayment of longterm debt and repurchase of common stock partially offset by lower dividend payments reflecting our new capital structure and dividend rate following the spinoff and higher shortterm borrowings the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2012 relative to 2011 was primarily due to higher proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt including notes issued by kraft foods group in june 2012 for which we retained the proceeds offset by higher longterm debt repayments the net cash used in 2011 primarily related to 2043 million in dividends paid 1114 million in longterm debt repayments and 565 million in repayments of shortterm borrowings partially offset by 492 million in primarily proceeds from stock option exercises within other financing activities 

borrowing arrangements

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 12 commitments and contingencies  we enter into thirdparty guarantees primarily to cover the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of these transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2013 we had no material thirdparty guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet

as part of our 2010 cadbury acquisition we became the responsible party for tax matters under the cadbury schweppes plc and dr pepper snapple group inc “dpsg” tax sharing and indemnification agreement dated may 1 2008 “tax indemnity” for certain 2007 and 2008 transactions relating to the demerger of cadbury’s americas beverage business a us federal tax audit of dpsg for the 20062008 tax years was concluded with the irs in august 2013 as a result we recorded a favorable impact of 336 million in selling general and administrative expenses and 49 million in interest and other expense net for a total pretax impact of 385 million 363 million net of tax in 2013 due to the reversal of the accrued liability in excess of the amount we paid to dpsg under the tax indemnity 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2013 

 



 

      

nongaap financial measures 

we use nongaap financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional transparency on how we evaluate our business we use certain nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we disclose nongaap financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance 

our nongaap financial measures reflect how we evaluate our operating results currently as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change over time 

 

   we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures may vary among other companies the nongaap financial measures presented in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below which have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables which reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k because gaap financial measures on a forwardlooking basis are neither accessible nor deemed to be significantly different from the nongaap financial measures and reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort we have not provided this information in connection with the nongaap financial measures in our financial outlook 

 

organic net revenues 

using the definition of “organic net revenues” above the only adjustments made to “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures integration program costs accounting calendar changes including the 53 rd week in 2011 and foreign currency we believe that organic net revenues better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results 

 



 

  

adjusted operating income

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to crosshedge a commodity exposure we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 9 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures and currency risks associated with highly inflationary economies 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments we included our debt foreign currency forwards and futures swaps and options and commodity futures forwards and options in our var computation excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we used a “variance  covariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2013 and 2012 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2013 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were 

 

 with the spinoff a significant portion of our primarily us derivative instruments were divested in the fourth quarter of 2012 the impacts presented in the table above have not been recast to reflect the divestiture for periods prior to the spinoff as it is impracticable to do so this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results 

 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management together with our ceo and cfo evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2013 based on their evaluation the ceo and cfo concluded that due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2013 in light of the weakness in internal control over financial reporting prior to filing this annual report on form 10k we completed substantive procedures including validating and in certain cases correcting the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used for accounting for income taxes 

these additional procedures have allowed us to conclude that notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with gaap 

report of management on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our ceo and cfo or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that 

 

    because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

 

management reviewed the results of its assessment with the audit committee of our board of directors based on this assessment management determined that as of december 31 2013 a material weakness in our internal control over accounting for income taxes existed as further described below 

because of this material weakness management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 based on criteria described in internal control—integrated framework 1992 issued by coso 

as of december 31 2013 we did not maintain effective monitoring and oversight of controls over the completeness accuracy and presentation of our accounting for income taxes including the income tax provision and related tax assets and liabilities the underlying control deficiencies resulted in inconsistent reconciliation of account balances errors in the calculation of certain deferred tax balances inaccurate information used to assess uncertain tax positions and incorrect balance sheet classification of certain balances 

the errors arising from the underlying deficiencies are not material to the financial results reported in any interim or annual period for additional details of the adjustments see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies—revision of financial statements  these control deficiencies in the aggregate could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected accordingly we have determined that the ineffective monitoring and oversight of controls over income tax accounting constitutes a material weakness 

pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 as stated in their report which appears herein 

march 3 2014 

remediation of the material weakness 

we are implementing the following specific controls to address the material weakness and to strengthen our overall internal control over accounting for income taxes 

 

    we and our board of directors are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believe that these remediation efforts will represent significant improvements in our controls we have implemented many of these steps however some of these steps will take time to be fully integrated and confirmed to be effective and sustainable additional controls may also be required over time as such the identified material weakness in internal control will not be considered fully addressed until the internal controls over the income tax process have been in operation for a sufficient period of time for our management to conclude that the material weakness has been fully remediated 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

management together with our ceo and cfo evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2013 as outlined above we are in the process of adding controls to remediate the material weakness related to our accounting for income taxes there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended december 31 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

 item 1 business 

general 

mondelēz international is one of the world’s largest snack companies with global net revenues of 350 billion and earnings from continuing operations of 16 billion in 2012 beginning on october 1 2012 following the spinoff of our north american grocery operations to our shareholders the “spinoff” mondelēz international is a “new” company in name and strategy yet we carry forward the values of our legacy organization and the heritage of our iconic brands 

our vision is to create delicious moments of joy  we support this vision by manufacturing and marketing delicious food and beverage products for consumers in approximately 165 countries around the world 

we are a global snacks powerhouse  we hold leading market shares in every category and every region of the world in which we compete we hold the no 1 position globally in biscuits chocolate candy and powdered beverages as well as the no 2 position in gum and coffee our portfolio includes nine brands with annual revenues exceeding 1 billion each including oreo  nabisco and lu biscuits milka cadbury dairy milk and cadbury chocolates trident gum jacobs coffee and tang powdered beverage in addition our portfolio of snack foods and refreshments includes 52 brands which each generated annual revenues of more than 100 million in 2012 

upon completing the spinoff of kraft foods group inc we changed our name from kraft foods inc to mondelēz international inc our name reflects our vision to create a more delicious world in which to live following the spinoff on october 2 2012 our shares began to trade on the nasdaq global select market under the new symbol “mdlz” we remain incorporated in the commonwealth of virginia since 2000 and we continue to be a proud member of the standard  poor’s 500 and the dow jones sustainability index for more information on the spinoff of kraft foods group  see significant divestitures and acquisitions below and note 2 divestitures and acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 

  

strategy 

as a global snacks powerhouse we intend to leverage our core strengths including market leadership positions across our categories and a significant presence in every geography to achieve two primary goals deliver toptier financial performance and be a great place to work we plan to achieve these goals by executing five strategies 

 

     reportable segments 

we manage our global business and report operating results through three geographic units developing markets europe and north america in connection with the divestiture of kraft foods group we divested and no longer report on the following segments within our results from continuing operations us beverages us cheese us convenient meals and us grocery our remaining businesses within north america are predominantly snacks businesses our segment results in this annual report on form 10k reflect these changes for all periods presented 

beginning in 2013 our segment structure will change in december 2012 we announced a reorganization of our business and reporting structure following the spinoff effective january 1 2013 our operations management and segments will be reorganized into five operating segments asia pacific eastern europe middle east  africa “eemea” europe latin america and north america accordingly we will begin to report on our new segment structure during the first quarter of 2013 and reflect the change for all the historical periods we present 

we use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources we believe this measure is most relevant to investors in order to analyze segment results and trends as further discussed in note 16 segment reporting to the consolidated financial statements segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities which are a component of cost of sales certain components of our us pension plan cost which are a component of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses gains  losses on divestitures acquisitionrelated costs which are a component of selling general and administrative expenses general corporate expenses which are a component of selling general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles 

  

during the last three fiscal years our segments contributed to segment operating income as reflected below see note 16 segment reporting for additional information including total assets and net revenues by segment  

 



our brands span five consumer sectors 

 

     during 2012 our reportable segments participated in these five consumer sectors as follows

significant divestitures and acquisitions 

spinoff of kraft foods group 

on october 1 2012 the “distribution date” we completed the spinoff of our north american grocery business kraft foods group inc “kraft foods group” to our shareholders the “spinoff” along with our other food and beverage categories we also retained our global snacks business the “global snacks business” on october 1 2012 each of our shareholders of record as of the close of business on september 19 2012 “the record date” received one share of kraft foods group common stock for every three shares of our common stock held as of the record date the distribution was structured to be tax free to our us shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

kraft foods group is now an independent public company and following the spinoff we do not beneficially own any shares of kraft foods group common stock 

the divested kraft foods group business is presented as a discontinued operation on the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented the kraft foods group balance sheet other comprehensive earnings and cash flows are included within our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of equity comprehensive earnings and cash flows through october 1 2012 

  

in order to implement the spinoff we entered into certain agreements with kraft foods group to effect our legal and structural separation govern the relationship between us and allocate various assets liabilities and obligations between us including among other things employee benefits intellectual property and taxrelated assets and liabilities see note 14 income taxes  for additional information on the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities transferred or retained in the spinoff in addition to executing the spinoff in the manner provided in the agreements in november 2012 pursuant to these agreements we paid kraft foods group 163 million related to targeted cash flows together with the 247 million of cash divested on the distribution date totaling 410 million of cash transferred to kraft foods group in connection with the spinoff to facilitate the management including final payment and resolution of certain obligations kraft foods group retained certain of our north american net trade payables and receivables we also retained approximately 140 million of workers’ compensation liabilities for claims incurred by kraft foods group employees prior to the spinoff in november 2012 we paid kraft foods group 95 million to cash settle the net trade payables and receivables as of december 31 2012 we also have a 55 million receivable from kraft foods group related to the cash settlement of stock awards held by our respective employees at the time of the spinoff as further described in note 11 stock plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

our results from continuing operations include onetime spinoff transaction transition and financing and related costs “spinoff costs” we have incurred to date we recorded spinoff costs of 1053 million or 039 per diluted share in 2012 and 46 million or 002 per diluted share in 2011 we expect to incur spinoff costs of approximately 100 million in 2013 related primarily to human resource customer service and logistics and information systems and processes as well as legal costs associated with revising intellectual property and other longterm agreements 

refer to note 2 divestitures and acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the spinoff of kraft foods group  

cadbury acquisition 

in 2010 we acquired all the outstanding shares of cadbury limited “cadbury” in an acquisition valued at 18547 million or 17503 million net of cash and cash equivalents in 2010 we incurred acquisitionrelated transaction costs of 218 million recorded in selling general and administrative expense and acquisitionrelated financing fees of 96 million recorded in interest and other expenses net 

as a condition of the acquisition the eu commission required that we divest certain cadbury confectionery operations in poland and romania the divestitures were completed in the third quarter of 2010 and generated 342 million of sale proceeds the impact of these divestitures was reflected as adjustments within the cadbury final purchase accounting 

during 2010 cadbury contributed net revenues of 9143 million and net earnings of 530 million from february 2 2010 through december 31 2010 see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the cadbury acquisition 

customers 

as a percentage of our net revenues from continuing operations our five largest customers accounted for 156 of net revenues in 2012 compared with 155 in 2011 and 151 in 2010 also our ten largest customers accounted for 241 of net revenues in 2012 compared with 227 in 2011 and 232 in 2010 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations 

seasonality 

demand for some of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events however overall sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our products within our diversified product portfolio 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to currency exchange rates we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price moreover improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial research development advertising and promotional expenditures 

  

distribution and marketing 

across our segments our products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets we distribute our products through direct store delivery companyowned and satellite warehouses distribution centers and other facilities we also use the services of independent sales offices and agents in some of our international locations 

our marketing efforts are conducted through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing in onair print outdoor digital and social media ii consumer incentives such as coupons and contests and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including sugar and other sweeteners coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils and dairy in addition we use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we regularly monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can costeffectively secure ingredients and packaging required for production 

significant cost items in biscuit chocolate gum  candy and many powdered beverage products are sugar and cocoa we purchase sugar and cocoa on world markets and the prices of these commodities are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in foreign currencies significant cost items in our biscuit products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced volatility and have increased significantly in recent years due largely to burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel and other factors such as weather the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which we purchase on world markets as well as from local grower cooperatives green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products significant cost items in packaging include cardboards resins and plastics and our energy costs include natural gas electricity and diesel fuel we purchase these packaging and energy commodities on world markets and within the countries we operate and the prices are affected by supply and changes in foreign currencies 

during 2012 our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of increased packaging energy grains and oil costs we expect the price volatility and a slightly higher cost environment to continue over the remainder of 2013 we have addressed higher commodity costs primarily through higher pricing lower manufacturing costs due to our endtoend cost management program and overhead cost control we expect to continue to use these measures to address further commodity cost increases 

external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the prices for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs while the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property rights including trademarks patents copyright registered designs proprietary trade secrets technology and knowhow are material to our business 

we own numerous trademarks and patents in countries around the world depending upon the country trademarks remain valid for as long as they are in use or their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms we have patents for a number of current and potential products our patents cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in connection with the manufacture sale or distribution of third party products similarly we sell some products under brands we license from third parties in our agreement with the kraft foods group we each granted the other party various licenses to use certain of our and their respective intellectual property rights in named jurisdictions following the spinoff 

  

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs at december 31 2012 we had approximately 2700 food scientists chemists and engineers working primarily in 12 key technology centers east hanover new jersey whippany new jersey banbury united kingdom bournville united kingdom curitiba brazil eysins switzerland paris france melbourne australia mexico city mexico munich germany reading united kingdom and suzhou china many of our technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and stateoftheart instruments our research and development expense was 462 million in 2012 511 million in 2011 and 404 million in 2010 

regulation 

our food products and packaging materials are subject to local national and multinational regulations comprising labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising privacy and related areas in addition various jurisdictions regulate our operations by licensing our manufacturing plants enforcing standards for selected food products grading food products inspecting manufacturing plants and warehouses regulating trade practices related to the sale of and imposing their own labeling requirements on our food products many of the food commodities we use in our operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic governmental and administrative review 

throughout the countries in which we do business regulators are continually adopting new laws and implementing new regulations that affect our business and operations such as the european commission’s eu health claim regulation effective december 14 2012 that limits the number of health claims that may be made by food companies about their products and a major reform of the eu legal framework related to the protection of personal data and in the us the food safety modernization act that provides additional food safety authority to the fda we will continue to monitor developments of those new laws and regulations at this time we do not expect the cost of complying with these new laws and implementing these new regulations will be material 

environmental regulation 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party as of december 31 2012 our subsidiaries were involved in one active proceeding in the us under a state equivalent of cercla related to our current operations as of december 31 2011 our subsidiaries were involved in 68 active actions except for the one active proceeding we retained all the remaining active actions relate to and were retained by the divested kraft foods group business 

as of december 31 2012 we accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

  

employees 

at december 31 2012 we employed approximately 110000 people worldwide our business units are subject to various local national and multinational laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees in accordance with european union requirements we also have established a european workers council composed of management and elected members of our workforce employees represented by labor unions or workers’ councils represent 377 of our 96000 employees outside the us and 231 of our 14000 us employees most of these workers are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years we believe we have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations 

foreign operations 

we sell our products to consumers in approximately 165 countries at december 31 2012 we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 171 manufacturing and processing facilities in 56 countries we generated 829 of our 2012 net revenues 837 of our 2011 net revenues and 826 of our 2010 net revenues from continuing operations outside the us refer to note 16 segment reporting for additional information on our foreign operations also for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations see “risk factors” in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food and snacking industries are highly competitive our principal competitors are major international food snack and beverage companies that like us operate in multiple geographic areas we compete based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures additionally the emergence of new distribution channels such as internet sales directly to consumers may affect customer and consumer preferences competition and customer pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we reduce prices or our costs increase but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

  

maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with worldwide recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands into new geographies and to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food and snacking marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain extend and expand our brand image as the media and communications environment continues to evolve negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the consolidation of retail customers creates larger retailers with increased influence in the marketplace 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the european union the united states and our other major markets continue to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business consolidation also produces large more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands further retail consolidation and increasing retail power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could affect sales and our ability to supply products to our customers 

during 2012 our five largest customers accounted for 156 of our net revenues no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our net revenues from continuing operations there can be no assurance that all significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disputes with significant suppliers including those related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including sugar and other sweeteners coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils and dairy in addition we use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products we also use natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses prices for commodities other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global 

  

competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the price of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes while decreases could require us to lower our prices and affect our revenues profits or margins if we are not successful in our hedging activities if we are unable to price to cover increased costs or if we must reduce our prices then commodity and other input price volatility increases or decreases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we must leverage our value proposition in order to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

retailers are increasingly offering retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as those we continue to experience consumers may not buy our products if the difference in value or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands narrows or if consumers perceive a narrowing if consumers switch to purchasing or otherwise prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings the impact could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations could increase our costs 

our activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food production and marketing as well as licensing trade tax and environmental matters governing bodies regularly adopt new laws and regulations and change existing laws and regulations our need to comply with new or revised laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 

we are a large food and snacking company operating in highly regulated environments and constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks around the world consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover our failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we may decide or be required to recall products or be subjected to other product liability claims 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent risks we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering any of these events could materially and adversely affect our reputation and product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a widespread product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate globally 

we are a global company generating 829 of our 2012 net revenues 837 of our 2011 net revenues and 826 of our 2010 net revenues outside the united states with operations in more than 80 countries our operations are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 

           in addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain emerging markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in emerging markets including brazil china india mexico russia and southeast asia however some emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than most established markets in many countries outside of the united states particularly in those with emerging economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations with extraterritorial reach such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in emerging markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand their production capacities our success in emerging markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in emerging markets our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

unanticipated business disruptions could affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we manufacture and source products and materials on a global scale we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability consistently to provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters fire terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations for example by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or cannot quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers’ confidence and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

  

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

we must distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base including by geography we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example recently consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sodium consumption we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may be unsuccessful in these efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully identify or complete acquisitions or divestitures or successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including the expected increases in revenues and operating results any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial results in addition we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

the spinoff increased the proportion of our business exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are now more sensitive to movements in exchange rates than in prior periods because a larger portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for external reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollardenominated indebtedness and dividends in addition movements in foreign exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations but our efforts may not be successful accordingly a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar or changes in the relative value of any two currencies that we use for transactions could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are increasingly dependent on information technology 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers around the world these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers or suppliers in addition the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid global capital markets and volatile global economic conditions could limit our access to the capital markets reduce our liquidity and increase our borrowing costs 

from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm global capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our short and longterm credit ratings the liquidity of the overall global capital markets and the state of the global economy including the food industry will affect our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the global capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we access the us and euro commercial paper markets for regular funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the global commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the global credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and could raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

our inability to access the global capital markets or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets interest rates or other factors could substantially increase our pension costs 

we sponsor a number of benefit plans for our employees throughout the world including defined benefit pension plans retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits at the end of 2012 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 112 billion and plan assets were 83 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate arrangements made with the trustees of certain plans and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation 

based on current tax laws we estimate our 2013 pension contributions will be approximately 320 million we also expect that our net pension cost will decrease to approximately 370 million in 2013 the decrease is primarily due to nonrecurring costs in 2012 related primarily to certain pension plan obligations transferred to kraft foods group in the spinoff and other 2012 onetime costs partially offset by increased pension plan expenses in 2013 related to lower discount rates volatility in the global capital markets has increased the risk that we may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2013 a significant portion of some of our pension trust assets are invested in european sovereign debt and are subject to heightened risk that they will lose value as a result of political and financial turmoil in europe 

  

due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans we may have exposure under those plans that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees if a participating employer ceases its contributions to the plan as a result of a bankruptcy or otherwise such as in the case of hostess brands’ bankruptcy which we are currently evaluating we may be required to participate in funding the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to the withdrawing employer and our costs might increase as a result see note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information further if we withdraw from a multiemployer pension plan we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on our allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan 

a significant increase in our pension funding requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in the business 

we may be unable to hire or retain and develop key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce 

our continued growth requires us to hire retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse global workforce we compete to hire new personnel and then to develop and retain their skills and competencies any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan to backfill current leadership positions or to hire and retain a diverse global workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage in addition our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business 

we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert management’s and other key personnel’s attention from our business operations third party claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we routinely are involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations “legal matters” arising in the ordinary course of our business 

competition authorities in certain member states of the european union have ongoing investigations into possible anticompetitive activity in the fast moving consumer goods “fmcg” sector which includes products such as chocolate and coffee on january 31 2012 the german federal cartel office “fco” issued a press release stating that it had discontinued proceedings against our wholly owned subsidiary kraft foods deutschland gmbh “kfd” based on a settlement agreed between kfd and the fco following the fco’s finding of an exchange of competitively sensitive information the fco also imposed fines against a former kfd employee as well as several other producers of confectionery due to kfd’s cooperation with the fco in the matter the fine to resolve the matter against kfd was reduced to € 217 million 

a compliant and ethical corporate culture which includes adhering to laws and industry regulations in all jurisdictions in which we do business is integral to our success accordingly after we acquired cadbury in february 2010 we began reviewing and adjusting as needed cadbury’s operations in light of applicable standards as well as our policies and practices we initially focused on such high priority areas as food safety the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and antitrust based upon cadbury’s preacquisition policies and compliance programs and our postacquisition reviews our preliminary findings indicated that cadbury’s overall state of compliance was sound nonetheless through our reviews we determined that in certain jurisdictions including india there appeared to be facts and circumstances warranting further investigation we are continuing our investigations in certain jurisdictions including in india and we continue to cooperate with governmental authorities 

as we previously disclosed on february 1 2011 we received a subpoena from the sec in connection with an investigation under the fcpa primarily related to a facility in india that we acquired in the cadbury acquisition the subpoena primarily requests information regarding dealings with indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals related to the operation of that facility we are cooperating with the us and indian governments in their investigations of these matters 

as we previously disclosed on march 1 2011 the starbucks coffee company “starbucks” took control of the starbucks packaged coffee business “starbucks cpg business” in grocery stores and other channels starbucks did so without our authorization and in what we contend is a violation and breach of our license and supply agreement with starbucks related to the starbucks cpg business the dispute is in arbitration in chicago illinois we are seeking appropriate remedies including payment of the fair market value of the supply and license agreement plus the premium this agreement specifies prejudgment interest under new york law and attorney’s fees starbucks has counterclaimed for damages testimony and posthearing briefing in the arbitration proceeding are completed we await the arbitrator’s decision kraft foods group remains the named party in the proceeding under the separation and distribution agreement between kraft foods group and us kraft foods group will direct any recovery awarded in the arbitration proceeding to us we will reimburse kraft foods group for any costs and expenses it incurs in connection with the arbitration 

while we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal matters in which we are currently involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of these legal matters individually or in the aggregate will have a material effect on our financial results

in order to implement the spinoff we entered into certain agreements with kraft foods group to effect our legal and structural separation govern the relationship between us and allocate various assets liabilities and obligations between us including among other things employee benefits intellectual property and taxrelated assets and liabilities see note 14 income taxes  for additional information on the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities transferred or retained in the spinoff in addition to executing the spinoff in the manner provided in the agreements in november 2012 pursuant to these agreements we paid kraft foods group 163 million related to targeted cash flows together with the 247 million of cash divested on the distribution date totaling 410 million of cash transferred to kraft foods group in connection with the spinoff to facilitate the management including final payment and resolution of certain obligations kraft foods group retained certain of our north american net trade payables and receivables we also retained approximately 140 million of workers’ compensation liabilities for claims incurred by kraft foods group employees prior to the spinoff in november 2012 we paid kraft foods group 95 million to cash settle the net trade payables and receivables and which are also reflected in table above as of december 31 2012 we also have a 55 million receivable from kraft foods group related to the cash settlement of stock awards held by our respective employees at the time of the spinoff as further described in note 11 stock plans  to the consolidated financial statements 

our results from continuing operations include onetime spinoff transaction transition and financing and related costs “spinoff costs” we have incurred to date we recorded spinoff costs of 1053 million or 039 per diluted share in 2012 and 46 million or 002 per diluted share in 2011 we expect to incur spinoff costs of approximately 100 million in 2013 related primarily to human resource customer service and logistics and information systems and processes as well as legal costs associated with revising intellectual property and other longterm agreements 

cadbury acquisition 

in 2010 we acquired all the outstanding shares of cadbury limited “cadbury” in an acquisition valued at 18547 million or 17503 million net of cash and cash equivalents in 2010 we incurred acquisitionrelated transaction costs of 218 million recorded in selling general and administrative expense and acquisitionrelated financing fees of 96 million recorded in interest and other expenses net 

  

as a condition to granting approval of the acquisition the eu required that we divest certain cadbury confectionery operations in poland and romania the divestitures were completed in the third quarter of 2010 and generated 342 million of sale proceeds the impact of these divestitures was reflected as adjustments within the cadbury final purchase accounting 

during 2010 cadbury contributed net revenues of 9143 million and net earnings of 530 million from february 2 2010 through december 31 2010 the following unaudited pro forma summary presents our consolidated results of continuing operations as if cadbury had been acquired on january 1 2010 these amounts were calculated after conversion to us gaap applying our accounting policies and adjusting cadbury’s results to reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied from january 1 2010 together with the consequential tax effects these adjustments also reflect the additional interest expense incurred on the debt to finance the purchase and the divestitures of certain cadbury confectionery operations in poland and romania 

 



we also acquired assets and assumed liabilities as follows in millions 

 



 

    other divestitures and sales of property 

during the three months ended december 31 2012 we completed several divestitures within our europe segment which generated cash proceeds of 200 million and pretax gains of 107 million the divestitures primarily included a dinners and sauces grocery business in germany and belgium and a canned meat business in italy in 2011 there were no significant divestitures in 2010 as discussed above we divested businesses in poland and romania in connection with the acquisition of cadbury 

during the three months ended march 31 2012 we also sold property located in russia which generated cash proceeds of 72 million and a pretax gain of 55 million which was recorded within selling general and administrative expenses 

the aggregate operating results of the divestitures discussed above were not material to our financial statements in any of the periods presented 

  

20122014 restructuring program 

on march 14 2012 our board of directors approved 11 billion of restructuring and related implementation costs “20122014 restructuring program” reflecting primarily severance asset disposals and other manufacturingrelated onetime costs the primary objective of the restructuring and implementation activities was to ensure that both kraft foods group and mondelēz international were each set up to operate efficiently and execute on our respective business strategies upon separation and in the future on october 23 2012 our board of directors approved 400 million of additional restructuring and related implementation programs totaling 15 billion of expected 20122014 restructuring program costs 

of the 15 billion of 20122014 restructuring program costs 575 million relates to kraft foods group and approximately 925 million are costs we expect to incur or have incurred in our results from continuing operations 

through december 31 2012 we have recorded restructuring charges of 102 million or 004 per diluted share in our results from continuing operations which were recorded within asset impairment and exit costs in 2012 we spent 33 million on primarily severance and related costs and also recognized noncash severance and related costs and asset writedowns including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments totaling 33 million at december 31 2012 36 million of restructuring liabilities were recorded within other current liabilities in 2012 we also incurred 8 million of implementation costs which were recorded within cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses see note 6 20122014 restructuring program  for additional information 

integration program 

as a result of our combination with cadbury in 2010 we launched an integration program to realize annual cost savings of approximately 750 million by the end of 2013 and revenue synergies from investments in distribution marketing and product development in order to achieve these cost savings and synergies and integrate the two businesses we expect to incur total integration charges of approximately 15 billion through the end of 2013 the “integration program” 

integration program costs include the costs associated with combining the cadbury operations within our global snacks business and are separate from the costs related to the acquisition since the inception of the integration program we have incurred approximately 13 billion of the estimated 15 billion total integration charges in 2012 we met and exceeded our annual cost savings target of 750 million and achieved approximately 800 million of annual costs savings one year ahead of schedule 

we recorded integration program charges of 185 million in 2012 521 million in 2011 and 646 million in 2010 during 2012 we reversed 45 million of integration program charges previously accrued in 2010 and primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur within our europe segment we recorded these charges in operations as a part of selling general and administrative expenses primarily within our europe and developing markets segments as well as within general corporate expenses at december 31 2012 we had an accrual of 202 million related to the integration program see note 7 integration program and cost savings initiatives  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

cost savings initiatives 

cost savings initiatives generally include exit disposal and other project costs outside of our integration program and 20122014 restructuring program and consist of the following specific initiatives 

     

accounting calendar changes in 2011 and 2010 

the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last saturday of the year a portion of our international operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day of the year in 2011 the last saturday of the year fell on december 31 so our 2011 results included one more week of operating results “53 rd week” than 2012 or 2010 which each had 52 weeks 

in 2011 we changed the consolidation date for certain operations of our europe segment and in the latin america central and eastern europe “cee” and middle east and africa “mea” regions within our developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period subsequent to the 2011 changes our europe segment reports results as of the last saturday of each period certain operations within our developing markets segment report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last saturday of the period these changes and the 53 rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of 679 million and a favorable impact of 93 million to operating income in 2011 

in 2010 we changed the consolidation date for certain european biscuits operations which are included within our europe segment and certain operations in asia pacific and latin america within our developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported periodend results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period europe moved the reporting of these operations to two weeks prior to the end of the period and asia pacific and latin america moved the reporting of these operations to the last day of the period these changes resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of 193 million and a favorable impact of 23 million to operating income in 2010 

we believe these changes are preferable and will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our europe segment and developing markets segment and by bringing the reporting date closer to the periodend date as the effect to priorperiod results was not material we have not revised priorperiod results 

provision for income taxes 

our 2012 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the mix of pretax income in various foreign jurisdictions and net tax benefits of 101 million from discrete onetime events primarily related to the revaluation of uk deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2012 that reduced uk corporate income tax rates and net favorable tax audit settlements partially offset by nondeductible expenses 

our 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the mix of pretax income in various foreign jurisdictions and net tax benefits of 226 million from discrete onetime events primarily from the revaluation of uk deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted in 2011 that reduced uk corporate income tax rates the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets that are now expected to be realized and the net favorable impact from various us federal and foreign tax audit developments during the year 

our 2010 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the mix of pretax income in various foreign jurisdictions and net tax benefits of 165 million from discrete onetime events primarily from the favorable resolution of us federal and foreign tax audits and the revaluation of uk deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted in 2010 that reduced uk corporate income tax rates partially offset by a writeoff of deferred tax assets as a result of the us health care legislation enacted in march 2010 

  

consolidated results of operations 

the following discussion compares our consolidated results of operations for 2012 with 2011 and 2011 with 2010 

2012 compared with 2011 

 



net revenues – net revenues decreased 795 million 22 to 35015 million in 2012 and organic net revenues 1 increased 1531 million 44 to 36347 million as follows 

 



 

 organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volumemix higher net pricing including the impact of pricing actions from the prior year was realized across all reportable segments as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs favorable volumemix was driven by higher shipments in developing markets and europe mostly offset by lower shipments in north america driven primarily by the completion of a comanufacturing agreement from a previous divestiture unfavorable foreign currency decreased net revenues by 1576 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies primarily the euro brazilian real indian rupee argentinean peso south african rand russian ruble and mexican peso nonrecurring accounting calendar changes in 2011 resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 679 million divested businesses also resulted in a yearoveryear decrease in net revenues of 72 million 

  

operating income – operating income increased 139 million 40 to 3637 million in 2012 adjusted operating income 1 increased 138 million 34 to 4235 million and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis 1 increased 291 million 71 to 4388 million due to the following 



 

  higher net pricing including the impact of pricing actions taken in the prior year outpaced increased input costs during 2012 the increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs partially offset by lower manufacturing costs favorable volumemix was driven by strong contributions from developing markets and europe partially offset by an unfavorable impact in north america total selling general and administrative expenses decreased 206 million from 2011 including the benefits from a favorable impact of foreign currency on expenses lower integration program costs including the reversal of previously accrued integration program charges primarily related to planned and announced position eliminations that did not occur higher expenses in the prior year related to accounting calendar changes divested businesses and a gain on the sale of a property in russia which were partially offset by the spinoff costs and 20122014 restructuring program costs incurred in 2012 excluding these factors selling general and administrative expenses increased 293 million from 2011 driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in each of the geographic units partially offset by the reversal of reserves not required carried over from the cadbury acquisition in 2010 unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by 153 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar relative to most foreign currencies primarily the euro brazilian real argentinean peso and indian rupee partially offset by the impact of adjustments in the prior year related to the highly inflationary venezuelan economy accounting calendar changes made in 2011 including the 53 rd week of shipments in 2011 decreased operating income by 93 million in 2012 we divested property located in russia and recorded a pretax gain of 55 million during 2012 we recorded 52 million related to a trademark impairment in japan the change in unrealized gains  losses on hedging activities increased operating income by 37 million as we recognized gains of 1 million in 2012 versus losses of 36 million in 2011 

as a result of the net effect of these drivers operating income margin increased from 98 in 2011 to 104 in 2012 the margin increase was due primarily to higher gross margin reflecting the impact of pricing actions net of increased input costs and the favorable change in unrealized gains on hedging activities and overhead leverage partially offset by the impact of higher advertising and consumer promotion costs the favorable impacts from lower integration program costs and the realized net gain on divestitures were offset by the unfavorable impacts of higher spinoff costs and the 20122014 restructuring program costs 

  

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international – net earnings attributable to mondelēz international of 3028 million decreased by 499 million 141 in 2012 diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international was 169 in 2012 down 151 from 199 in 2011 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to mondelēz international was 086 in 2012 down 113 from 097 in 2011 operating eps 1 was 139 in 2012 up 001 07 from 138 in 2011 operating eps on a constant currency basis 1 was 145 in 2012 up 007 51 from 138 in 2011 these changes shown net of tax below were due to the following 

 



 

       

2011 compared with 2010 

 



net revenues – net revenues increased 4321 million 137 to 35810 million in 2011 and organic net revenues 1 increased 2193 million 70 to 33385 million as follows 

 



 

  organic net revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volumemix higher net pricing was realized across all reportable segments as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs favorable volumemix was driven primarily by higher shipments in developing markets favorable foreign currency increased net revenues by 1074 million due primarily to the strength of most foreign currencies relative to the us dollar primarily the euro australian dollar brazilian real swedish krona british pound swiss franc canadian dollar and russian ruble the cadbury acquisition due to the incremental january 2011 operating results added 697 million in net revenues in 2011 accounting calendar changes including the 53 rd week of shipments in 2011 and excluding the effects of foreign currency added 655 million in net revenues in 2011 as compared to 193 million in 2010 these gains were partially offset by the impact of divestitures 

  

operating income – operating income increased 1002 million 401 to 3498 million in 2011 and adjusted operating income 1 increased 654 million 187 to 4156 million and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis 1 increased 495 million 141 to 3997 million due to the following 



 

   higher pricing outpaced increased input costs during 2011 the increase in input costs was driven by significantly higher raw material costs as well as higher manufacturing costs favorable volumemix was driven by a strong contribution from developing markets partially offset by an unfavorable impact in north america total selling general and administrative expenses increased 242 million from 2010 including the detriments from an unfavorable impact of foreign currency on expenses the incremental expenses associated with our cadbury acquisition and 2011 accounting calendar changes partially offset by lower integration program costs and lower expenses related to divested businesses excluding these factors selling general and administrative expenses increased 71 million from 2010 driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs in developing markets favorable foreign currency increased operating income by 159 million due primarily to the strength of most foreign currencies relative to us dollar primarily the euro australian dollar and brazilian real the cadbury acquisition due to the incremental january 2011 operating results increased operating income by 83 million the change in unrealized gainslosses on hedging activities decreased operating income by 74 million as we recognized losses of 36 million in 2011 versus gains of 38 million in 2010 accounting calendar changes including the 53 rd week of shipments in 2011 and excluding the effects of foreign currency added 66 million in operating income as we realized operating income from accounting calendar changes of 89 million in 2011 versus 23 million in 2010 during 2011 we reversed 5 million in restructuring program charges recorded in prior years versus a reversal of 29 million in restructuring program charges recorded in prior years during 2010 we recorded asset impairment charges of 55 million in 2010 related to intangible assets in china and the netherlands and on a biscuit plant and related property plant and equipment in france 

as a result of the net effect of these drivers operating income margin increased from 79 in 2010 to 98 in 2011 the margin increase was due primarily to overhead leverage lower acquisitionrelated costs and lower integration program costs which more than offset a decline in gross profit margin driven primarily by the impact of the higher revenue base on the margin calculation 

  

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to mondelēz international – net earnings attributable to mondelēz international of 3527 million decreased by 587 million 143 in 2011 diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international was 199 in 2011 down 167 from 239 in 2010 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to mondelēz international was 097 in 2011 up 1553 from 038 in 2010 operating eps 1 was 141 in 2011 up 035 330 from 106 in 2010 operating eps on a constant currency basis 1 was 134 in 2012 up 028 264 from 106 in 2011 these changes shown net of tax below were due to the following

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include mondelēz international as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last saturday of the year a portion of our international operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day in 2011 the last saturday of the year fell on december 31 so our 2011 results included one more week of operating results “53 rd week” than 2012 or 2010 which each had 52 weeks 

in 2011 we changed the consolidation date for certain operations of our europe segment and in the latin america central and eastern europe “cee” and middle east and africa “mea” regions within our developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period subsequent to the 2011 changes our europe segment reports results as of the last saturday of each period certain operations within our developing markets segment now report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last saturday of the period these changes and the 53 rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of 679 million and a favorable impact of 93 million to operating income in 2011 

in 2010 we changed the consolidation date for certain european biscuits operations which are included within our europe segment and certain operations in asia pacific and latin america within our developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported periodend results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period europe moved the reporting of these operations to two weeks prior to the end of the period and asia pacific and latin america moved the reporting of these operations to the last day of the period these changes resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of 193 million and a favorable impact of 23 million to operating income in 2010 

we believe these changes are preferable and will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our europe and developing markets segments and by bringing the reporting dates closer to the periodend date as the effect to priorperiod results was not material we have not revised priorperiod results 

we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence 2050 ownership interest under the equity method of accounting we use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20 and in which we do not exercise significant influence noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of mondelēz international all intercompany transactions are eliminated 

use of estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions include among others pension and benefit plan assumptions valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets useful lives of longlived assets marketing program accruals insurance and selfinsurance reserves and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which we know the actual amounts historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market we value all our inventories using the average cost method we also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes 

  

longlived assets 

we review longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of assets held for use we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

in 2012 we recorded impairment charges of 18 million within the 20122014 restructuring program we did not record any asset impairments in 2011 in 2010 we recorded an impairment of 12 million for certain property plant and equipment in a biscuit plant in france 

goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets 

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually on october 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk by first performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors for each reporting unit if significant potential goodwill impairment risk exists for a specific reporting unit we apply a twostep quantitative test the first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a 20year projection of discounted cash flows which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value for reporting units within our north america and europe geographic units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 63 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for reporting units within our developing markets geographic unit we used a riskrated discount rate of 93 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans industry and economic conditions our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value 

in 2012 2011 and 2010 there were no impairments of goodwill in connection with our 2012 annual impairment testing we noted two reporting units which were more sensitive to nearterm changes in discounted cash flow assumptions us confections with 2177 million of goodwill as of december 31 2012 and fair value in excess of its carrying value of net assets of 9 and europe biscuits with 2569 million of goodwill as of december 31 2012 and fair value in excess of its carrying value of net assets of 16 while the reporting units passed the first step of the impairment test if the segment operating income or another valuation assumption for either reporting unit were to deteriorate significantly in the future it could adversely affect the estimated fair value if we are unsuccessful in our plans to increase the profitability of these businesses the estimated fair values could fall further and lead to a potential goodwill impairment in the future 

we test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by first performing a qualitative review by assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific nonamortizable intangible asset we quantitatively test for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets is determined using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to its estimated fair value we record intangible asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs 

during our 2012 review of nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded 52 million of charges related to a trademark on a japanese chewing gum product within our developing markets segment which had significantly lower revenue the fair value of the intangible asset was determined under a relief of royalty valuation which models the cash flows from the trademark assuming royalties were received under a licensing arrangement the charge was calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset over its estimated fair value and was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs during our 2011 review there were no impairments of nonamortizable intangible assets during our 2010 review we recorded a 13 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands and a 30 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in china 

insurance and selfinsurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation general liability automobile liability product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits we estimate the liabilities associated with these risks by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results 

  

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers our shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales provisions for product returns and customer allowances are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized 

marketing and research and development 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred advertising expense was 1815 million in 2012 1860 million in 2011 and 1729 million in 2010 we expense product research and development costs as incurred research and development expense was 462 million in 2012 511 million in 2011 and 404 million in 2010 we record marketing and research and development expenses within selling general and administrative expenses 

environmental costs 

throughout the countries in which we do business we are subject to local national and multinational environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

in the united states the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” cercla imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party as of december 31 2012 our subsidiaries were involved in one active proceeding in the us under a state equivalent of cercla related to our current operations as of december 31 2011 our subsidiaries were involved in 68 active actions except for the one active proceeding we retained all the remaining active actions relate to and were retained by the divested kraft foods group business 

as of december 31 2012 we accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

employee benefit plans 

we provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees depending on jurisdictions tenure presence of a union job level and other factors these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits consisting primarily of severance we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries refer to note 10 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 

in connection with the spinoff we transferred to kraft foods group the plan liabilities and assets associated with the kraft foods group active and retired employees and certain of our retired employees that previously participated in our north american benefit plans at october 1 2012 we transferred benefit plan liabilities of 12218 million pension plan assets of 6550 million accumulated other comprehensive losses net of tax of 3810 million and 2146 million of related deferred tax assets we also expect annual pension expenses to decrease by 91 million in connection with certain of our north american benefit plan obligations which were transferred to kraft foods group in the spinoff 

  

we recorded the following amounts in earnings from continuing operations for these employee benefit plans during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 



the 2012 net expense for employee benefit plans of 607 million increased by 89 million over the 2011 amount primarily related to higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences related to the us and nonus pension plans the 2011 net expense for employee benefit plans of 518 million increased by 59 million over the 2010 amount primarily related to higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences related to the us pension plans and the incorporation of a canadian postemployment plan into our obligations 

we expect our 2013 net expense for employee benefit plans to decrease by approximately 66 million the decrease is primarily due to nonrecurring costs in 2012 related primarily to certain benefit plan obligations transferred to kraft foods group in the spinoff and other 2012 onetime costs partially offset by increased benefit plan expenses in 2013 due to lower discount rates 

in 2012 other comprehensive losses included 2266 million of net actuarial pretax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2012 65 basis point decrease for us plans and 81 basis point decrease for nonus plans and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2012 50 basis point decrease for us plans and 21 basis point decrease for our nonus plans in 2011 other comprehensive losses included 2333 million of net actuarial pretax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2011 68 basis point decrease for us plans and 49 basis point decrease for nonus plans unfavorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2011 60 basis point decrease for us plans and 73 basis point decrease for our nonus plans in 2010 other comprehensive earnings included 361 million of net actuarial pretax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2010 40 basis point decrease for us plans and 10 basis point decrease for nonus plans and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2010 40 basis point decrease for us plans and 23 basis point decrease for our nonus plans partially offset by favorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets 

in 2012 we contributed 349 million to our us pension plans including 202 million related to kraft foods group us pension plans and 329 million to our nonus pension plans including 42 million related to kraft foods group nonus pension plans in addition employees contributed 24 million to our nonus plans of our 2012 pension contributions 315 million was voluntary including 185 million related to kraft foods group pension plans we make contributions to our us and nonus pension plans primarily to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability 

in 2013 we estimate that our pension contributions will be 8 million to our us plans and 309 million to our nonus plans based on current tax laws we are currently only required to make a nominal cash contribution to our us qualified pension plans under the pension protection act of 2006 of the total 2013 pension contributions none is expected to be voluntary our actual contributions may be different due to many factors including changes in tax and other benefit laws significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates or other factors 

for salaried and nonunion hourly employees hired in the us after january 1 2009 we discontinued benefits under our us pension plans and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan additionally we will be freezing the us pension plans for current salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective december 31 2019 

  

for our postretirement plans our 2013 health care cost trend rate assumption increased to 750 from 700 for our us postretirement plans and increased to 768 from 742 for our nonus postretirement plans we established these rates based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 500 for us plans by 2018 and 558 for nonus plans by 2018 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on our costs and obligation as of december 31 2012 

 



our 2013 discount rate assumption decreased to 420 from 470 for our us postretirement plans and decreased to 408 from 429 for our nonus postretirement plans our 2013 discount rate decreased to 420 from 485 for our us pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations our 2013 discount rate assumption for our nonus pension plans decreased to 381 from 462 we developed the discount rates for our nonus plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2013 expected rate of return on plan assets decreased to 775 from 800 for our us pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments our 2013 expected rate of return on plan assets decreased to 608 from 647 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2013 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease in cost as of december 31 2012 

 



financial instruments 

we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results a principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates principally through the use of derivative instruments 

we use a combination of primarily foreign currency forward contracts futures options and swaps commodity forward contracts futures and options and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 9 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use 

  

we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets or other current liabilities due to their relatively shortterm duration cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge to the extent that the hedge is effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the related hedged asset or liability are recorded in earnings in the same period we use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates with changes in the value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses 

in order to qualify for hedge accounting a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period we must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for a hedge of a forecasted transaction the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur if it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings 

when we use derivatives we are exposed to credit and market risks credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments 

income taxes 

we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when uncertain tax positions are assessed more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

contingencies 

see note 12 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 

  

commodity trends 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including sugar and other sweeteners coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils and dairy in addition we use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses we regularly monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

significant cost items in biscuit chocolate gum  candy and many powdered beverage products are sugar and cocoa we purchase sugar and cocoa on world markets and the prices of these commodities are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in foreign currencies significant cost items in our biscuit products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced volatility and have increased significantly in recent years due largely to burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel and other factors such as weather the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which we purchase on world markets as well as from local grower cooperatives green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products significant cost items in packaging include cardboards resins and plastics and our energy costs include natural gas electricity and diesel fuel we purchase these packaging and energy commodities on world markets and within the countries we operate and the prices are affected by supply and changes in foreign currencies 

during 2012 our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of increased packaging energy grains and oil costs we expect the price volatility and a slightly higher cost environment to continue over the remainder of 2013 we have addressed higher commodity costs primarily through higher pricing lower manufacturing costs due to our endtoend cost management program and overhead cost control we expect to continue to use these measures to address further commodity cost increases 

external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the prices for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs while the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our cash from operations our existing 45 billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper program and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt we continue to utilize our commercial paper program and primarily uncommitted international credit lines for regular funding requirements we also use intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity including the permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 3923 million in 2012 4520 million in 2011 and 3748 million in 2010 the decrease in operating cash flows in 2012 was primarily related to higher spending associated with spinoff costs and the 20122014 restructuring program partially offset by lower net working capital costs primarily related to favorable inventory positions due to higher inventory costs in 2011 and favorable accounts payable positions partially offset by increased receivables the increase in operating cash flows in 2011 is primarily related to increased earnings and the absence of tax payments in the prior year in connection with kraft foods group’s frozen pizza divestiture partially offset by higher working capital mainly higher inventory costs increased interest payments and increased integration program spending and a 495 million voluntary contribution to our us pension plans 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1687 million in 2012 1728 million in 2011 and 7462 million in 2010 the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in 2012 related to proceeds received from our divested businesses and lower capital expenditures in the current year partially offset by cash transferred to kraft foods group related to the spinoff the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 primarily related to cash payments in 2010 related to the 2010 cadbury acquisition partially offset by the proceeds from kraft foods group’s sale of the frozen pizza business and proceeds we received from the divestitures in poland and romania related to our acquisition of cadbury 

capital expenditures which were funded by operating activities and include expenditures for kraft foods group in all periods through october 1 2012 were 1610 million in 2012 1771 million in 2011 and 1661 million in 2010 the 2012 capital expenditures were made primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately 2 billion including capital expenditures required for investments in systems the 20122014 restructuring program and the integration program we expect to continue to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash provided by  used in financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 204 million in 2012 3175 million used in 2011 and 4188 million provided in 2010 the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2012 was primarily due to higher proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt including notes issued by kraft foods group in june 2012 for which we retained the proceeds offset by higher longterm debt repayments the net cash used in 2011 primarily related to 2043 million in dividends paid 1114 million in longterm debt repayments and 565 million in repayments of shortterm borrowings partially offset by 492 million in primarily proceeds from stock option exercises the net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 primarily related to proceeds from our longterm debt issuance of 9433 million partially offset by 2175 million in dividends paid 2134 million in longterm debt repayments primarily related to our repurchase of 15 billion in notes through our tender offer and 864 million in net repayments of shortterm borrowings 

borrowing arrangements 

we maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes including for working capital purposes and to support our commercial paper issuances our 45 billion fouryear senior unsecured revolving credit facility expires in april 2015 as of december 31 2012 no amounts have been drawn on the facility 

the revolving credit agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses of at least 286 billion at december 31 2012 our shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses was 348 billion we expect to continue to meet this covenant the revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations covenants and events of default however the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security 

some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet shortterm working capital needs collectively these credit lines amounted to 24 billion at december 31 2012 and 23 billion at december 31 2011 in the aggregate borrowings on these lines amounted to 274 million at december 31 2012 and 182 million at december 31 2011 

  

longterm debt 

our total debt was 194 billion at december 31 2012 and 269 billion at december 31 2011 our debttocapitalization ratio was 038 at december 31 2012 and 043 at december 31 2011 at december 31 2012 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 88 years

        on june 4 2012 kraft foods group issued 60 billion of senior unsecured notes and distributed 59 billion of net proceeds to us in connection with the spinoff capitalization plan we used the proceeds to pay 36 billion of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and expect to use the remaining cash proceeds to pay down additional debt over time or for general corporate purposes this debt and approximately 260 million of related deferred financing costs were retained by kraft foods group in the spinoff 

on june 1 2012 900 million of our 625 notes matured the notes and accrued interest to date were repaid using primarily commercial paper borrowings which were subsequently repaid from 59 billion net proceeds received from the kraft foods group 60 billion notes issuance on june 4 2012

on november 1 2011 11 billion of our 5625 notes matured the notes and accrued interest to date were repaid with cash from operations 

we expect to continue to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 8 debt and borrowing arrangements  for further details of these debt offerings 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of december 31 2012 we had 112 billion remaining in longterm financing authority from our board of directors 

in the next twelve months 355 billion of longterm debt becomes due as follows 750 million in february 2013 1 billion in may 2013 and 18 billion in october 2013 we expect to fund these repayments with cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 12 commitments and contingencies  we enter into thirdparty guarantees primarily to cover the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of these transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2012 we had no material thirdparty guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 

in addition at december 31 2012 we were contingently liable for 516 million of guarantees related to our own performance these include letters of credit and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes 

as of december 31 2012 we and three of our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries are joint and several guarantors of 10 billion of indebtedness issued by an unrelated third party cadbury schweppes us finance llc and maturing on october 1 2013 following the spinoff one of the guarantors of this indebtedness became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of kraft foods group we have agreed to indemnify kraft foods group pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement in the event its subsidiary is called upon to satisfy its obligation under the guarantee 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2012 

 



 

       

equity and dividends 

equity 

as a result of the spinoff we divested 44 billion of kraft foods group net assets 43 billion of accumulated other comprehensive losses primarily related to the pension and other benefits plan net liabilities transferred to kraft foods group and 89 million of unearned compensation recorded within additional paid in capital in total we recorded a distribution of 88 billion to our shareholders in connection with the spinoff of kraft foods group on october 1 2012 see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the spinoff of kraft foods group  

stock plans 

in connection with the spinoff and divestiture of kraft foods group under the provisions of our existing plans employee stock option and restricted and deferred stock awards were adjusted to preserve the fair value of the awards immediately before and after the spinoff longterm incentive plan awards held by mondelēz international employees remained mondelēz international awards the underlying performance conditions for the mondelēz international longterm incentive plan awards were modified and are consistent with our original performance targets adjusted to reflect our standalone business no incremental compensation expense was recorded as a result of the modifications of the stock plan awards see note 11 stock plans  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our stock plans awards activity during 2012 2011 and 2010 and stock award modifications related to the spinoff 

dividends 

we paid dividends of 2058 million in 2012 2043 million in 2011 and 2175 million in 2010 the dividends paid relate to periods prior to the spinoff and are based on an annualized dividend rate of 116 per common share for these periods the 07 increase in 2012 reflects an increase in shares outstanding the decrease of 61 in 2011 reflects an additional dividend payment of 224 million in 2010 related to the cadbury acquisition following the spinoff we expect to pay an annualized dividend rate of 052 the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

2013 outlook 

we expect our 2013 organic net revenue growth to be at the low end of our longterm growth target of 5 to 7 percent additionally we expect our 2013 operating eps to be 152 to 157 reflecting average 2012 foreign currency rates and the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar announced on february 8 2013 

  

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we disclose nongaap financial measures so that you have the same financial data that we use to assist you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance 

our nongaap financial measures reflect how we evaluate our operating results currently as new events or circumstances arise these definitions could change over time 

 

   we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures may vary among other companies the nongaap financial measures presented in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of these nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of these nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below which have an impact on our us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables which reconcile us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures in this form 10k 

  

organic net revenues 

using the definition of “organic net revenues” above the only adjustments made to “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures integration program costs accounting calendar changes including the 53 rd week in 2011 and foreign currency rate fluctuations we believe that organic net revenues better reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results 

 



 

    

adjusted operating income 

using the definition of “adjusted operating income” above the only adjustments made to “operating income” from continuing operations the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude spinoff costs integration program costs 20122014 restructuring program costs acquisitionrelated costs and gains  losses on divestitures pension costs related to obligations transferred in the spinoff interest expense adjustment related to the spinoff transaction and operating income from divested businesses we also evaluate adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis we believe these measures provide improved comparability of operating results 

 

  

   

operating eps 

using the definition of “operating eps” above the only adjustments made to “diluted eps attributable to mondelēz international from continuing operations” the most comparable us gaap financial measure were to exclude spinoff costs integration program costs 20122014 restructuring program costs acquisition and related financing costs gains  losses on divestitures pension costs related to obligations transferred in the spinoff interest expense adjustment related to the spinoff transaction operating results from divested businesses and the 2010 us health care legislation change in prior periods we also evaluate operating eps on a constant currency basis we believe these measures provide improved comparability of operating results 

 

  

    




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to crosshedge a commodity exposure we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 9 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments we included our debt foreign currency forwards and futures swaps and options and commodity futures forwards and options in our var computation excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we used a “variance  covariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2012 and 2011 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2012 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were in millions 

 

 with the spinoff a significant portion of our primarily us derivative instruments were divested in the fourth quarter of 2012 the impacts presented in the table above have not been recast to reflect the divestiture for periods prior to the spinoff as it is impracticable to do so this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

reportable segments

see note 3 acquisitions and divestitures  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions 

customers 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 21 of our net revenues in 2011 compared with 23 in 2010 and 27 in 2009 our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 29 of our net revenues in 2011 compared with 31 in 2010 and 36 in 2009 our largest customer walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 12 of our net revenues in 2011 compared with 13 in 2010 and 16 in 2009 

seasonality 

demand for some of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events however overall sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our diversified product portfolio 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to currency exchange rates we also compete with generic products and retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price moreover improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

distribution and marketing 

our products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating we distribute our products through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities we use a combination of warehouse delivery and direct store delivery and use services of independent sales offices and agents primarily in some of our international locations 

our marketing efforts are conducted through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing in onair print outdoor and digital media ii consumer incentives such as coupons and contests and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

  

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners in addition we use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

significant cost items in chocolate confectionery products are cocoa and sugar we purchase cocoa and sugar on world markets and their prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the pound sterling and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean cocoa butter and sugar costs on average were higher in 2011 than in 2010 we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy products are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2011 than in 2010 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which we purchase on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2011 than in 2010 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant volatility and have increased from 2010 to 2011 due largely to burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel 

during 2011 our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of higher costs of coffee dairy grains and oils packaging materials other raw materials meat and nuts our commodity costs increased approximately 26 billion in 2011 and approximately 10 billion in 2010 compared to the prior year we expect the higher cost environment and commodity cost volatility to continue in 2012 

the prices for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products are affected by external factors such as weather conditions commodity market conditions currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs while the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

intellectual property 

our trademarks are material to our business we protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the us and in other markets where we sell our products trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in particular locations similarly we sell some products under brands we license from third parties including at december 31 2011 

 

  we also own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patents licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology know – how processes and related intellectual property rights to be of material importance to our operations while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business we have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending for a number of current and potential products including products licensed to others patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country 

  

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs we have approximately 3300 food scientists chemists and engineers working primarily in 15 key technology centers east hanover new jersey glenview illinois madison wisconsin tarrytown new york whippany new jersey banbury united kingdom bournville united kingdom curitiba brazil eysins switzerland paris france melbourne australia mexico city mexico munich germany reading united kingdom and suzhou china these technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and stateoftheart instruments research and development expense was 702 million in 2011 583 million in 2010 and 466 million in 2009 

regulation 

our us food products and packaging materials are primarily regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” or for products containing meat and poultry the us food safety and inspection service of the us department of agriculture these agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing distribution and labeling of food products we supported the food safety modernization act a 2011 law that provided additional food safety authority to the fda we do not expect the cost of complying with that law and implementing regulations expected over the next two to three years to be material 

in addition various states regulate our us operations by licensing plants enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants and warehouses regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

many of the food commodities we use in our us operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic us congressional and administrative review 

all of our nonus based operations are subject to local and national regulations some of which are similar to those applicable to our us operations for example in the european union we must comply with requirements that apply to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various laws and regulations in and outside of the us relating to the protection of the environment in the us the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and superfund the environmental program established in the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party at december 31 2011 our subsidiaries were involved in 68 active actions in the us under the superfund legislation and other similar actions and legislation related to our current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

outside the us we are subject to applicable multinational national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business outside the us we have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

as of december 31 2011 we accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results see note 1  summary of significant accounting policies for additional information on our environmental remediation programs 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we employed approximately 126000 people worldwide labor unions represent approximately 27 of our 36000 us employees most of the unionized workers at our us locations are represented under contracts with the bakery confectionery tobacco workers and grain millers international union the united food and commercial workers international union and the international brotherhood of teamsters these contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years outside the us labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 58 of our 90000 employees our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business unit in addition in accordance with european union requirements we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are generally good 

  

foreign operations 

we sell our products to consumers in approximately 170 countries at december 31 2011 we had operations in more than 80 countries and made our products at 220 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide we generated approximately 60 of our 2011 net revenues 57 of our 2010 net revenues and 49 of our 2009 net revenues outside the us refer to note 16 segment reporting for additional information on our foreign operations also for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations see “risk factors” in item 1a

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward – looking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward – looking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food industry is highly competitive we compete based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures competition and customer pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we reduce prices or increase costs but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

maintaining our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

we have many iconic brands with worldwide recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain extend and expand our brand image as the media and communications environment continues to evolve negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we must leverage our value proposition to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

retailers are increasingly offering retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as those we continue to experience consumers may not buy our products if the difference in value or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands narrows or if consumers perceive a narrowing if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings the impact could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect us 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the us the european union and our other major markets continue to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business consolidation also produces large more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands further retail consolidation and increasing retail power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during 2011 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 21 of our net revenues with our largest customer walmart stores inc accounting for approximately 12 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that all significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing and develop their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

disputes with significant suppliers including regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including dairy coffee beans cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our factories and warehouses prices for commodities other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather consumer or industrial demand and changes in governmental trade alternative energy and agricultural programs in addition speculative trading often exacerbates price volatility for 2011 our commodity costs were approximately 26 billion higher than for 2010 although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the price of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the proposed spinoff may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated if at all 

in august 2011 we announced our intention to become two independent publicly traded companies through a us taxfree spinoff of our north american grocery business to existing shareholders unanticipated developments could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect the proposed spinoff of the north american grocery business including possible problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances and disruptions in the capital and other financial markets among other things in addition consummation of the proposed spinoff will require final approval from our board of directors therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spinoff on the terms or on the timeline that we announced if at all 

  

in order to position ourselves for the proposed spinoff we are actively pursuing strategic structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our north american operations these actions could lead to disruption of our operations loss of or inability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses and complete the proposed spinoff weakening of our internal standards controls or procedures and impairment of our relationship with key customers and suppliers we have and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed spinoff in addition completion of the proposed spinoff will require significant amounts of our management’s time and effort which may divert management’s attention from operating and growing our businesses and could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if the spinoff is completed it may not achieve the intended results 

if the proposed spinoff is completed our operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the north american grocery business from our other businesses as a result our diversification of revenue sources will diminish and our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility further shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a smaller company with its business concentrated in the global snacks business these changes may not meet some shareholders’ investment strategies which could cause investors to sell their shares of our common stock excessive selling could cause the relative market price of our common stock to decrease following the consummation of the proposed spinoff 

in addition if the proposed spinoff is completed as the global snacks business our business in north america will be greatly reduced and a significantly greater proportion of our revenues will be derived from nonus operations accordingly the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report that are associated with operating a global business could increase if the proposed spinoff is completed 

changes in regulations could increase our costs and affect our profitability 

our activities in the united states and around the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations govern food production and marketing as well as licensing trade tax and environmental matters governing bodies regularly issue new regulations and changes to existing regulations our need to comply with new or revised regulations or their interpretation and application including proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we are a large food company operating in a highly regulated environment and a constantly evolving legal and regulatory framework around the world consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover the failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent risks we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a widespread product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate in a global environment which could affect our growth and financial performance 

we generated approximately 60 of our 2011 net revenues 57 of our 2010 net revenues and 49 of our 2009 net revenues outside the us with operations in more than 80 countries our operations are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 

          moreover political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain developing markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in developing markets including brazil china india mexico russia and southeast asia however some developing markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in developing markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand their production capacities our success in integrating cadbury’s operations and products many of which have a strong presence in a number of developing markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in developing markets our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

unanticipated business disruptions could affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability consistently to provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters fire terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

  

we must distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example recently consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sodium consumption we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may be unsuccessful in these efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we may not successfully complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including cadbury we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including the expected increases in revenues and operating results any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial results in addition we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our acquisition of cadbury and disposition of our frozen pizza business increased the portion of our assets liabilities and earnings denominated in nonus dollar currencies which increased our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are now more sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates than in prior periods because a larger portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for external reporting purposes or converted into us dollars to service obligations such as our us dollar – denominated indebtedness in addition movements in foreign exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations but our efforts may not be successful accordingly a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar or changes in the relative value of any two currencies that we use for transactions could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we are increasingly dependent on information technology and if we are unable to protect against service interruptions data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers around the world these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software databases or components thereof power outages hardware failures computer viruses attacks by computer hackers telecommunication failures user errors or catastrophic events if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results 

  

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches we may suffer financial and reputational damage or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers or suppliers in addition the disclosure of nonpublic sensitive information through external media channels could lead to the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation and brand image 

weak financial performance downgrades in our credit ratings illiquid capital markets and volatile economic conditions could limit our access to the capital markets reduce our liquidity or increase our borrowing costs 

from time to time we may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing our financial performance our shortand longterm credit ratings the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy including the food industry will affect our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future there can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable 

we access the commercial paper market for regular funding requirements a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit markets also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and could raise our borrowing costs for both shortand longterm debt offerings our inability to access the capital markets or an increase in our borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and have a negative impact on our operating results and profitability 

we sponsor a number of benefit plans for employees in the united states the united kingdom and many other nonus locations including defined benefit pension plans retiree health and welfare active health care severance and other postemployment benefits at the end of 2011 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 171 billion and assets were 134 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of investments including equities and corporate debt we also have an insignificant amount of trust assets invested in european and other sovereign debt among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns minimum funding requirements in the jurisdictions in which the plans operate arrangements made with the trustees of certain foreign plans and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements legislative and other governmental regulatory actions may also increase funding requirements for our pension plans’ benefits obligation 

based on current tax laws we estimate the 2012 pension contributions will be approximately 480 million which is approximately 420 million less than we contributed in 2011 we also expect that our net pension cost will increase to approximately 750 million in 2012 volatility in the global capital markets has increased the risk that we may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2012 

a significant increase in our us pension funding requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to invest in the business in addition if we divest certain businesses we may be required to increase future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic pension cost could increase

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we routinely are involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations “legal matters” arising in the ordinary course of our business 

competition authorities in certain member states of the european union have ongoing investigations into possible anticompetitive activity in the fast moving consumer goods “fmcg” sector which includes products such as chocolate and coffee on october 18 2011 the german federal cartel office “fco” issued a press release stating that it had discontinued proceedings against our wholly owned subsidiary kraft foods deutschland gmbh “kfd” based on a settlement agreed between kfd and the fco following the fco’s finding of illegal price agreements regarding instant cappuccino the fco also imposed a fine against a former kfd employee due to kfd’s cooperation with the fco in the matter the fine to resolve the matter was reduced to eur 22 million or approximately 3 million as of october 18 2011 

a compliant and ethical corporate culture which includes adhering to laws and industry regulations in all jurisdictions in which we do business is integral to our success accordingly after we acquired cadbury in february 2010 we began reviewing and adjusting as needed cadbury’s operations in light of us and international standards as well as kraft foods’ policies and practices we initially focused on such high priority areas as food safety the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and antitrust based upon cadbury’s preacquisition policies and compliance programs and our postacquisition reviews our preliminary findings indicated that cadbury’s overall state of compliance was sound nonetheless through our reviews we determined that in certain jurisdictions including india there appeared to be facts and circumstances warranting further investigation we are continuing our investigations in certain jurisdictions including in india and we continue to cooperate with governmental authorities 

on march 1 2011 the starbucks coffee company “starbucks” without our authorization and in what we contend is a violation and breach of our agreements with starbucks took control of the starbucks packaged coffee business “starbucks cpg business” in grocery stores and other channels after alleging we had breached the supply and license agreement the dispute is pending arbitration in chicago illinois we are seeking appropriate remedies including but not limited to payment of the fair market value of the supply and license agreement plus the premium this agreement specifies starbucks has counterclaimed for unspecified damages the arbitration proceeding is set to begin on july 11 2012 and is expected to conclude on july 31 2012 the results of the starbucks cpg business were included primarily in our us beverage and canada and na foodservice segments through march 1 2011 

as we previously disclosed on february 1 2011 we received a subpoena from the sec in connection with an investigation under the fcpa primarily related to a cadbury facility in india that we acquired in the cadbury acquisition the subpoena primarily requests information regarding dealings with indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals related to the operation of that facility we are cooperating with the us government in its investigation of these matters 

while we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal matters in which we are currently involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of these legal matters will have a material effect on our financial results

discussion and analysis 

strategy 

over the last several years we have transformed our portfolio by expanding geographically and building our presence in the fastgrowing snacking category at the same time we have continued to invest in product quality marketing and innovation behind our iconic north american brands while implementing a series of cost saving initiatives our global snacks business and the north american grocery business now have different future strategic priorities growth profiles and operational focus as such we expect that our proposed spinoff will provide both businesses an opportunity to pursue different strategies and achieve a distinct operational focus and return on investment 

the global snacks business will build upon its strong presence across numerous fastgrowing markets categories and channels including the highmargin instant consumption channel this business will target industryleading revenue growth leverage its cost structure through volume growth and improved product mix to drive margin gains and grow earnings per share in the toptier of its peer group 

the north american grocery business will build on its leading market positions by targeting moderate revenue growth while maintaining a sharp focus on its cost structure and superior execution this business will target revenue growth in line with its categories strong margins and free cash flow and expects to have a highly competitive dividend payout 

items affecting comparability of financial results 

acquisitions and divestitures 

cadbury acquisition 

on february 2 2010 we acquired 7173 of cadbury limited “cadbury” and as of june 1 2010 we owned 100 of all outstanding cadbury shares see note 3 acquisitions and divestitures  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as part of our cadbury acquisition we incurred and expensed transaction related fees of 218 million in 2010 and 40 million in 2009 we recorded these expenses within selling general and administrative expenses we also incurred acquisition financing fees of 96 million in 2010 we recorded these expenses within interest and other expense net 

to secure eu regulatory approval of the acquisition we were required to divest certain cadbury confectionery operations in poland and romania in 2010 we completed the sale of the assets of these businesses and generated 342 million in sale proceeds the impacts of these divestitures were primarily reflected as adjustments to the cadbury purchase price allocations 

cadbury contributed net revenues of 9143 million and net earnings of 530 million from february 2 2010 through december 31 2010 the following unaudited pro forma summary presents kraft foods’ consolidated information as if cadbury had been acquired on january 1 2009 these amounts were calculated after conversion to us gaap applying our accounting policies and adjusting cadbury’s results to reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property plant and equipment and intangible assets had been applied from january 1 2009 together with the consequential tax effects these adjustments also reflect the additional interest expense incurred on the debt to finance the purchase and the divestitures of certain cadbury confectionery operations in poland and romania 

 



  

our february 2 2010 cadbury acquisition was valued at 18547 million or 17503 million net of cash and cash equivalents as part of that acquisition we acquired the following assets and assumed the following liabilities in millions

integration program and cost savings initiatives 

integration program 

our combination with cadbury continues to have the potential for meaningful synergies and costs savings we now expect to recognize approximately 800 million of cost savings by the end of the third year following completion of the acquisition up from our original estimate of 750 million additionally we expect to create revenue synergies from investments in distribution marketing and product development in order to achieve these cost savings and synergies we expect to incur total integration charges of approximately 15 billion in the first three years following the acquisition to combine and integrate the two businesses the “integration program” 

integration program costs include the costs associated with combining our operations with cadbury’s and are separate from the costs related to the acquisition we incurred charges under the integration program of 521 million in 2011 and 657 million in 2010 we recorded these charges primarily in operations as a part of selling general and administrative expenses within our kraft foods europe and kraft foods developing markets segments as well as general corporate expenses since the inception of the integration program we have incurred approximately 12 billion of the 15 billion in expected charges at december 31 2011 we had an accrual of 346 million related to the integration program see note 7 integration program and cost savings initiatives  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

cost savings initiatives 

cost savings initiatives generally include exit disposal and other project costs and consisted of the following specific initiatives 

   within our integration program and cost savings initiatives we include certain costs along with exit and disposal costs that are directly attributable to these activities and do not qualify for treatment as exit or disposal costs under us gaap these costs which we commonly refer to as other project costs or implementation costs generally include the integration and reorganization of operations and facilities the discontinuance of certain product lines and the incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities we believe the disclosure of these charges within our operating income provides greater transparency of the impact of these programs and initiatives on our operating results 

  

starbucks cpg business 

on march 1 2011 the starbucks coffee company “starbucks” without our authorization and in what we contend is a violation and breach of our agreements with starbucks took control of the starbucks packaged coffee business “starbucks cpg business” in grocery stores and other channels after alleging we had breached the supply and license agreement the dispute is pending arbitration in chicago illinois we are seeking appropriate remedies including but not limited to payment of the fair market value of the supply and license agreement plus the premium this agreement specifies starbucks has counterclaimed for unspecified damages the arbitration proceeding is set to begin on july 11 2012 and is expected to conclude on july 31 2012 the results of the starbucks cpg business were included primarily in our us beverage and canada and na foodservice segments through march 1 2011 

accounting calendar changes in 2011 and 2010 

the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last saturday of the year a portion of our international operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day or the last saturday of the year because a significant number of our operating subsidiaries report results on the last saturday of the year and this year that day fell on december 31 our results included an extra week “53 rd week” of operating results than in the prior two years which had 52weeks 

in 2011 we changed the consolidation date for certain operations of our kraft foods europe segment and in the latin america and central and eastern europe middle east and africa “ceema” regions within our kraft foods developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period now our kraft foods europe segment reports results as of the last saturday of each period our operations in latin america and certain operations in ceema report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last saturday of the period these changes and the 53 rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of approximately 920 million and a favorable impact of approximately 150 million to operating income in 2011 

in 2010 we changed the consolidation date for certain european biscuits operations which are included within our kraft foods europe segment and certain operations in asia pacific and latin america within our kraft foods developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported periodend results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period kraft foods europe moved the reporting of these operations to two weeks prior to the end of the period and asia pacific and latin america moved the reporting of these operations to the last day of the period these changes resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of approximately 200 million and had an insignificant impact on operating income in 2010 

we believe these changes are preferable and will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our kraft foods europe segment and kraft foods developing markets segment and by bringing the reporting date closer to the periodend date as the effect to priorperiod results was not material we have not revised priorperiod results 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 257 in 2011 315 in 2010 and 288 in 2009 our 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of 199 million from discrete onetime events primarily from the revaluation of uk deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted in 2011 that reduced uk corporate income tax rates the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets that are now expected to be realized and the net favorable impact from various us federal us state and foreign tax audit developments during the year the 2011 effective tax rate also reflects increased tax benefits from operations outside the united states which are generally taxed at lower rates than the us statutory rate of 35 percent the mix of pretax income from these various foreign jurisdictions can have a significant impact on our effective tax rate the fourth quarter and full year tax rate benefited from lower than projected taxes on our earnings outside the us and the fourth quarter was also favorable due to a trueup of prior quarter estimates to a lower actual tax expense reported by these operations 

our 2010 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 123 million primarily due to the favorable resolution of a federal tax audit and the resolution of several items in our international operations partially offset by a 137 million writeoff of deferred tax assets as a result of the us health care legislation enacted in march 2010 

our 2009 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 225 million primarily due to an agreement we reached with the irs on specific matters related to years 2000 through 2003 settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the divestiture of our balance bar operations in the us

venezuela – in the fourth quarter of 2009 the venezuelan economy was classified as highly inflationary under us gaap effective january 1 2010 we began accounting for our venezuelan subsidiaries under highly inflationary accounting rules which principally means all transactions are recorded in us dollars we use both the official venezuelan bolivar exchange rate and the governmentregulated transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities “sitme” rate to translate our venezuelan operations into us dollars based on the nature of the operations of each individual subsidiary 

  

we recorded approximately 10 million of favorable foreign currency impacts relating to highly inflationary accounting in venezuela during 2011 and approximately 115 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts during 2010 the 2010 loss included a onetime impact of 34 million to translate cash we previously recorded at the secondary market exchange rate 

we do not expect our 2012 operating results to be significantly affected by changes in venezuelan foreign currency 

critical accounting policies 

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include kraft foods as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last saturday of the year a portion of our international operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day or the last saturday of the year because a significant number of our operating subsidiaries report results on the last saturday of the year and this year that day fell on december 31 our results included an extra week “53 rd week” of operating results than in the prior two years which had 52weeks 

in 2011 we changed the consolidation date for certain operations of our kraft foods europe segment and in the latin america and central and eastern europe middle east and africa “ceema” regions within our kraft foods developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period now our kraft foods europe segment reports results as of the last saturday of each period our operations in latin america and certain operations in ceema report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last saturday of the period these changes and the 53 rd week in 2011 resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of approximately 920 million and a favorable impact of approximately 150 million to operating income in 2011 

in 2010 we changed the consolidation date for certain european biscuits operations which are included within our kraft foods europe segment and certain operations in asia pacific and latin america within our kraft foods developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported periodend results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period kraft foods europe moved the reporting of these operations to two weeks prior to the end of the period and asia pacific and latin america moved the reporting of these operations to the last day of the period these changes resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of approximately 200 million and had an insignificant impact on operating income in 2010 

we believe these changes are preferable and will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our kraft foods europe segment and kraft foods developing markets segment and by bringing the reporting date closer to the periodend date as the effect to priorperiod results was not material we have not revised priorperiod results 

we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence 2050 ownership interest under the equity method of accounting we use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20 and in which we do not exercise significant influence noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of kraft foods all intercompany transactions are eliminated 

use of estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions include among others pension and benefit plan assumptions valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets useful lives of longlived assets marketing program accruals insurance and selfinsurance reserves and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which we know the actual amounts historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market we value all our inventories using the average cost method we also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes 

longlived assets 

we review longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of assets held for use we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

in 2011 there were no asset impairments recorded in 2010 we recorded an asset impairment of 12 million on a biscuit plant and related property plant and equipment in france in 2009 we recorded a 9 million asset impairment charge to write off an investment in norway 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually on october 1 we assess goodwill impairment risk by first performing a qualitative review of entityspecific industry market and general economic factors for each reporting unit if significant potential goodwill impairment risk exists for a specific reporting unit we apply a twostep quantitative test the first step compares the reporting unit’s estimated fair value with its carrying value we estimate a reporting unit’s fair value using a 20year projection of discounted cash flows which incorporates planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of residual value for reporting units within our kraft foods north america and kraft foods europe geographic units we used a marketbased weightedaverage cost of capital of 68 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for reporting units within our kraft foods developing markets geographic unit we used a riskrated discount rate of 98 estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans industry and economic conditions and our actual results and conditions may differ over time if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds its fair value the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value we test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets is determined using planned growth rates marketbased discount rates and estimates of royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value we record intangible asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs 

in 2011 there were no impairments of goodwill or nonamortizable intangible assets in 2010 we also noted no goodwill impairment and disclosed five reporting units which were more sensitive to nearterm changes in discounted cash flow assumptions in 2011 we noted only one reporting unit us salty snacks which continues to be sensitive primarily to ongoing significant input cost pressure us salty snacks has 1170 million of goodwill as of december 31 2011 and its excess fair value over the carrying value of its net assets improved from 12 in 2010 to 19 in 2011 while the reporting unit passed the first step of the impairment test by a substantial margin if its operating income were to decline significantly in the future it would adversely affect the estimated fair value of the reporting unit if input costs were to continue to rise we expect to take further pricing actions as we have done in 2011 however if we are unsuccessful in these efforts it would decrease profitability negatively affect the estimated fair value of the us salty snacks reporting unit and could lead to a potential impairment in the future 

during our 2010 review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded a 13 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands and a 30 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in china 

during our 2009 review we recorded a 12 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands 

insurance and selfinsurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation general liability automobile liability product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers our shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales provisions for product returns and customer allowances are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized 

  

marketing and research and development 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred advertising expense was 2396 million in 2011 2270 million in 2010 and 1581 million in 2009 we expense costs as incurred for product research and development research and development expense was 702 million in 2011 583 million in 2010 and 466 million in 2009 we record marketing and research and development expenses within selling general and administrative expenses 

environmental costs 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable at december 31 2011 our subsidiaries were involved in 68 active actions in the us under superfund legislation and other similar actions and legislation related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

outside the us we are subject to applicable multinational national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business outside the us we have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

as of december 31 2011 we accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 

employee benefit plans 

we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits consisting primarily of severance we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries refer to note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 

we recorded the following amounts in earnings for these employee benefit plans during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 



the 2011 net expense for employee benefit plans of 1022 million increased by 71 million over the 2010 amount the cost increase primarily related to higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences for the us pension plans and the incorporation of a canadian postemployment plan into our obligations the 2010 net expense for employee benefit plans of 951 million increased by 164 million over the 2009 amount the cost increase primarily related to higher pension plan costs including costs associated with the cadbury acquisition and higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences 

  

the 2011 other comprehensive losses included 23 billion of net actuarial pretax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2011 68 basis point decrease for us plans and 49 basis point decrease for nonus plans unfavorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2011 60 basis point decrease for us plans and 73 basis point decrease for our nonus plans the 2010 other comprehensive earnings included 361 million of net actuarial pretax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december 31 2010 40 basis point decrease for us plans and 10 basis point decrease for nonus plans and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december 31 2010 40 basis point decrease for us plans and 23 basis point decrease for our nonus plans partially offset by favorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets 

in 2011 we contributed 538 million to our us pension plans and 361 million to our nonus pension plans in addition employees contributed 26 million to our nonus plans of our 2011 pension contributions approximately 495 million was voluntary we make contributions to our us and nonus pension plans primarily to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability for our us qualified pension plans in 2012 we are currently only required to make a nominal cash contribution to our us pension plans under the pension protection act of 2006 based on current tax law we estimate that 2012 pension contributions would be approximately 55 million to our us plans and approximately 425 million to our nonus plans of the total 2012 pension contributions none is expected to be voluntary our actual contributions may be different due to many factors including changes in tax and other benefit laws significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates or other factors 

we expect our 2012 net expense for employee benefit plans to increase by approximately 180 million primarily due to a weightedaverage decrease of 68 basis points in our us pension discount rate assumptions and 49 basis points in our nonus pension discount rate assumptions 

in 2009 our us pension plans were amended we are freezing our us pension plans for current salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective december 31 2019 pension accruals for all salaried and nonunion employees who are currently earning pension benefits will end on december 31 2019 and continuing pay and service will be used to calculate the pension benefits through december 31 2019 our projected benefit obligation decreased 168 million in 2009 and we incurred a 5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze beginning in 2010 our annual us pension plan costs decreased by approximately 40 million as a result of this change additionally for salaried and nonunion hourly employees hired in the us after january 1 2009 we discontinued benefits under our us pension plans and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan this did not have a significant impact on our 2011 2010 or 2009 pension plan costs 

for our postretirement plans our 2012 health care cost trend rate assumption decreased to 700 from 750 for our us postretirement plans and decreased to 742 from 883 for our nonus postretirement plans we established these rates based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 500 for us plans by 2016 and 553 for nonus plans by 2016 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects as of december 31 2011 

 



our 2012 discount rate assumption decreased to 470 from 530 for our us postretirement plans and decreased to 429 from 502 for our nonus postretirement plans our 2012 discount rate decreased to 485 from 553 for our us pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations our 2012 discount rate assumption for our nonus pension plans decreased to 462 from 511 we developed the discount rates for our nonus plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2012 expected rate of return on plan assets increased to 800 from 795 for our us pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

  

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2012 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rate or a fiftybasis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease in cost as of december 31 2011 

 

 financial instruments 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management strategies that seek to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates principally through the use of derivative instruments 

financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for hedges of forecasted transactions the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions must be specifically identified and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur if we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently 

by using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we have exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk we are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments 

we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge to the extent that the hedge is effective are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

we also have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreigncurrencydenominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates we designated our euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall european operations the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated european operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings the change in the debt’s fair value is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses 

  

income taxes 

we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when our uncertain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

new accounting guidance 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 

contingencies 

see note 13 commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 

commodity trends 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners in addition we use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

significant cost items in chocolate confectionery products are cocoa and sugar we purchase cocoa and sugar on world markets and the prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the pound sterling and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean cocoa butter and sugar costs on average were higher in 2011 than in 2010 we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy products are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2011 than in 2010 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2011 than in 2010 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant volatility and have increased from 2010 to 2011 due largely to burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel 

during 2011 our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of higher costs of coffee dairy grains and oils packaging materials other raw materials meat and nuts our commodity costs increased approximately 26 billion in 2011 and approximately 10 billion in 2010 compared to the prior year we expect the higher cost environment and commodity cost volatility to continue in 2012 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our cash from operations our existing 45 billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper program and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program and primarily uncommitted international credit lines for regular funding requirements we also use shortterm intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 45 billion in 2011 37 billion in 2010 and 51 billion in 2009 the increase in operating cash flows in 2011 is primarily related to increased earnings from continuing operations and the absence of tax payments in the prior year in connection with the frozen pizza divestiture partially offset by higher working capital mainly higher inventory costs increased interest payments and increased integration spending and a 495 million voluntary contribution to our us pension plans the decrease in operating cash flows in 2010 was primarily related to the estimated tax payments on the frozen pizza divestiture increased inventory levels and the unfavorable impact of acquisitionrelated financing fees partially offset by increased earnings 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 17 billion in 2011 75 billion in 2010 and 12 billion in 2009 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2011 primarily related to cash payments in the prior year related to the 2010 cadbury acquisition partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the frozen pizza business and from the divestitures in poland and romania the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2010 primarily related to the cadbury acquisition partially offset by higher proceeds from divestitures during 2010 we paid 98 billion in net cash for the cadbury acquisition and we received 37 billion in proceeds from the sale of the frozen pizza business and 03 billion in proceeds from the divestitures in poland and romania during 2009 we divested our balance bar operations in the us a juice operation in brazil and a plant in spain and received 41 million in net proceeds 

capital expenditures which were funded by operating activities were 18 billion in 2011 17 billion in 2010 and 13 billion in 2009 the 2011 capital expenditures were primarily used to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately 2 billion including capital expenditures required for systems investments and the integration program we expect to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash provided by  used in financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 32 billion in 2011 42 billion provided in 2010 and 31 billion used in 2009 the net cash used in 2011 primarily related to 20 billion in dividends paid 11 billion in longterm debt repayments and 565 million in repayments of shortterm borrowings partially offset by 492 million in proceeds from primarily stock option exercises the net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 primarily related to proceeds from our longterm debt issuance of 94 billion partially offset by 22 billion in dividends paid 21 billion in longterm debt repayments primarily related to our repurchase of 15 billion in notes through our tender offer and 864 million in net repayments of shortterm borrowings the net cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to 17 billion in dividend payments 950 million in repayments of longterm debt and 344 million in net commercial paper repayments additionally other cash used in financing activities in 2009 included 69 million in costs related to our bridge facility agreement dated november 9 2009 the “cadbury bridge facility” 

borrowing arrangements 

on april 1 2011 we entered into an agreement for a 45 billion fouryear senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in april 2015 the agreement replaced our former revolving credit agreement which was terminated upon the signing of the new agreement we intend to use the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes including for working capital purposes and to support our commercial paper issuances as of december 31 2011 no amounts have been drawn on the facility 

the revolving credit agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum total shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses of at least 286 billion at december 31 2011 our total shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses was 419 billion we expect to continue to meet this covenant the revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations covenants and events of default however the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security 

in addition to the above some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet shortterm working capital needs collectively these credit lines amounted to 23 billion at december 31 2011 and 24 billion at december 31 2010 borrowings on these lines amounted to 182 million at december 31 2011 and 267 million at december 31 2010

longterm debt 

our total debt was 269 billion at december 31 2011 and 287 billion at december 31 2010 our debttocapitalization ratio was 043 at december 31 2011 and 044 at december 31 2010 at december 31 2011 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 93 years 

on january 10 2012 we issued 800 million of floating rate notes maturing in 2013 which bear interest at a rate equal to the threemonth london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 0875 we intend to use the net proceeds of 7988 million for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of debt the notes have a special mandatory redemption upon public announcement of the record date for the proposed spinoff of our north american grocery business to our shareholders we will be required to issue a notice of redemption of all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100 of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest through the day prior to the redemption date 

on november 1 2011 we repaid 11 billion of our longterm debt with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings 

on december 29 2010 we repurchased 900 million principal amount of our 5625 notes due 2011 and 600 million principal amount of our 625 notes due 2012 which were validly tendered pursuant to the cash tender offers we initiated in november 2010 we paid 1596 million aggregate consideration including accrued and unpaid interest for the accepted notes in december 2010

in the next twelve months 37 billion of longterm debt becomes due as follows € 20 billion approximately 26 billion in march 2012 900 million in june 2012 and c150 million approximately 147 million due in august 2012 we expect to fund these repayments with cash from operations the issuance of commercial paper and the issuance of additional debt we do not expect to repatriate earnings from our nonus operations to meet these obligations 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors as of december 31 2011 we had 12 billion remaining in longterm financing authority from our board of directors 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 13 commitments and contingencies  we have thirdparty guarantees primarily covering the longterm obligations of our vendors as part of those transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2011 the carrying amount of our thirdparty guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet and the maximum potential payments under these guarantees was 22 million substantially all of these guarantees expire at various times through 2018 

in addition at december 31 2011 we were contingently liable for 471 million of guarantees related to our own performance these include letters of credit related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes and other letters of credit 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity

2012 outlook 

our outlook for 2012 reflects confidence in continuing our strong business momentum in a challenging environment of weak consumer and category growth as well as significant input cost inflation 

we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of approximately 5 percent including a negative impact of up to one percentage point from product pruning in north america operating eps is expected to grow at least 9 percent on a constant currency basis 

nongaap financial measures 

we use certain nongaap financial measures to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have disclosed the following measures so that you have the same financial data that we use with the intention of assisting you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance 

we believe that the presentation of these nonus gaap financial measures when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures because nongaap financial measures may vary among other companies the nongaap financial measures presented in the consolidated results of operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of nongaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure a limitation of the nongaap financial measures is they exclude items detailed below which have an impact on us gaap reported results the best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our nongaap financial measures in combination with our us gaap reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables which reconcilie us gaap reported figures to the nongaap financial measures 

organic net revenues 

we use the nonus gaap financial measure “organic net revenues” and corresponding growth ratios the difference between “organic net revenues” and “net revenues” the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that organic net revenues exclude the impact of acquisitions divestitures including for reporting purposes the starbucks cpg business currency and accounting calendar changes including the 53 rd week in 2011 we believe that organic net revenues better reflect the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provide improved comparability of results 

 



  

 



note in 2011 we revised our organic net revenues to exclude the effect of accounting calendar changes as the impact from new accounting calendar changes was significant in 2011 as such we have conformed our 2010 organic net revenues to be consistent with the current year presentation 

 

    underlying operating income 

we use the nonus gaap financial measure “underlying operating income” and corresponding growth ratios the difference between “underlying operating income” and “operating income” the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that underlying operating income exclude costs related to the integration program and acquisitionrelated costs including transaction advisory fees uk stamp taxes and the impact of the cadbury inventory revaluation and costs associated with the proposed spinoff of the north american grocery business we believe that underlying operating income provide improved comparability of operating results 

 

   

operating eps 

we use the nonus gaap financial measure “operating eps” and corresponding growth ratios the difference between “operating eps” and “diluted eps attributable to kraft foods from continuing operations” the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that operating eps exclude costs related to the integration program acquisitionrelated costs including transaction advisory fees uk stamp taxes and the impact of the cadbury inventory revaluation acquisitionrelated financing fees including hedging and foreign currency impacts associated with the cadbury acquisition and other fees associated with the cadbury bridge facility the impact of a deferred tax charge resulting from the recently enacted us health care legislation and costs associated with the proposed spinoff of the north american grocery business we believe operating eps provide improved comparability of operating results 

 



 

   adjusted free cash flow 

in addition we use the nonus gaap financial measure “adjusted free cash flow” the difference between “adjusted free cash flow” and “net cash provided by operating activities” the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that adjusted free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures exclude voluntary pension contributions and in 2010 exclude the impact of taxes paid on the divestiture of our frozen pizza business we use adjusted free cash flow as the primary cash flow metric as it represents controllable cash flows from operations 

 



note in 2011 we revised our free cash flow measure to exclude the effect of voluntary pension contributions and the taxes paid on the frozen pizza divestiture and now refer to this measure as adjusted free cash flow as such we have conformed our 2010 and 2009 information to be consistent with the current year presentation 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to crosshedge a commodity exposure we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments we included our debt foreign currency forwards and futures swaps and options and commodity futures forwards and options in our var computation excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 

we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we used a “variance  covariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2011 and 2010 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

as of december 31 2011 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments as calculated in the var model were in millions 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by kraft foods nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

because kraft foods inc is a holding company our principal source of funds is from our subsidiaries our wholly owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

reportable segments 

we manage and report operating results through three geographic units kraft foods north america kraft foods europe and kraft foods developing markets we manage the operations of kraft foods north america and kraft 

  

foods europe by product category and we manage the operations of kraft foods developing markets by location our reportable segments are us beverages us cheese us convenient meals us grocery us snacks canada  north america foodservice kraft foods europe and kraft foods developing markets the results of operations from our cadbury limited formerly cadbury plc “cadbury” acquisition are reflected within our us snacks canada  na foodservice kraft foods europe and kraft foods developing markets segments

 significant acquisitions and divestitures 

cadbury acquisition

see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions 

customers 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 26 of our net revenues in 2010 compared with 27 in 2009 and 2008 our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 35 of our net revenues in 2010 compared with 36 in 2009 and 2008 one of our customers walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 14 of our net revenues in 2010 compared with 16 in 2009 and 2008 

seasonality 

demand for some of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events however overall sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our diversified product portfolio 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to currency exchange rates we also compete with generic products and retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price moreover improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

distribution and marketing 

our products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food 

  

outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating we distribute our products through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities we currently distribute most products in north america through a combination of direct store delivery and warehouse delivery outside of north america our products are distributed through warehouse delivery and through the services of independent sales offices and agents 

our marketing efforts are conducted through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing in onair print outdoor and digital media ii consumer incentives such as coupons and contests and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners in addition we use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

significant cost items in chocolate confectionery products are cocoa and sugar we purchase cocoa and sugar on world markets and their prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the pound sterling and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean cocoa butter and sugar costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009 we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy products are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which we purchase on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel grain costs on average decreased from 2009 to 2010 

during 2010 our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of higher cocoa sugar dairy coffee and meat costs partially offset by lower grain costs for 2010 our commodity costs were approximately 10 billion higher than 2009 following a decrease of approximately 150 million in 2009 compared to 2008 overall we expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile and to further increase in 2011 

the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

intellectual property 

we consider our trademarks in the aggregate to be material to our business we protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the us and in other markets where we sell our products trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in particular locations similarly we sell some products under brands we license from third parties including at december 31 2010 

 

      

additionally we own numerous patents worldwide while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business we have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of current and potential products including products licensed to others patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country we consider that in the aggregate our patent applications patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations 

we also have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights that are not registered 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs we have approximately 3300 food scientists chemists and engineers working primarily in 15 key technology centers east hanover new jersey glenview illinois madison wisconsin tarrytown new york whippany new jersey banbury united kingdom bournville united kingdom curitiba brazil eysins switzerland paris france melbourne australia mexico city mexico munich germany reading united kingdom and suzhou china these technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and stateoftheart instruments research and development expense was 583 million in 2010 466 million in 2009 and 487 million in 2008 

regulation 

our us food products and packaging materials are primarily regulated by the us food and drug administration “fda” or for products containing meat and poultry the us food safety and inspection service of the us department of agriculture these agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing distribution and labeling of food products we supported the recently enacted law that provides additional food safety authority to the fda we do not expect the cost of complying with that law and implementing regulations expected over the next two to three years to be material 

in addition various states regulate our us operations by licensing plants enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants and warehouses regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

many of the food commodities we use in our us operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic us congressional and administrative review 

all of our nonus based operations are subject to local and national regulations some of which are similar to those applicable to our us operations for example in the european union we must comply with requirements that apply to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various laws and regulations in and outside of the us relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable 

  

in the us the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and superfund the environmental program established in the comprehensive environmental response compensation and recovery act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party at december 31 2010 our subsidiaries were involved in 74 active actions in the us under superfund legislation and other similar actions and legislation related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

outside the us we are subject to applicable multinational national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business outside the us we have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

as of december 31 2010 we had accrued an insignificant amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions 

employees 

at december 31 2010 we employed approximately 127000 people worldwide labor unions represent approximately 27 of our 37000 us employees most of the unionized workers at our us locations are represented under contracts with the bakery confectionery tobacco workers and grain millers international union the united food and commercial workers international union and the international brotherhood of teamsters these contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years outside the us labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 55 of our 90000 employees our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business unit in addition in accordance with european union requirements we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

foreign operations 

we sell our products to consumers in approximately 170 countries at december 31 2010 we had operations in more than 75 countries and made our products at 223 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide we generated approximately 57 of our 2010 net revenues 49 of our 2009 net revenues and 50 of our 2008 net revenues outside the us

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the food industry is highly competitive we compete based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures in order to maintain our market share competition and customer pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to 

  

commodity and other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts despite these expenditures we may not successfully maintain or enhance market share if we reduce prices or increase costs but we cannot increase sales volumes to offset those changes then our financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

maintaining our reputation and brand image is essential to our business success 

many of our brands are iconic with worldwide recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings 

we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation continuing global focus on health and wellness including weight management and increasing media attention to the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of food marketing practices increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to such restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns we are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions on how and to whom we market our products for instance marketing to children these restrictions may limit our ability to maintain extend and expand our brand image as the media and communications environment continues to evolve if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we must leverage our value proposition to compete against retailer brands and other economy brands 

retailers are increasingly offering retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products our products must provide higher value and  or quality to our consumers than less expensive alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as those we continue to experience consumers may not buy our products if the difference in value or quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands narrows or if consumers perceive a narrowing if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix could shift to lower margin offerings these effects could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect us 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the us the european union and our other major markets continue to consolidate resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business consolidation also produces large more sophisticated retail customers that can resist price increases and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands further retail consolidation may materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers’ business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us for example if our customers do not have access to sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or refuse to pay us for previous purchases 

changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect us 

during 2010 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 26 of our net revenues with our largest customer walmart stores inc accounting for approximately 14 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that all significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

  

disputes with significant suppliers including regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

commodity and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our factories and warehouses prices for commodities other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs for example unusually adverse weather conditions such as the heat wave in the grain growing regions of russia and ukraine and recent severe drought in the grain growing regions of china have contributed to rising wheat and corn costs in 2010 and we expect such conditions to continue in 2011 for 2010 our commodity costs were approximately 10 billion higher than 2009 although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against price increases continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover price increases to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in regulations could increase our costs and affect our profitability 

our activities in the united states and around the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various federal state provincial and local laws and regulations govern food production and marketing as well as licensing trade tax and environmental matters governing bodies regularly issue new regulations and changes to existing regulations our need to comply with new or revised regulations or their interpretation and application including proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

we are a large food company that operates in a highly regulated highly competitive environment with growing retailer power and a constantly evolving legal and regulatory framework around the world consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover the failure to maintain effective control environment processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation and profitability 

product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent risks we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering any of these events could adversely affect our reputation and product sales financial condition or results of operations 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a widespread product recall may materially and adversely affect our profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to risks generally associated with companies that operate in a global environment which could affect our growth and financial performance 

we generated approximately 57 of our 2010 net revenues 49 of our 2009 net revenues and 50 of our 2008 net revenues outside the us with operations in more than 75 countries our operations are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations those risks include 

 

          moreover political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

our operations in certain developing markets expose us to political economic and regulatory risks 

our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to expand our operations in developing markets including brazil china india mexico russia and southeast asia however some developing markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than established markets in many countries outside of the us particularly in those with developing economies it may be common for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery laws these laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition competition in developing markets is increasing as our competitors grow their global operations and low cost local manufacturers expand their production capacities our success in integrating cadbury’s operations and products many of which have a strong presence in a number of developing markets is critical to our growth strategy if we cannot successfully increase our business in developing markets our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

unanticipated business disruptions could affect our ability to provide our products to our customers 

we have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability consistently to provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters fire terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers’ or comanufacturers’ operations if we are unable to respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late or unable to deliver products to our customers if that were to occur our customers’ confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

  

we must distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products sufficient to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example recently consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sodium consumption we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may be unsuccessful in these efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

increased or unanticipated costs or difficulties encountered in our continuing integration of cadbury could affect our results of operations 

we continue to integrate the operations of our cadbury business into our existing business we expect the anticipated synergies of integration to increase revenues and operating results through enhanced growth opportunities and increased cost savings if we encounter difficulties in fully integrating the businesses it could delay or we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including the expected increases in revenues and operating results if the difficulties are significant our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

additionally we expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with combining our operations including implementation cash costs that we estimate will be approximately 15 billion in the first three years following completion of the acquisition delays in integrating the businesses could cause such costs to be significantly higher than anticipated 

we may not successfully complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures or integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses including cadbury our financial results could be materially and adversely affected in addition we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses may affect our profitability moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our profitability 

our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include diversion of management attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems effective and immediate implementation of control environment processes across our diverse employee population adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these factors could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

our acquisition of cadbury and disposition of our frozen pizza business increased the portion of our assets liabilities and earnings denominated in nonus dollar currencies which increased our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our financial results and capital ratios are now more sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates than in prior periods because a larger portion of our assets liabilities revenue and expenses must be translated into us dollars for external reporting purposes in addition movements in foreign exchange rates can affect transaction costs because we source product ingredients from various countries we may seek to mitigate our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations but our efforts may not be successful accordingly a depreciation of nonus dollar currencies relative to the us dollar or changes in the relative value of any two currencies that we use for transactions could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

business process improvement initiatives to harmonize our systems and processes may fail to operate as designed and intended 

we regularly implement business process improvement initiatives designed to harmonize our systems and processes and improve our performance significant current business process improvement initiatives include reorganization of our european operations delivery of a sap enterprise resource planning application and outsourcing certain administrative functions our business process improvement initiatives may not be successful or may interfere with our core business operations or divert management attention from those operations if we are unable to improve existing operations achieve anticipated cost savings and support future growth our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

downgrades in our credit ratings and other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market could reduce our liquidity or increase our borrowing costs and liquidity 

our short and longterm credit ratings affect our borrowing costs and access to financing a downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper we access the commercial paper market for regular funding requirements disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market also could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue and could raise our borrowing costs for both short and longterm debt offerings 

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and have a negative impact on our operating results and profitability 

at the end of 2010 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 156 billion and assets were 133 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the level of plan funding cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and increase our future funding requirements in addition if we divest certain businesses we may be required to increase future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic pension cost could increase 

we expect to make approximately 940 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2011 which is approximately 550 million more than we made in 2010 we also expect that our net pension cost will remain flat at approximately 530 million in 2011 volatile economic conditions increase the risk that we may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2011 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

not applicable 




 item 2 properties 

we have 223 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide this includes the 62 manufacturing and process facilities we obtained as part of our cadbury acquisition these facilities are located in 57 countries we have 57 facilities in kraft foods north america 59 in kraft foods europe and 107 in kraft foods developing markets 

we own 214 and lease 9 of these manufacturing and processing facilities it is our practice to maintain all of our plants and properties in good condition and we believe they are suitable and adequate for our present needs

 these facilities are in good condition and we believe they have sufficient capacity to meet our distribution needs in the near term 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we routinely are involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations “legal matters” arising in the ordinary course of our business 

on november 29 2010 we initiated an arbitration proceeding against starbucks coffee company “starbucks” to challenge starbucks attempt to end our retail coffee agreement without compensating us pursuant to the agreement’s termination provisions on december 6 2010 in a separate proceeding we filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the us district court for the southern district of new york against starbucks to enjoin starbucks from unilaterally terminating our agreement the district court denied our motion for preliminary injunction on january 28 2011 on february 25 2011 the us court of appeals for the second circuit upheld the us district court’s ruling despite this ruling our arbitration proceeding which we are vigorously pursuing will continue 

a compliant and ethical corporate culture which includes adhering to laws and industry regulations in the united states and abroad is integral to our success to this end after we acquired cadbury in february 2010 we began reviewing and adjusting as needed cadbury’s operations in light of us and international standards as well as kraft foods’ policies and practices we initially focused on such high priority areas as food safety the foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and antitrust based upon cadbury’s preacquisition policies and compliance programs and our postacquisition reviews our preliminary findings indicated that cadbury’s overall state of compliance was sound nonetheless through our reviews we determined that in certain jurisdictions including india there appeared to be facts and circumstances warranting further investigation we have undertaken these investigations which are ongoing 

on february 1 2011 we received a subpoena from the sec the subpoena issued in connection with an investigation under the fcpa primarily relates to a cadbury facility in india that we acquired in the cadbury acquisition and primarily requests information regarding dealings with indian governmental agencies and officials to obtain approvals related to the operation of that facility we are cooperating with the us government in its investigation of these matters 

while we cannot predict with certainty the results of these or any other legal matters in which we are currently involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of these matters will have effect on our financial results

 restructuring costs 

within our restructuring programs and initiatives we include certain costs along with exit and disposal costs that are directly attributable to those activities yet they do not qualify for treatment as exit or disposal costs under us gaap these costs which we commonly refer to as other project costs or implementation costs generally include the integration and reorganization of operations and facilities the discontinuance of certain product lines and the incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities management believes the disclosure and inclusion of these charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our programs and initiatives 

integration program 

our combination with cadbury has the potential for meaningful synergies and costs savings we expect to recognize at least 750 million of cost savings by the end of the third year following completion of the acquisition additionally we expect to create revenue synergies from investments in distribution marketing and product development in order to achieve these cost savings and synergies we expect to incur total integration charges of approximately 15 billion in the first three years following the acquisition to combine and integrate the two businesses the “integration program” 

integration program costs include the costs associated with combining our operations with cadbury’s and are separate from the costs related to the acquisition we incurred charges under the integration program of 657 million in 2010 we recorded these charges primarily in operations as a part of selling general and administrative expenses within our kraft foods europe and kraft foods developing markets segments as well as general corporate expenses at december 31 2010 we had an accrual of 406 million related to the integration program 

during the second quarter of 2010 we evaluated cadbury’s vision into action “via” restructuring program and began managing it within our overall integration program cadbury initiated the via restructuring program in 2007 and planned to run it through 2011 accordingly we acquired an accrual of 228 million relating to charges taken in previous periods in evaluating the program as part of our corporate strategies and our integration plans we included the remaining charges within our overall integration program as we move forward on a combined company basis we do not intend to manage these programs separately

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 315 in 2010 288 in 2009 and 282 in 2008 our 2010 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 123 million primarily due to the favorable resolution of a federal tax audit and the resolution of several items in our international operations partially offset by a 137 million writeoff of deferred tax assets as a result of the us health care legislation enacted in march 2010 

our 2009 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 225 million primarily due to an agreement we reached with the irs on specific matters related to years 2000 through 2003 settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the divestiture of our balance bar operations in the us 

  

our 2008 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 222 million from discrete tax events of the total net tax benefits approximately 50 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state federal and foreign tax liabilities and a third quarter reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a writedown of our net deferred tax liabilities the remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions other discrete tax benefits included the impact from divestitures of a nordic and baltic snacks operation and several operations in spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008 in addition the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the us federal statutory tax rate and from the expected tax benefit of 2008 restructuring expenses these benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign tax costs

 net revenues  net revenues increased 10453 million 270 to 49207 million in 2010 and organic net revenues 1 increased 1430 million 37 to 40075 million as follows 

 

   

the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by the cadbury acquisition which added 9143 million in net revenues during the year the increase was partially offset by the impact of divestitures and unfavorable foreign currency due primarily to the impacts of the highly inflationary venezuelan economy and the strength of the us dollar against the euro partially offset by the strength of the canadian dollar brazilian real australian dollar and russian ruble against the us dollar additionally increased organic net revenues were driven by favorable volumemix and higher net pricing favorable volumemix was driven by higher base business shipments across all reportable business segments except us cheese and us grocery higher net pricing was reflected across all reportable business segments except kraft foods europe and us snacks as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs 

operating income  operating income increased 483 million 93 to 5666 million in 2010 due to the following 

 

 input cost increases outpaced pricing during the year higher raw material costs more than offset lower manufacturing costs and higher pricing was driven by the increased input costs we experienced during the year the favorable volumemix was driven primarily by strong contributions from kraft foods developing markets kraft foods europe us beverages and us convenient meals partially offset by declines in us grocery us cheese and us snacks the cadbury acquisition net of integration program and higher acquisitionrelated costs increased operating income by 260 million total selling general and administrative expenses as recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings increased 3217 million from 2009 but excluding the impacts of divestitures foreign currency and our cadbury acquisition including integration program and acquisitionrelated costs decreased 25 million versus the prior year we recognized gains of 67 million in unrealized hedging positions in 2010 versus gains of 203 million in 2009 during 2010 we reversed 37 million in restructuring program charges recorded in prior years versus a reversal of 85 million in restructuring program charges recorded in prior years during 2009 we recorded asset impairment charges of 55 million in 2010 related to intangible assets in china and the netherlands and on a biscuit plant and related property plant and equipment in france versus asset impairment charges of 21 million related to intangible assets in the netherlands and to write off an investment in norway that were recorded in 2009 in addition unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by 8 million due primarily to the impacts of the highly inflationary venezuelan economy and the strength of the us dollar against the euro partially offset by the strength of the canadian dollar brazilian real korean won and australian dollar against the us dollar

net revenues  net revenues decreased 1738 million 43 to 38754 million in 2009 and organic net revenues 1 increased 428 million 11 to 40565 million as follows 

 

 the decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency of 1884 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar against the euro russian ruble ukrainian hryvnia canadian dollar pound sterling brazilian real and polish zloty the impact of divestitures also had an unfavorable impact on net revenues the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by higher organic net revenues the increase in organic net revenues was primarily driven by higher net pricing partially offset by a decrease in volumemix and the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a brazilian value added tax claim 

operating income  operating income increased 1607 million 449 to 5183 million in 2009 due to the following 

 

 higher pricing reflected the carryover impact of 2008 pricing actions as we recovered some of our cumulative cost increases from prior years the favorable volumemix was driven by strong contributions from kraft foods developing markets and us beverages the decrease in input costs was driven by lower raw material costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs during 2009 we reversed 85 million in restructuring program charges recorded in the prior year versus the 989 million in restructuring program charges recognized in 2008 we recognized gains of 203 million on the change in unrealized hedging positions in 2009 versus losses of 205 million in 2008 we recorded 6 million of net losses on divestitures in 2009 versus 92 million of net losses on divestitures in 2008 we recorded asset impairment charges of 21 million related to intangible assets in the netherlands and to write off an investment in norway in 2009 versus asset impairment charges of 140 million related to certain international intangible assets the divestiture of our nordic and baltic snacks operation a juice operation in brazil and a cheese plant in australia that were recorded in 2008 we had 22 million of lower charges from certain legal

as a result of these changes operating income margin also increased from 88 in 2008 to 134 in 2009 

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to kraft foods  net earnings attributable to kraft foods of 3021 million increased by 137 million 48 in 2009 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to kraft foods were 189 in 2009 up 718 from 110 in 2008 diluted eps attributable to kraft foods were 203 in 2009 up 68 from 190 in 2008 due to the following 

 

 results of operations by business segment 

we manage and report operating results through three geographic units kraft foods north america kraft foods europe and kraft foods developing markets we manage the operations of kraft foods north america and kraft foods europe by product category and we manage the operations of kraft foods developing markets by location our reportable segments are us beverages us cheese us convenient meals us grocery us snacks

the following discussion compares our results of operations for each of our reportable segments for 2010 with 2009 and for 2009 with 2008 

 

 as discussed in note 16 segment reporting  management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities which are a component of cost of sales certain components of our us pension plan cost which are a component of cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses general corporate expenses which are a component of selling general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles for all periods presented we exclude the unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results once realized the gains and losses on hedging activities are recorded within segment operating results we exclude certain components of our us pension plan cost from segment operating income because we centrally manage pension plan funding decisions and the determination of discount rate expected rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions therefore we allocate only the service cost component of our us pension plan expense to segment operating income 

in 2010 the change in unrealized gains on hedging activities of 67 million primarily resulted from gains associated with commodity hedging activities in 2009 the change in unrealized gains on hedging activities of 203 million primarily resulted from the 2008 unrealized losses on energy derivatives becoming realized in 2009 and therefore 

  

included in segment operating income in 2008 the change in unrealized losses on hedging activities of 205 million primarily related to energy derivatives including heating oil used primarily to hedge transportation costs and natural gas contracts

kraft foods europe reorganization  the reorganization of our european operations to function on a paneuropean centralized category management and value chain model was completed in 2009 for our chocolate coffee and cheese categories the integration of our european biscuits business was principally completed in the second quarter of 2010 our subsidiary kraft foods europe gmbh acts as the european principal company “epc” the epc manages our european categories centrally and makes decisions for all aspects of the value chain except for sales and distribution our european subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally and the local production companies act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the epc as part of the reorganization we incurred 21 million of severance costs and 69 million of other project costs during 2010 32 million of severance costs and 81 million of other project costs during 2009 and we incurred 16 million of restructuring costs 39 million of implementation costs and 11 million of other nonrecurring costs during 2008 in 2010 and 2009 these charges were recorded within cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses the 2008 restructuring and implementation costs were included in the total restructuring program charges and the other nonrecurring costs were recorded as selling general and administrative expenses management believes the disclosure of other project costs and other nonrecurring costs provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our kraft foods europe reorganization

venezuela  in the fourth quarter of 2009 the venezuelan economy was classified as highly inflationary under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” effective january 1 2010 we began accounting for our venezuelan subsidiaries under highly inflationary accounting rules which principally means all transactions are recorded in us dollars on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and established a preferential exchange rate for imports of food medicine and other essential items accordingly we were required to revalue our net assets in venezuela in july 2010 the venezuelan government eliminated the secondary or parallel market exchange rate and replaced it with the governmentregulated transaction system for foreign currency denominate securities “sitme” rate accordingly we were required to revalue those of our net assets in venezuela that we maintained at the parallel rate then on december 30 2010 the venezuelan government eliminated the preferential exchange rate although the elimination of the preferential exchange rate did not immediately cause us to revalue our net assets in venezuela it will have further impacts to our operating results in future periods venezuela now has two exchange rates the official rate and the sitme rate we used both the official rate and the sitme rate to translate our venezuelan operations into us dollars based on the nature of the operations of each individual subsidiary 

during 2010 we recorded approximately 115 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts relating to highly inflationary accounting in venezuela this included a onetime impact to translate cash of 34 million that we previously carried at the secondary rate upon the change to highly inflationary accounting in january 2010 we were required to translate those us dollars on hand using the official rate based on the current economic structure in venezuela we expect our 2011 operating results will be negatively impacted by approximately another 25 to 50 million as a result of the change to highly inflationary accounting and the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar 

critical accounting policies 

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include kraft foods as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries our domestic operating subsidiaries report results as of the last saturday of the year and our international operating subsidiaries generally report results two weeks prior to the last saturday of the year the results of operations of the newly acquired cadbury are reported on the last day of the calendar month 

in 2010 we changed the consolidation date for certain european biscuits operations which are included within our kraft foods europe segment and certain operations in asia pacific and latin america which are included within our kraft foods developing markets segment previously these operations primarily reported periodend results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period now our kraft foods europe segment primarily reports periodend 

  

results two weeks prior to the last saturday of the period and certain of our operations in asia pacific and latin america report results through the last day of the period we believe the change is preferable and will improve financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our kraft foods europe segment and those operations with asia pacific and latin america with our consolidated reporting this change resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of approximately 200 million and an insignificant impact on operating income and net income in 2010 as the impacts to prior period results were not material to our financial results we have not revised the prior period results for this change our domestic operating subsidiaries will continue to report periodend results as of the saturday closest to the end of each period and our international operating subsidiaries will continue to report periodend results two weeks prior to the saturday closest to the end of each period 

we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence 20  50 ownership interest under the equity method of accounting we use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20 and in which we do not exercise significant influence noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of kraft foods all intercompany transactions are eliminated 

use of estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements significant accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions include among others pension and benefit plan assumptions lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets marketing programs and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which we know the actual amounts historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market we value all our inventories using the average cost method we also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes 

longlived assets 

we review longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of assets held for use we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment we have recognized goodwill in our reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates and estimates of discount rates and residual values if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we must proceed with the second step of the process the second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill to test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned growth rates and estimates of discount rates and royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets as of october 1 each year the basis of our valuation methodology for estimating the fair value of our 21 reporting units is a 20year projection of discounted cash flows that is based on our annual strategic planning process estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans industry and economic conditions for reporting units within our kraft foods north america and kraft foods europe geographic 

  

units we used a marketparticipant weightedaverage cost of capital of 75 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for reporting units within our kraft foods developing markets geographic unit we used a riskrated discount rate of 105 

in 2010 we recorded aggregate asset impairment charges of 55 million or 002 per diluted share during our 2010 review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded a 13 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands and a 30 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in china during the fourth quarter of 2010 we also recorded an asset impairment of 12 million on a biscuit plant and related property plant and equipment in france we recorded the aggregate asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs during our 2010 impairment review we also noted that the following five reporting units were the most sensitive to nearterm changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions 

 

 each of our reporting units passed the first step of our 2010 annual impairment review with an estimated fair value greater than 105 of its carrying value looking past 2010 there are uncertainties within the five identified reporting units that could potentially require further analysis in the future in order for us to determine if a goodwill impairment exists within any of the individual reporting units significant uncertainties are 

 

     

as part of the 2009 annual review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded a 12 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands in addition during 2009 we recorded a 9 million asset impairment charge to write off an investment in norway we recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed the annual review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and recorded a 44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands france and puerto rico in addition in december 2008 we reached a preliminary agreement to divest a juice operation in brazil and reached an agreement to sell a cheese plant in australia in anticipation of divesting the juice operation in brazil we recorded an asset impairment charge of 13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 the charge primarily included the writeoff of associated intangible assets of 8 million and property plant and equipment of 4 million in anticipation of selling the cheese plant in australia we recorded an asset impairment charge of 28 million to property plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2008 additionally in 2008 we divested a nordic and baltic snacks operation and incurred an asset impairment charge of 55 million in connection with the divestiture this charge primarily included the writeoff of associated goodwill of 34 million and property plant and equipment of 16 million we recorded the aggregate charges within asset impairment and exit costs 

insurance and selfinsurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation general liability automobile liability product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers kraft foods’ shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales a provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized 

selling general and administrative expenses 

marketing costs  we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

environmental costs 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable at december 31 2010 our subsidiaries were involved in 74 active actions in the us under superfund legislation and other similar actions and legislation related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

outside the us we are subject to applicable multinational national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business outside the us we have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

as of december 31 2010 we had accrued an insignificant amount for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions 

  

employee benefit plans 

we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits consisting primarily of severance we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries refer to note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 

we recorded the following amounts in earnings for these employee benefit plans during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 the 2010 net expense for employee benefit plans of 951 million increased by 164 million over the 2009 amount the cost increase primarily related to higher pension plan costs including costs associated with the cadbury acquisition and higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences the 2009 net expense for employee benefit plans of 787 million increased by 127 million over the 2008 amount the cost increase primarily related to higher pension plan costs including higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences and settlement losses for the us pension plans 

in 2010 we contributed 85 million to our us pension plans and 303 million to our nonus pension plans in addition employees contributed 23 million to our nonus plans based on current tax law we plan to make contributions of approximately 540 million to our us plans and approximately 400 million to our nonus plans in 2011 of our total 2011 pension contributions approximately 510 million will be voluntary our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors including changes in tax and other benefit laws or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates for our us qualified pension plans we are currently only required to make a nominal cash contribution to our us pension plans under the pension protection act of 2006 in 2011 

we expect our 2011 net expense for employee benefit plans to remain flat primarily due to a weightedaverage decrease of 40 basis points in our us discount rate assumption partially offset by lower forecasted nonus pension plan costs due to plan assumption changes 

we are freezing our us pension plans for current salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective december 31 2019 pension accruals for all salaried and nonunion employees who are currently earning pension benefits will end on december 31 2019 and continuing pay and service will be used to calculate the pension benefits through december 31 2019 our projected benefit obligation decreased 168 million in 2009 and we incurred a 5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze beginning in 2010 our annual us pension plan costs decreased by approximately 40 million as a result of this change additionally for salaried and nonunion hourly employees hired in the us after january 1 2009 we discontinued benefits under our us pension plans and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan this did not have a significant impact on our 2010 or 2009 pension plan cost 

our 2011 health care cost trend rate assumption increased to 750 from 700 for our us postretirement plans and decreased to 883 from 900 for our nonus postretirement plans we established these rates based upon 

  

our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 500 for us plans by 2016 and 600 for nonus plans by 2017 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects as of december 31 2010 

 

 our 2011 discount rate assumption decreased to 530 from 570 for our us postretirement plans and decreased to 502 from 525 for our nonus postretirement plans our 2011 discount rate decreased to 553 from 593 for our us pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations our 2011 discount rate assumption for our nonus pension plans decreased to 511 from 521 we developed the discount rates for our nonus plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2011 expected rate of return on plan assets decreased to 795 from 800 for our us pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2011 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rate or a fiftybasis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease in cost as of december 31 2010 

 

 financial instruments 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management strategies that seek to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates principally through the use of derivative instruments 

financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for hedges of forecasted transactions the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur if we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently 

  

by using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we have exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk we are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments 

we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge to the extent that the hedge is effective are recorded each period in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

we also have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates we use foreigncurrencydenominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates we designated our euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings as a net investment hedge of a portion of our overall european operations the gains and losses on our net investment in these designated european operations are economically offset by losses and gains on our euro and pound sterling denominated borrowings the change in the debt’s fair value is recorded in the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses 

income taxes 

we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when our uncertain tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

commodity trends 

we purchase large quantities of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners in addition we use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

significant cost items in chocolate confectionery products are cocoa and sugar we purchase cocoa and sugar on world markets and the prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the pound sterling and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean cocoa butter and sugar costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009 we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy products are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other 

  

currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2010 than in 2009 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel grain costs on average decreased from 2009 to 2010 

during 2010 our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of higher cocoa sugar dairy coffee and meat costs partially offset by lower grain costs for 2010 our commodity costs were approximately 10 billion higher than 2009 following a decrease of approximately 150 million in 2009 compared to 2008 overall we expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile and to further increase in 2011 

liquidity 

we believe that our cash from operations our existing 45 billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper program and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program and primarily uncommitted international credit lines for regular funding requirements we also use shortterm intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 37 billion in 2010 51 billion in 2009 and 41 billion in 2008 the decrease in operating cash flows in 2010 primarily related to estimated tax payments on the frozen pizza divestiture increased inventory levels and the unfavorable impact of acquisitionrelated financing fees partially offset by increased earnings 

the increase in operating cash flows in 2009 primarily related to working capital improvements over the prior year the capital improvements were primarily due to improved inventory positions partially offset by higher interest payments principally due to the first annual payment on our euro notes additionally higher earnings also attributed to an increase in operating cash flows the increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by higher pension contributions driven by total voluntary contributions of 400 million that we made to our us pension plans in may and december 2009 

we anticipate making us pension contributions of approximately 540 million in 2011 and nonus pension contributions of approximately 400 million in 2011 we expect to fund these contributions from operations 

net cash used in investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 75 billion in 2010 12 billion in 2009 and 13 billion in 2008 the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2010 primarily related to the cadbury acquisition partially offset by higher proceeds from divestitures the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 primarily related to a 99 million payment made to groupe danone sa in 2008 to refund excess cash received in the acquisition of lu biscuit and lower capital expenditures partially offset by lower proceeds from divestitures 

during 2010 we paid 98 billion in net cash for the cadbury acquisition and we received 37 billion in proceeds from the sale of the frozen pizza business and 03 billion in proceeds from the divestitures in poland and romania during 2009 we divested our balance bar operations in the us a juice operation in brazil and a plant in spain and received 41 million in net proceeds during 2008 we received 153 million in net proceeds on divestitures primarily related to a nordic and baltic snacks operation and four operations in spain and we disbursed 56 million for transaction fees related to the splitoff of the post cereals business additionally we paid groupe danone sa the aforementioned refund in 2008 

capital expenditures which were funded by operating activities were 17 billion in 2010 13 billion in 2009 and 14 billion in 2008 cadbury accounted for approximately 440 million of the capital expenditures in 2010 the 2010 capital expenditures were primarily used to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2011 capital expenditures to be approximately 18 billion including capital expenditures required for systems investments and the integration program we expect to fund these expenditures from operations 

  

net cash provided by  used in financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 42 billion in 2010 31 billion used in 2009 and 21 billion used in 2008 the net cash provided by financing activities in 2010 primarily related to proceeds from our longterm debt issuance of 94 billion partially offset by 22 billion in dividends paid 21 billion in longterm debt repayments primarily related to our repurchase of 15 billion in notes through our tender offer and 864 million in net repayments of shortterm borrowings the net cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to 17 billion in dividend payments 950 million in repayments of longterm debt and 344 million in net commercial paper repayments additionally other cash used in financing activities in 2009 included 69 million in costs related to our bridge facility agreement dated november 9 2009 the “cadbury bridge facility” the net cash used in financing activities in 2008 primarily related to 59 billion in payments made on the bridge facility used to fund our lu biscuit acquisition 17 billion in dividend payments 777 million in common stock share repurchases and 795 million in repayments of longterm debt securities primarily related to debt that matured on october 1 2008 partially offset by 69 billion in proceeds from our longterm debt offerings 

in november 2011 11 billion of our longterm debt matures we expect to fund the repayment by refinancing all or a portion of it with longterm debt or shortterm borrowings and any remaining amounts will be funded by cash from operations 

borrowing arrangements 

we maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes including for working capital purposes and to support our commercial paper issuances our 45 billion threeyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility expires in november 2012 no amounts have been drawn on the facility 

the revolving credit facility agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum total shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses of at least 286 billion this threshold was increased by 56 billion to 286 billion due to the equity we issued as part of our cadbury acquisition at december 31 2010 our total shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses was 397 billion we expect to continue to meet this covenant the revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations covenants and events of default however the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security 

in addition to the above some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet shortterm working capital needs collectively these credit lines amounted to 24 billion at december 31 2010 borrowings on these lines amounted to 267 million at december 31 2010 and 191 million at december 31 2009 

cadbury maintained a threeyear £450 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that we terminated in 2010 

as part of our cadbury acquisition on november 9 2009 we entered into the cadbury bridge facility during the first quarter of 2010 we borrowed £807 million under the cadbury bridge facility and later repaid it 1205 million at the time of repayment with proceeds from the divestiture of our frozen pizza business upon repayment the cadbury bridge facility was terminated 

longterm debt

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2010 

 



 

        

equity and dividends 

stock repurchases 

our board of directors had authorized a 50 billion share repurchase program that expired on march 30 2009 we did not repurchase any shares in 2010 or 2009

dividends 

we paid dividends of 2175 million in 2010 1712 million in 2009 and 1663 million in 2008 the increase of 270 in 2010 reflects an increase in shares outstanding due to the cadbury acquisition and the 224 million payment of a ten pence per share dividend that cadbury declared and accrued on the cadbury shares that were outstanding at the time of the acquisition the 29 increase in 2009 reflects a higher dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding resulting from the splitoff of the post cereals business and share repurchases the present annualized dividend rate is 116 per common share the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

2011 outlook

nongaap financial measures 

we use the nonus gaap financial measure “organic net revenues” and corresponding growth ratios the difference between “organic net revenues” and “net revenues” which is the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that organic net revenues excludes the impact of acquisitions divestitures and currency management uses organic net revenues to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have disclosed this measure so that you have the same financial data that management uses with the intention of assisting you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance our management believes that organic net revenues better reflect the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provide improved comparability of results because they exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which are not under our control and also exclude the onetime impacts of acquisitions and divestitures on net revenues the limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on net revenues the best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using organic net revenues in combination with our us gaap reported net revenues our management believes that the presentation of this nonus gaap financial measure when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting kraft foods than could be obtained absent these disclosures because organic net revenues calculations may vary among other companies the organic net revenues figures presented in the consolidated results of operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of organic net revenues is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure you should carefully evaluate the following tables reconciling us gaap reported net revenues to organic net revenues 

 

   

 we use the nonus gaap financial measure “operating eps” and corresponding growth ratios the difference between “operating eps” and “diluted eps attributable to kraft foods from continuing operations” which is the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that operating eps excludes costs related to the integration program acquisitionrelated costs including transaction advisory fees uk stamp taxes and the impact of the cadbury inventory revaluation acquisitionrelated financing fees including hedging and foreign currency impacts associated with the cadbury acquisition and other fees associated with the cadbury bridge facility and the impact of a deferred tax charge resulting from the recently enacted us health care legislation management uses operating eps to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance on a goforward basis and our management believes it provides improved comparability of results because it excludes certain impacts related to the cadbury acquisition and other onetime impacts from earnings per share the limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on diluted eps attributable to kraft foods from continuing operations the best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using operating eps in combination with our us gaap reported diluted eps attributable to kraft foods from continuing operations our management believes that the presentation of this nonus gaap financial measure when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting kraft foods than could be obtained absent these disclosures because operating eps calculations may vary among other companies the operating eps figures presented in the consolidated results of operations section may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies our use of operating eps is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any us gaap financial measure you should carefully evaluate the following tables reconciling us gaap reported diluted eps attributable to kraft foods from continuing operations to operating eps 

 

  

      

in addition we use the nonus gaap financial measure “free cash flow” the difference between “free cash flow” and “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that free cash flow reflects the impact of capital expenditures the limitation of this measure is that it includes items that do not have an impact on our cash flow provided by operating activities the best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using free cash flow in combination with our us gaap reported net cash provided by operating activities 

free cash flow is an internal supplemental measure of our performance our management uses free cash flow as the primary cash flow metric in the budgeting and forecasting processes as it represents the controllable cash flows from operations we believe free cash flow shows the financial health of and how efficiently we are running the company we further believe that this nonus gaap measure provides information useful to both management and investors in gaining an overall understanding of our current financial performance and that it provides investors with financial information that most closely aligns to our internal measurement processes 

this nonus gaap measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows generated by operating investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity because free cash flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with us gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

the table below reconciles reported net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods stated 

 

 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to crosshedge a commodity exposure we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments we included our debt foreign currency forwards and futures swaps and options and commodity futures forwards and options in our var computation anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we used a “variance  covariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2010 and 2009 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

  

as of december 31 2010 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the var model were in millions 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by kraft foods nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors have different profit objectives and some international competitors are less susceptible to currency exchange rates we also compete with generic products and retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price moreover improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

distribution and marketing 

our products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities we currently distribute most products in north america through a combination of direct store delivery and warehouse delivery outside of north america our products are distributed through warehouse delivery and through the services of independent sales offices and agents 

our marketing efforts are conducted through three principal sets of activities i consumer marketing in broadcast print outdoor and online media ii consumer incentives such as coupons and contests and iii trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

raw materials and packaging 

we are a major purchaser of dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel grain costs on average were relatively flat from 2008 to 2009 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008 a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher in 2009 than in 2008 

during 2009 our aggregate commodity costs decreased primarily as a result of lower dairy costs for 2009 our commodity costs were approximately 150 million lower than 2008 following an increase of approximately 20 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 overall we expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile in 2010 

the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

  

intellectual property 

we consider our trademarks in the aggregate to be material to our business we protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the us and in other markets where we sell our products trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in particular locations similarly we sell some of our products under brands we license from third parties including at december 31 2009 

 

     additionally we own numerous patents worldwide while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business we have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of current and potential products including products licensed to others patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country we consider that in the aggregate our patent applications patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations 

we also have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights that are not registered 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs we have approximately 2300 food scientists chemists and engineers working primarily in six key technology centers east hanover new jersey glenview illinois tarrytown new york banbury united kingdom paris france and munich germany these technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and stateoftheart instruments research and development expense was 477 million in 2009 498 million in 2008 and 442 million in 2007 

regulation 

our us food products and packaging materials are primarily regulated by the us food and drug administration or for products containing meat and poultry the us food safety and inspection service of the us department of agriculture these agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing distribution and labeling of food products 

in addition various states regulate our us operations by licensing plants enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants and warehouses regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

many of the food commodities we use in our us operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to periodic us congressional and administrative review 

  

all of our nonus based operations are subject to local and national regulations some of which are similar to those applicable to our us operations for example in the european union we must comply with requirements that apply to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state and local laws in the us and laws and regulations outside of the us relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable in the us the laws and regulations include the clean air act 1990 the clean water act 1972 the resource conservation and recovery act 1976 and superfund the environmental program established to address abandoned hazardous waste sites which imposes joint and severable liability on each responsible party at december 31 2009 our subsidiaries were involved in 71 active actions in the us under superfund legislation and other similar actions related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

outside the us we are subject to applicable multinational national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business outside the us we have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions 

employees 

at december 31 2009 we employed approximately 97000 people worldwide labor unions represent approximately 26 of our 40000 us employees most of the unionized workers at our us locations are represented under contracts with the bakery confectionery tobacco workers and grain millers international union the united food and commercial workers international union and the international brotherhood of teamsters these contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years outside the us labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 60 of our 57000 employees our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business unit in addition in accordance with european union requirements we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

in 2008 we completed our fiveyear restructuring program as part of the program we announced the elimination of approximately 18600 positions as of december 31 2009 we had eliminated approximately 17300 of those positions

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry which may affect our profitability 

the food industry is highly competitive we compete based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences 

from time to time we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain our market share competition and customer pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in 

  

response to commodity and other input cost increases our results of operations will suffer if profit margins decrease as a result of a reduction in prices increased input costs or other factors and if we are unable to increase sales volumes to offset those profit margin decreases 

retailers are increasingly offering retailer brands that compete with some of our products it is important that our products provide higher value and  or quality to our consumers than less expensive alternatives if the difference in value or quality between our products and those of retailer brands narrows or if the perceived difference in quality narrows then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty such as we continue to experience consumers tend to purchase more retailer brands or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or shift our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image or value proposition it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability 

we may also need to increase spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect existing market share or increase market share the success of our investments is subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance as a result our increased expenditures may not maintain or enhance market share and could result in lower profitability 

the consolidation of retail customers the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could affect our operating margins our profitability our net revenues and our results of operations 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the us the european union and our other major markets continue to consolidate these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power these larger retailers capable of operating with reduced inventories can resist price increases and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products in addition they may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own retailer brands the consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us also our retail customers may be affected by recent economic conditions for example they may not have access to funds or financing and that could cause them to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previous purchases 

during 2009 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 27 of our net revenues with our largest customer walmart stores inc accounting for approximately 16 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that all significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past the loss of any one of our significant customers or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and results of operations 

increased price volatility for commodities we purchase may affect our profitability 

we are a major purchaser of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners in addition we use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses price volatility for commodities we purchase has increased due to conditions outside of our control including recent economic conditions currency fluctuations availability of supply weather consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program continued volatility in the prices of commodities we purchase could increase the costs of our products and services and our profitability could suffer 

our product sales depend on our ability to predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and our ability to develop and offer new products rapidly enough to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences 

if we do not succeed in offering products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer we must be able to distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product 

  

categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example recently consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and sodium consumption although we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations we may not be successful in these efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could decrease demand for our products and adversely affect our profitability 

as a multinational corporation our operations are subject to additional risks 

we generated approximately 48 of our 2009 net revenues 49 of our 2008 net revenues and 43 of our 2007 net revenues outside the us the percentage of the combined company’s sales generated outside of the us will increase in 2010 due to the acquisition of cadbury and with the anticipated sale of our frozen pizza business with operations in over 70 countries our operations are subject to risks inherent in multinational operations including 

 

       in addition certain jurisdictions could impose tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our sales moreover our business operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could adversely affect our profitability 

if we are unable to expand our operations in certain emerging markets our growth rate could be negatively affected 

in 2007 we unveiled our strategies to grow our operations with increased focus on emerging markets especially brazil russia china and other regions of southeast asia the success of our operations depends in part on our ability to grow our business in these and other emerging markets in some cases emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions in addition emerging markets are becoming more competitive as other companies grow globally and local low cost manufacturers expand their production capacities if we are unable to increase our business in emerging markets our market share and profitability could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures successfully or integrate acquired businesses successfully 

from time to time we may evaluate acquisition candidates that would strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete acquisitions or integrate successfully and develop these businesses to realize revenue growth and cost savings including recently acquired cadbury our financial results could be adversely affected in addition from time to time we divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets our profitability may be affected by either gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses also we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures which may reduce our profitability finally our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these activities could affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

  

business process improvement initiatives to harmonize our systems and processes may fail to operate as designed and intended 

we regularly implement business process improvement initiatives to harmonize our systems and processes and to optimize our performance our current business process initiatives include but are not limited to our reorganization of our european operations the delivery of a sap enterprise resource planning application and the outsourcing of certain administrative functions if our business process improvement initiatives fail our ability to improve existing operations achieve anticipated cost savings and support future growth could be delayed 

changes in our debt ratings and the effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market could adversely affect our borrowing costs and liquidity 

our debt ratings depend generally on the amount of our debt and our ability to service our debt a downgrade in our debt ratings including as a result of incurring additional debt would and disruptions in the commercial paper market or the effects of other volatile economic conditions on the credit market could reduce the amount of commercial paper that we could issue in addition any of these risks could raise our borrowing costs for both shortterm and longterm debt offerings 

legal claims product recalls or other regulatory enforcement actions could affect our sales reputation and profitability 

as a large food company that operates in a highly regulated highly competitive environment with growing retailer power and a constantly evolving legal and regulatory framework around the world we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our sales reputation and profitability 

further selling products for human consumption involves inherent risks we could be required to recall products due to product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering 

we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a widespread product recall may adversely affect our profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could adversely affect our sales reputation and profitability 

increased regulation could increase our costs and affect our profitability 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies new regulations and changes to existing regulations are issued regularly increased governmental regulation of the food industry such as proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability 

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and have a negative impact on our operating results and profitability 

at the end of 2009 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 106 billion and assets were 89 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can i affect the level of plan funding ii cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and iii increase our future funding requirements in addition if we divest certain businesses we may be required to increase future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic pension cost could increase 

we expect to make approximately 240 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2010 which is approximately 380 million less than we made in 2009 we also expect that our net pension cost will increase by approximately 50 million to approximately 440 million in 2010 as this disclosure was made as of december 31 2009 it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity additionally volatile economic conditions increase the risk that we may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2010

 item 3 legal proceedings

competition authorities in the european union have opened various investigations into possible anticompetitive activity in the fast moving consumer goods “fmcg” sector which includes products such as chocolate and coffee in germany the federal cartel office “fco” is investigating a number of fmcg companies including kraft foods we are cooperating and in contact with the fco at this time we cannot predict with certainty the course or the outcome of these investigations

 cost savings initiatives 

we incurred costs associated with our cost savings initiatives of 318 million in 2009 these charges were recorded in operations primarily within the segment operating income of kraft foods europe with the remainder spread across all other segments the kraft foods europe charges were largely a result of the reorganization of our european operations cost savings initiatives include exit disposal and implementation costs even though implementation costs were directly attributable to exit and disposal costs they did not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities in 2009 our cost savings initiatives primarily included severance charges for benefits received by terminated employees associated benefit plan costs and other related activities 

20042008 restructuring program 

in 2008 we completed our fiveyear restructuring program the “restructuring program” the objectives of this program were to leverage our global scale realign and lower our cost structure and optimize capacity as part of the restructuring program we 

 

    

  in 2009 we reversed 85 million of previously accrued restructuring program charges resulting in a favorable impact to diluted eps of 004 those reversals related to the following 

 

  we incurred charges from continuing operations under the restructuring program of 989 million in 2008 or 045 per diluted share and 447 million in 2007 or 019 per diluted share since the inception of the restructuring program we have paid cash of 17 billion of the 20 billion in expected cash payments including 176 million paid in 2009 at december 31 2009 we had an accrual of 270 million and we had eliminated approximately 17300 positions under the restructuring program 

in 2008 we implemented a new operating structure built on three core elements business units shared services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio and a streamlined corporate staff within the new structure business units now have full pl accountability and are staffed accordingly this also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where we make decisions that affect our consumers and customers our corporate and shared service functions streamlined their organizations to focus on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units the intent was to simplify streamline and increase accountability with the ultimate goal of generating reliable growth for kraft foods in total we eliminated approximately 1400 positions as we streamlined our headquarter functions 

under the restructuring program we recorded asset impairment and exit costs from continuing operations of 884 million in 2008 and 320 million in 2007 we recorded implementation costs from continuing operations of 105 million in 2008 and 127 million in 2007 implementation costs are directly attributable to exit and disposal costs however they do not qualify for treatment as exit or disposal costs under guidance related to accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities these costs primarily include the discontinuance of certain product lines incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities and the reorganization of our european operations discussed below management believes the disclosure of implementation charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our restructuring program refer to note 6 restructuring costs  for details of our restructuring program by segment 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 294 in 2009 290 in 2008 and 302 in 2007 our 2009 effective tax included net tax benefits of 225 million primarily due to an agreement we reached with the irs on specific matters related to years 2000 through 2003 settlements with various foreign and state tax authorities the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions and the divestiture of our balance bar operations in the us 

our 2008 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 222 million from discrete tax events of the total net tax benefits approximately 50 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state federal and foreign tax liabilities and a third quarter reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a writedown of our net deferred tax liabilities the remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions other discrete tax benefits included the impact from divestitures of a nordic and baltic snacks operation and several operations in spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008 in addition the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the us federal statutory tax rate and from the expected tax benefit of 2008 restructuring expenses these benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign tax costs 

  

our 2007 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 184 million primarily including the effects of dividend repatriation benefits foreign joint venture earnings and the effect on foreign deferred taxes from lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2007 the 2007 tax rate also benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the us federal statutory tax rate an increased domestic manufacturing deduction and the divestiture of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks these benefits were partially offset by state tax expense tax costs associated with the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks and interest income from altria related to the transfer of our federal tax contingencies 

as a result of our spinoff from altria group inc “altria” altria transferred our federal tax contingencies to our balance sheet and related interest income of 77 million or 003 per diluted share in 2007 following our spinoff from altria we no longer are a member of the altria consolidated tax return group and we file our own federal consolidated income tax returns

2009 compared with 2008 

   

the decrease in net revenues was partially offset by higher input costdriven pricing the unfavorable volumemix impact on net revenues was driven by volume declines across all reportable segments except us beverages and us convenient meals in part due to the discontinuation of less profitable product lines unfavorable foreign currency decreased net revenues by 1897 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar against the euro russian ruble canadian dollar ukrainian hryvnia british pound brazilian real and polish zloty the absence of the 2008 favorable resolution of a brazilian value added tax claim and the impact of divestitures also had an unfavorable impact on net revenues 

operating income  operating income increased 1681 million 437 to 5524 million in 2009 due to the following in millions 

 

 higher pricing reflected the carryover impact of 2008 pricing actions as we recovered some of our cumulative cost increases from prior years the favorable volumemix was driven by strong contributions from kraft foods developing markets and us convenient meals the decrease in input costs was driven by lower raw material costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs during 2009 we reversed 85 million in restructuring program charges recorded in the prior year versus the 989 million in restructuring program charges recognized in 2008 we recognized gains of 203 million on the change in unrealized hedging positions in 2009 versus losses of 205 million in 2008 we recorded 6 million of net losses on divestitures in 2009 versus 92 million of net losses on divestitures in 2008 we recorded asset impairment charges of 21 million related to intangible assets in the netherlands and to write off an investment in norway in 2009 versus asset impairment charges of 140 million related to certain international intangible assets the divestiture of our nordic and baltic snacks operation a juice operation in brazil and a cheese plant in australia that were recorded in 2008 we had 22 million of lower charges from certain legal matters during 2009 we recorded an additional 50 million of charges for legal matters related to certain of our european operations see part i item 3 legal proceedings for a description of these matters in 2008 we recorded 72 million in charges for legal matters related to certain of our us and european operations including us coffee operations total marketing administration and research costs as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings increased 246 million from 2008 excluding the impacts of divestitures foreign currency charges for certain legal matters and prior year restructuring program costs it increased 694 million over 2008 primarily due to further investments in our brands including spending on cost savings initiatives and higher marketing support costs in addition unfavorable foreign currency decreased operating income by 322 million due primarily to the strength of the us dollar against the british pound euro canadian dollar russian ruble ukrainian hryvnia korean won brazilian real and polish zloty

 higher pricing outpaced our input cost increases during the year as we recovered cumulative cost increases from prior years the increase in input costs was primarily related to higher raw material costs the unfavorable volumemix was driven by declines across most segments within kraft foods north america partially offset by volumemix gains in kraft foods developing markets and kraft foods europe the increase in unrealized losses on hedging activities primarily related to energy derivatives including heating oil used primarily to hedge transportation costs and natural gas contracts our lu biscuit acquisition net of integration costs increased operating income by 360 million total marketing administration and research costs as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings increased 1275 million over the prior year excluding the impacts of acquisitions divestitures foreign currency and

net earnings and earnings per share attributable to kraft foods  net earnings attributable to kraft foods of 2884 million increased by 163 million 60 in 2008 diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to kraft foods were 121 in 2008 down 224 from 156 in 2007 diluted eps attributable to kraft foods were 190 up 118 from 170 in 2007 due to the following 

 

 results of operations by business segment 

we manage and report operating results through three geographic units kraft foods north america kraft foods europe and kraft foods developing markets we manage the operations of kraft foods north america and kraft foods europe by product category and we manage the operations of kraft foods developing markets by location our reportable segments are us beverages us cheese us convenient meals us grocery us snacks canada  na foodservice kraft foods europe formerly known as european union and kraft foods developing markets 

effective january 2009 we began implementing changes to our operating structure based on our organizing for growth initiative and the kraft foods europe reorganization in line with our strategies we are reorganizing our european operations to function on a paneuropean centralized category management and value chain model and we changed how we work in europe in two key ways

kraft foods europe reorganization  the reorganization of our european operations to function on a paneuropean centralized category management and value chain model was completed in 2009 for our chocolate coffee and cheese categories significant progress was made in 2009 related to the integration of our europe biscuits business and we expect the integration to be completed by mid2010 the european principal company “epc” will manage the european categories centrally and make decisions for all aspects of the value chain except for sales and distribution the european subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally and the local production companies will act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the epc the epc legal entity has been incorporated as kraft foods europe gmbh in zurich switzerland as part of the reorganization we incurred 32 million of severance costs 25 million of implementation costs and 56 million of other nonrecurring costs during 2009 we incurred 16 million of restructuring costs 39 million of implementation costs and 11 million of other nonrecurring costs during 2008 and we incurred 21 million of restructuring costs 24 million of implementation costs and 10 million of other nonrecurring costs during 2007 through 2009 we have incurred charges of 241 million related to our kraft foods europe reorganization including the above mentioned costs we expect to incur approximately 40 million in additional charges in 2010 to complete the integration of the europe biscuits business in 2009 these charges were recorded within cost of sales and marketing administration and research costs the 2008 and 2007 restructuring and implementation costs were recorded as part of our overall restructuring program other nonrecurring costs relating to our kraft foods europe reorganization were recorded as marketing administration and research costs management believes the disclosure of implementation and other nonrecurring charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our kraft foods europe reorganization

venezuela  in the fourth quarter of 2009 the venezuelan economy was classified as highly inflationary under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” effective january 1 2010 our venezuelan subsidiary is being accounted for under highly inflationary accounting rules which principally means all transactions are recorded in us dollars venezuela has three exchange rates the official rate the consumer staples rate and the secondary or parallel rate we have historically used and will continue to use the official rate to translate our venezuelan operations however prior to this change in accounting cash that we had exchanged into us dollars using the secondary market was carried at that rate upon the change to highly inflationary accounting we were required to translate our us dollars on hand using the official rate additionally on january 8 2010 the venezuelan government devalued its currency accordingly we were required to revalue our net assets in venezuela and we recorded an insignificant loss which will be reflected in our first quarter 2010 results we expect our 2010 operating results to be negatively impacted by 75 million to 100 million as a result of the aforementioned devaluation this disclosure does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition activity

critical accounting policies 

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include kraft foods as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries our domestic operating subsidiaries report yearend results as of the last saturday of the year and our international operating subsidiaries generally report yearend results two weeks prior to the last saturday of the year 

we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence 20  50 ownership interest under the equity method of accounting we use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20 and in which we do not exercise significant influence noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of kraft foods all intercompany transactions are eliminated 

use of estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements significant accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions include among others pension and benefit plan assumptions lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets marketing programs and income taxes we base our estimates on 

  

historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which we know the actual amounts historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market we record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes effective january 1 2009 we changed our method of valuing our us inventories to the average cost method in prior years principally all us inventories were valued using the lastin firstout “lifo” method we believe that the average cost method of accounting for us inventories is preferable and will improve financial reporting by better matching revenues and expenses to current costs by better aligning our external reporting with our competitors and by aligning our external reporting with our tax basis of accounting the financial statements for all periods presented were conformed to the change in accounting policy with this change we value all of our inventories using the average cost method 

refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of this change in accounting policy 

longlived assets 

we review longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing assets held for use for impairment we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

goodwill and intangible assets 

we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment we have recognized goodwill in our reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates and estimates of discount rates and residual values if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step of the process is necessary the second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill to test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned growth rates and estimates of discount rates and royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value definitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

we perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets as of october 1 each year the basis of our valuation methodology for estimating the fair value of our 20 reporting units is a 20year projection of discounted cash flows that is based on our annual strategic planning process estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans industry and economic conditions for our reporting units within our kraft foods north america and kraft foods europe geographic units we used a marketparticipant weightedaverage cost of capital of 75 to discount the projected cash flows of those operations for our reporting units within our kraft foods developing markets geographic unit we used a riskrated discount rate of 105 

  

as a result of our 2009 annual review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets we recorded a 12 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands during our 2009 impairment review we also noted that the following three reporting units were the most sensitive to nearterm changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions 

 

 each of our reporting units passed the first step of our 2009 annual impairment review with an estimated fair value greater than 110 of its carrying value looking past 2009 there are uncertainties within the three identified reporting units that could potentially require further analysis in the future in order for us to determine if a goodwill impairment exists within any of the individual reporting units significant uncertainties are 

 

    during the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed the annual review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and recorded a 44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands france and puerto rico during our 2008 impairment review we determined that our europe biscuits reporting unit was the most sensitive to nearterm changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions as it contains a significant portion of the goodwill recorded upon our 2007 acquisition of lu biscuit 

insurance and selfinsurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation general liability automobile liability product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers kraft foods’ shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales a provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized 

marketing costs 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred consumer incentive 

  

and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

environmental costs 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when recovery of those costs is deemed probable at december 31 2009 our subsidiaries were involved in 71 active actions in the us under superfund legislation and other similar actions related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions 

employee benefit plans 

in september 2006 new guidance was issued surrounding employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans the new guidance required us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date beginning in 2008 we previously measured our nonus pension plans other than certain canadian and french pension plans at september 30 of each year on december 31 2008 we recorded an aftertax decrease of 8 million to retained earnings using the 15month approach to proportionally allocate the transition adjustment required upon adoption of the measurement provision of the new guidance the plan assets and benefit obligations of our pension plans and the benefit obligations of our postretirement plans are now all measured at yearend 

we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits consisting primarily of severance we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries refer to note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 

we recorded the following amounts in earnings for these employee benefit plans during the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

   

the 2009 net expense for employee benefit plans of 912 million decreased by 308 million over the 2008 amount the cost decrease primarily related to lower postemployment benefit plan costs as we completed our fiveyear restructuring program in 2008 partially offset by higher pension plan costs including a lower expected return on plan assets and higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences the 2008 net expense for employee benefit plans of 1220 million increased by 343 million over the 2007 amount the cost increase primarily related to higher postemployment benefit plan costs related to the restructuring program partially offset by lower pension plan costs including lower amortization of the net loss from experience differences 

we plan to make contributions of approximately 40 million to our us pension plans and approximately 200 million to our nonus pension plans in 2010 our estimated pension contributions do not include anticipated contributions for our newly acquired cadbury business we will update this figure in future filings to reflect these anticipated contributions our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors including changes in tax and other benefit laws or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates for our us qualified pension plans we are not currently required to make any us pension plan contributions under the pension protection act of 2006 in 2010 

we expect our 2010 net expense for employee benefit plans to increase by approximately 40 million the increase is primarily due to higher forecasted nonus pension plan costs due to plan assumption changes partially offset by lower forecasted postemployment benefit plan costs our nonus pension plan costs will be higher primarily due to a weightedaverage decrease of 120 basis points in our discount rate assumption as this disclosure was made as of december 31 2009 it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity 

we will be freezing our us pension plans for current salaried and nonunion hourly employees effective december 31 2019 pension accruals for all salaried and nonunion employees who are currently earning pension benefits will end on december 31 2019 and continuing pay and service will be used to calculate the pension benefits through december 31 2019 our projected benefit obligation decreased 168 million in 2009 and we incurred a 5 million curtailment charge in 2009 related to the freeze we expect the freeze to lower our annual us pension plan costs by approximately 40 million beginning in 2010 additionally for salaried and nonunion hourly employees hired in the us after january 1 2009 we discontinued benefits under our us pension plans and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our 2010 pension plan cost 

our 2010 health care cost trend rate assumption remained unchanged at 700 for our us postretirement plans and remained unchanged at 900 for our canadian postretirement plans we established these rates based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 500 for us plans by 2014 and 600 for canadian plans by 2016 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects as of december 31 2009 

 

 our 2010 discount rate assumption decreased to 570 from 610 for our us postretirement plans and decreased to 525 from 760 for our canadian postretirement plans our 2010 discount rate decreased to 593 from 610 for our us pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations our 2010 discount rate assumption for our nonus pension plans decreased to 521 from 641 we developed the discount rates for our nonus plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2010 expected rate of return on plan assets remained unchanged at 800 for our us pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to 

  

maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments we intend to rebalance our plan portfolios by mid2010 by making contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2010 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rate or a fiftybasis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increase  decrease in cost as of december 31 2009 

 

 financial instruments 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management strategies that seek to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates principally through the use of derivative instruments 

financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for hedges of forecasted transactions the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur if we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently 

by using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and commodity prices we have exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk we are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties in october 2008 one of our counterparties lehman brothers commercial corporation filed for bankruptcy consequently we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them this did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments 

we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge to the extent that the hedge is effective are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses or in earnings gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in 

  

accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

income taxes 

prior to our spinoff from altria we were included in altria’s consolidated federal income tax return we generally computed income taxes on a separate company basis however some of our foreign tax credits capital losses and other credits could not be used on a separate company basis to the extent that altria used our foreign tax credits and other tax benefits in its consolidated federal income tax return we recognized the benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes this benefit was approximately 270 million in 2007 we made payments to or were reimbursed by altria for the tax effects resulting from being included in altria’s tax return as of march 31 2007 we were no longer a member of the altria consolidated tax return group we file our own federal consolidated income tax returns 

in july 2006 new guidance was issued which addressed accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes we adopted the guidance effective january 1 2007 the guidance clarified when tax benefits should be recorded in the financial statements and provided measurement criteria for valuing such benefits in order for us to recognize benefits our tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement before the implementation of this guidance we established additional provisions for certain positions that were likely to be challenged even though we believe that those existing tax positions were fully supportable the adoption of this guidance resulted in an increase to equity as of january 1 2007 of 213 million 

we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

commodity trends 

we are a major purchaser of dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant volatility as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel grain costs on average were relatively flat from 2008 to 2009 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008 a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher in 2009 than in 2008 

during 2009 our aggregate commodity costs decreased primarily as a result of lower dairy costs for 2009 our commodity costs were approximately 150 million lower than 2008 following an increase of approximately 20 billion in 2008 compared to 2007 overall we expect commodity costs to continue to be volatile in 2010 

  

liquidity 

we believe that our cash from operations our existing 45 billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper program and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends we continue to utilize our commercial paper program and primarily uncommitted international credit lines for daily funding requirements we also use shortterm intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility overall we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 51 billion in 2009 41 billion in 2008 and 36 billion in 2007 the increase in operating cash flows in 2009 primarily related to working capital improvements over the prior year primarily due to improved inventory positions partially offset by higher interest payments principally due to the first annual payment on our euro notes and higher earnings the increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by higher pension contributions driven by total voluntary contributions of 400 million that we made to our us pension plans in may and december 2009 

operating cash flows increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increased earnings and working capital improvements mainly from lower income tax payments and lower inventory levels partially offset by increased interest paid the increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by a 305 million tax transfer from altria in 2007 for the federal tax contingencies held by them less the impact of federal reserves reversed due to the adoption of new guidance which addressed accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes the transfer from altria was reflected as a component of the change in other current assets within the net cash provided by operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 

we anticipate making us pension contributions of approximately 40 million in 2010 and nonus pension contributions of approximately 200 million in 2010 we expect to fund these contributions from operations our estimated pension contributions do not include anticipated contributions for our newly acquired cadbury business we will update this figure in future filings to reflect these anticipated contributions 

net cash used in investing activities 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolios and  or expand our geographic reach through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures we are regularly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sell businesses to accelerate the shift in our portfolio toward businesses—whether global regional or local  that offer us a sustainable competitive advantage the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures could have a material impact on our cash flows 

net cash used in investing activities was 12 billion in 2009 13 billion in 2008 and 84 billion in 2007 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2009 primarily related to a 99 million payment made to groupe danone sa in 2008 to refund excess cash received in the acquisition of lu biscuit and lower capital expenditures partially offset by lower proceeds from divestitures the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 primarily related to lower payments for acquisitions partially offset by lower proceeds from divestitures and higher capital expenditures 

during 2009 we divested our balance bar operations in the us a juice operation in brazil and a plant in spain and received 41 million in net proceeds during 2008 we received 153 million in net proceeds on divestitures primarily related to a nordic and baltic snacks operation and four operations in spain and we disbursed 56 million for transaction fees related to the splitoff of the post cereals business additionally we paid groupe danone sa the aforementioned refund in 2008 during 2007 we received net proceeds of 216 million from the divestitures of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks our sugar confectionery assets in romania and related trademarks and our hot cereal assets and trademarks additionally we acquired lu biscuit for € 51 billion approximately 76 billion in cash in 2007 

capital expenditures which were funded by operating activities were 13 billion in 2009 14 billion in 2008 and 12 billion in 2007 the 2009 capital expenditures were primarily used to modernize manufacturing facilities and 

  

support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2010 capital expenditures to be in line with 2009 expenditures including capital expenditures required for systems’ investments we expect to fund these expenditures from operations as this disclosure was made as of december 31 2009 it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity 

net cash used in  provided by financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 31 billion in 2009 and 21 billion during 2008 compared with 51 billion provided during 2007 the net cash used in financing activities in 2009 primarily related to 17 billion in dividend payments 950 million in repayments of longterm debt securities and 344 million in net commercial paper repayments additionally other cash used in financing activities in 2009 included 69 million in costs related to our bridge facility agreement dated november 9 2009 the “cadbury bridge facility” the net cash used in financing activities in 2008 primarily related to 59 billion in payments made on the bridge facility used to fund our lu biscuit acquisition 17 billion in dividend payments 777 million in common stock share repurchases and 795 million in repayments of longterm debt securities primarily related to debt that matured on october 1 2008 partially offset by 69 billion in proceeds from our longterm debt offerings the net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was primarily due to 64 billion in proceeds from longterm debt offerings and net outstanding borrowings of 55 billion under the bridge facility used to fund our lu biscuit acquisition partially offset by 37 billion in common stock share repurchases 16 billion in dividend payments and 14 billion in repayments of longterm debt securities that matured 

in august 2010 500 million of our longterm debt matures we expect to fund the repayment with cash from operations or shortterm borrowings as this disclosure was made as of december 31 2009 it does not reflect the impacts of our recent acquisition and divestiture activity 

borrowing arrangements 

on november 30 2009 we entered into a revolving credit agreement for a 45 billion threeyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the agreement replaced our former revolving credit agreement which was terminated upon the signing of the new agreement we intend to use the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes including for working capital purposes and to support our commercial paper issuances no amounts have been drawn on the facility 

the revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum total shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses of at least 230 billion upon the completion of the cadbury acquisition this covenant will increase by 75 of any increase in our total shareholders’ equity as a direct result of a our issuance of certain types of equity securities to finance the acquisition or b our refinancing certain indebtedness at december 31 2009 our total shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses was 298 billion we expect to continue to meet this covenant the revolving credit agreement also contains customary representations covenants and events of default however the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security 

in addition to the above some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet shortterm working capital needs collectively these credit lines amounted to 15 billion at december 31 2009 borrowings on these lines amounted to 191 million at december 31 2009 and 291 million at december 31 2008 

the cadbury bridge facility is a £55 billion approximately 89 billion 364day senior unsecured facility on january 18 2010 we amended the agreement to increase the cadbury bridge facility to an aggregate of £71 billion on february 11 2010 after the issuance of 95 billion of senior unsecured notes we amended the agreement again to decrease the cadbury bridge facility to an aggregate of £13 billion we expect to use borrowings under the cadbury bridge facility and proceeds from other financing sources to finance the cadbury acquisition and to refinance certain indebtedness of cadbury and its subsidiaries with certain restrictions borrowings under the cadbury bridge facility are also available for our general corporate purposes 

the cadbury bridge facility agreement includes the same minimum shareholders’ equity requirement as in our 45 billion revolving credit agreement in addition in the event that our longterm senior unsecured indebtedness is rated below investment grade by either moody’s or standard  poor’s the cadbury bridge facility agreement requires us to maintain a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of not more than 425 to 100 at december 31 2009 we continued 

  

to maintain our investment grade debt rating and our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was 264 the cadbury bridge facility agreement also contains customary representations covenants and events of default and requires the prepayment of advances and  or the permanent reduction of commitments under the facility with the net cash proceeds received from certain disposals debt issuances and equity capital markets transactions no amounts were drawn on the facility at december 31 2009 

subject to market conditions we expect to refinance or reduce advances under the cadbury bridge facility from proceeds of alternative financing sources 

debt 

our total debt was 190 billion at december 31 2009 and 203 billion at december 31 2008 our debttocapitalization ratio was 042 at december 31 2009 and 048 at december 31 2008 at december 31 2009 the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 84 years 

on february 8 2010 we issued 95 billion of senior unsecured notes at a weightedaverage effective rate of 5364 and are using the net proceeds 9379 million to finance the cadbury acquisition and for general corporate purposes after the issuance of the 95 billion of senior unsecured notes the weightedaverage term of our outstanding longterm debt was 105 years 

on september 3 2009 we redeemed our november 2011 7 200 million debenture at par value upon redemption we recorded a loss of 14 million within interest and other expense net which represented the writeoff of the remaining discount on november 12 2009 we repaid 750 million in notes and on october 1 2008 we repaid 700 million in notes these repayments were primarily financed from commercial paper issuances 

on december 19 2008 we issued 500 million of senior unsecured notes on may 22 2008 we issued 20 billion of senior unsecured notes and on march 20 2008 we issued € 285 billion approximately 45 billion of senior unsecured notes we used the net proceeds from these issuances 498 million in december 1967 million in may and approximately 4470 million in march for general corporate purposes including the repayment of borrowings under the bridge facility used to fund our lu biscuit acquisition and other shortterm borrowings 

the notes from all above issuances include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens above a certain threshold we are also required to offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase if we experience both of the following 

 

  we expect to continue to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  for further details of these debt offerings 

from time to time we refinance longterm and shortterm debt the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors we have an automatic shelf registration on form s3 on file with the sec as a wellknown seasoned issuer we are able to register new debt securities in amounts authorized by our board of directors through december 2010 on october 4 2007 our board of directors authorized 50 billion in general longterm financing which was in addition to the € 53 billion authorized for the lu biscuit acquisition and the £71 billion authorized for the cadbury acquisition at december 31 2009 we had approximately 30 billion remaining in general longterm financing authority and £71 billion approximately 115 billion remaining in cadbury financing authority from our board of directors

stock repurchases 

our board of directors authorized the following common stock repurchase programs our 50 billion share repurchase authority expired on march 30 2009 we did not repurchase any shares in 2009 

 

 in total we repurchased 253 million shares for 777 million in 2008 and 1101 million shares for 3640 million in 2007 under these programs we made these repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions 

in march 2007 we repurchased 14 million additional shares of our common stock from altria at a cost of 465 million we paid 32085 per share which was the average of the high and the low price of kraft foods common stock as reported on the nyse on march 1 2007 this repurchase was in accordance with our spinoff agreement with altria 

stock plans 

at our 2009 annual meeting our shareholders approved the kraft foods inc amended and restated 2005 performance incentive plan the “2005 plan” the 2005 plan includes among other provisions a limit on the number of shares that may be granted vesting restrictions and a prohibition on stock option repricing under the amended plan we are authorized to issue a maximum of 1680 million shares of our common stock as of the effective date of the amendment there were 921 million shares available to be granted under the 2005 plan of which no more than 275 million shares may be awarded as restricted or deferred stock 

in 2008 we changed our annual and longterm incentive compensation programs to further align them with shareholder returns under the annual equity program we now grant equity in the form of both restricted or deferred stock and stock options the restricted or deferred stock continues to vest 100 after three years and the stock 

  

options vest in three annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date additionally we changed our longterm incentive plan from a cashbased program to a sharebased program these shares vest based on varying performance market and service conditions the unvested longterm incentive plan shares have no voting rights and do not pay dividends 

in january 2009 we granted 15 million shares of stock in connection with our longterm incentive plan the market value per share was 2700 on the date of grant in february 2009 as part of our annual equity program we issued 41 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees the market value per restricted or deferred share was 2364 on the date of grant also as part of our annual equity program we granted 163 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price of 2364 

we also issued 02 million offcycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2009 the weightedaverage market value per restricted or deferred share was 2555 on the date of grant in aggregate we issued 58 million restricted and deferred shares during 2009 

at december 31 2009 the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options vesting of nonus deferred shares and vesting of longterm incentive plan shares was 528 million or 36 of total shares outstanding 

in january 2008 we granted 14 million shares of stock in connection with our longterm incentive plan the market value per share was 3226 on the date of grant in february 2008 as part of our annual equity program we issued 34 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees the market value per restricted or deferred share was 2949 on the date of grant also as part of our annual equity program we granted 135 million stock options to eligible employees at an exercise price of 2949 

in addition we issued 02 million offcycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2008 the weightedaverage market value per restricted or deferred share was 3038 on the date of grant in aggregate we issued 50 million restricted and deferred shares during 2008 we also granted 01 million offcycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of 3078 in aggregate we granted 136 million stock options during 2008 

our board of directors approved a stock option grant to our chief executive officer on may 3 2007 to recognize her election as our chairman she received 300000 stock options which vest under varying market and service conditions and expire ten years after the grant date 

in january 2007 we issued 52 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible employees as part of our annual equity program the market value per restricted or deferred share was 34655 on the date of grant additionally we issued 10 million offcycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2007 the weightedaverage market value per restricted or deferred share was 34085 on the date of grant the total number of restricted and deferred shares issued in 2007 was 92 million including those issued as a result of our spinoff from altria discussed below 

upon our spinoff altria stock awards were modified through the issuance of kraft foods stock awards and accordingly the altria stock awards were split into two instruments holders of altria stock options received 1 a new kraft foods option to acquire shares of kraft foods common stock and 2 an adjusted altria stock option for the same number of shares of altria common stock previously held but with a proportionally reduced exercise price for each employee stock option outstanding the aggregate intrinsic value immediately after our spinoff from altria was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to it holders of altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded before january 31 2007 retained their existing awards and received restricted stock or stock rights in kraft foods common stock recipients of altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded on or after january 31 2007 did not receive kraft foods restricted stock or stock rights because altria had announced the spinoff at that time we reimbursed altria 179 million for net settlement of the employee stock awards we determined the fair value of the stock options using the blackscholes option valuation model and adjusted the fair value of the restricted stock and stock rights by the value of projected forfeitures 

based upon the number of altria stock awards outstanding at the time of our spinoff we granted stock options for 242 million shares of common stock at a weightedaverage price of 1575 the options expire between 2007 and 

  

2012 in addition we issued 30 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights the market value per restricted share or right was 3166 on the date of grant restrictions on the majority of these restricted shares and stock rights lapsed in either the first quarter of 2008 or 2009 

dividends 

we paid dividends of 1712 million in 2009 1663 million in 2008 and 1638 million in 2007 the increases of 29 in 2009 and 15 in 2008 reflect higher dividend rates partially offset by fewer shares outstanding resulting from the splitoff of the post cereals business and share repurchases the present annualized dividend rate is 116 per common share the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

2010 outlook 

we expect the strong operating and financial momentum of our base business to carry forward into coming years in the near term we continue to target organic net revenue growth of 4 percent or more and the high end of our 7 to 9 percent longterm eps growth objective on our base business 

we expect to deliver this performance while 

 

    in addition our consolidated results will include cadbury from february 2 2010 onwards the combination of kraft foods and cadbury is expected to provide the potential for meaningful revenue synergies over time from investments in distribution marketing and product development as a result the combined company is targeting longterm organic net revenue growth of 5 percent or more 

opportunities for significant synergies from the combination have also been identified on a combined basis we continue to expect that pretax cost savings of at least 675 million annually can be realized by the end of 2012 total onetime implementation cash costs of approximately 13 billion are expected to be incurred through the end of 2012 

on a combined basis we are targeting accretion to earnings per share in 2011 of approximately 005 on a cash basis which excludes onetime expenses to achieve cost savings expenses related to the transaction and the impact of incremental noncash items such as the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition over the longterm the combined company is targeting eps growth of 9 to 11 percent 

our results will also be affected by the sale of the assets of our frozen pizza business which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010 we also expect earnings to be reduced by approximately 005 per diluted share on an annual basis as a result of the frozen pizza business transaction this assumes the proceeds will be used for a combination of debt reduction and share repurchases

nongaap financial measures 

we use the nonus gaap financial measure “organic net revenues” and corresponding growth ratios the difference between “organic net revenues” and “net revenues” which is the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that organic net revenues excludes the impact of acquisitions divestitures and currency organic net revenues is used by our management to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance we have disclosed this measure so that you have the same financial data that management uses with the intention of assisting you in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing our underlying performance our management believes that organic net revenues better reflect the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provide improved comparability of results because they exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which are not under our control and also exclude the onetime impacts of acquisitions and divestitures on net revenues the limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on net revenues the best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using organic net revenues in combination with our us gaap reported net revenues our management believes that the presentation of this nonus gaap financial measure when considered together with our us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding us gaap financial measures provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting kraft foods than could be obtained absent these disclosures because organic net revenues calculations may vary among other companies the organic net revenues figures presented in the consolidated results of operations section may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies organic net revenues are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for us gaap financial measures you should carefully evaluate the following table reconciling us gaap reported net revenues to organic net revenues 

 

 in addition we use the nonus gaap financial measure “free cash flow” the difference between “free cash flow” and “net cash provided by operating activities” which is the most comparable us gaap financial measure is that free cash flow reflects the impact of capital expenditures the limitation of this measure is that it includes items that do not have an impact on our cash flow provided by operating activities the best way that this limitation can be addressed is by using free cash flow in combination with our us gaap reported net cash provided by operating activities 

free cash flow is an internal supplemental measure of our performance our management uses free cash flow as the primary cash flow metric in the budgeting and forecasting processes as it represents the controllable cash flows from operations we believe free cash flow shows the financial health of and how efficiently we are running the company we further believe that this nonus gaap measure provides information useful to both management and investors in gaining an overall understanding of our current financial performance and that it provides investors with financial information that most closely aligns to our internal measurement processes 

this nonus gaap measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows generated by operating investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity because free cash flow is not a measurement determined in accordance with us gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 

  

the table below reconciles reported net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods stated

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

as we operate globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to crosshedge a commodity exposure we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency commodity price and interest rate risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures 

in october 2008 one of our counterparties lehman brothers commercial corporation filed for bankruptcy consequently we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them this did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments we included our debt shortterm investments foreign currency forwards swaps and options and commodity futures forwards and options in our var computation anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we used a “variance  covariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2009 and 2008 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

  

as of december 31 2009 the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the var model were in millions 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by kraft foods nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

significant acquisitions and divestitures 

lu biscuit acquisition 

on november 30 2007 we acquired the global lu biscuit business of groupe danone sa “ lu biscuit” for €51 billion approximately 76 billion in cash the acquisition included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14000 employees we acquired net assets consisting primarily of goodwill of 4052 million which will not be deductible for statutory tax purposes intangible assets of 3546 million substantially all of which are indefinitelived receivables of 757 million property plant and equipment of 1054 million and inventories of 204 million and assumed liabilities of 1063 million consisting primarily of accounts payable and accruals these purchase price allocations were based upon appraisals that were 

  

finalized in the third quarter of 2008 lu biscuit contributed net revenues of 32 billion during 2008 and 28 billion on a proforma basis during 2007 lu biscuit reported results from operations on a one month lag in 2007 as such there was no impact on our operating results on a proforma basis lu biscuit’s net earnings for the year ended december 31 2007 would have been insignificant to kraft 

post cereals splitoff 

on august 4 2008 we completed the splitoff of the post cereals business into ralcorp holdings inc “ralcorp” after an exchange with our shareholders the exchange is expected to be taxfree to participating shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

in this splitoff transaction approximately 461 million shares of kraft common stock were tendered for 1644 million our shareholders had the option to exchange some or all of their shares of kraft common stock and receive shares of common stock of cable holdco inc “cable holdco” cable holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the post cereals business in exchange for the contribution of the post cereals business cable holdco issued approximately 665 million in debt securities issued shares of its common stock and assumed a 300 million credit facility following the merger of cable holdco and a ralcorp subsidiary the cable holdco common stock was exchanged for shares of ralcorp common stock on a oneforone basis upon closing we used the cash equivalent net proceeds approximately 960 million to repay debt as a result of the splitoff we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of 937 million or 062 per diluted share in 2008 the results of the post cereals business were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings and prior period results were restated in a consistent manner 

see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions 

customers 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 27 of our net revenues in 2008 29 in 2007 and 28 in 2006 our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 36 of our net revenues in 2008 40 in 2007 and 38 in 2006 one of our customers walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 16 of our net revenues in 2008 15 in 2007 and 14 in 2006 

seasonality 

demand for some of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events however sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our diversified product portfolio 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors may have different profit objectives and some international competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates we also compete with generic products and retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price moreover improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

distribution 

our products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities we currently distribute most products in north america through a combination of directstoredelivery and warehouse delivery kraft international’s products are distributed through warehouse delivery and through the services of independent sales offices and agents we support our selling efforts through three principal sets of activities consumer advertising in broadcast print outdoor and online media consumer incentives such as coupons and contests and trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers 

  

raw materials 

we are a major purchaser of dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant increases as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel grain costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 

during 2008 our aggregate commodity costs rose significantly as a result of higher dairy coffee cocoa wheat nuts meat products soybean oil and packaging costs for 2008 our commodity costs were approximately 18 billion higher than 2007 following an increase of approximately 13 billion for 2007 compared with 2006 overall we expect commodity costs to moderately increase in 2009 

the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

intellectual property 

we consider our trademarks in the aggregate to be material to our business we protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the us and in other markets where we sell our products trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in particular locations similarly we sell some of our products under brands we license from third parties these licensed brands include among others 

 

      additionally we own numerous patents worldwide while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business we have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of current and potential products including products licensed to others patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual 

  

protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country we consider that in the aggregate our patent applications patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations 

we also have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights that are not registered 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs we have approximately 2400 food scientists chemists and engineers working primarily in six key technology centers east hanover new jersey glenview illinois tarrytown new york banbury united kingdom paris france and munich germany these technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and stateoftheart instruments research and development expense was 499 million in 2008 442 million in 2007 and 414 million in 2006 

regulation 

our us food products and packaging materials are regulated by the food and drug administration or for products containing meat and poultry the food safety and inspection service of the us department of agriculture these agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing distribution and labeling of food products 

in addition various states regulate our us operations by licensing plants enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants and warehouses regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

many of the food commodities we use in our us operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 

all of our nonus based operations are subject to local and national regulations some of which are similar to those applicable to our us operations for example in the eu requirements apply to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable in the us the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and superfund which imposes joint and severable liability on each responsible party as of december 31 2008 our subsidiaries were involved in 67 active superfund and other similar actions in the us related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

outside the us we are subject to applicable multinational national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business we have specific programs across our international business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions 

employees 

at december 31 2008 we employed approximately 98000 people worldwide labor unions represent approximately 43 of our 39000 us employees most of the unionized workers at our domestic locations are represented under contracts with the bakery confectionery tobacco workers and grain millers international union the united food and commercial workers 

  

international union and the international brotherhood of teamsters these contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years outside the us labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 72 of our 59000 employees our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each enterprise in addition in accordance with eu requirements we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

in 2008 we completed our fiveyear restructuring program the “restructuring program” in connection with our severance initiatives as of december 31 2008 we had eliminated approximately 15200 positions and we had announced our intent to eliminate an additional 3800 positions

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry which may affect our profitability 

the food industry is intensely competitive we compete based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain our market share competition and customer pressures however also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other input cost increases our results of operations will suffer if profit margins decrease as a result of either a reduction in prices or increased input costs and if we are unable to increase sales volumes to offset those profit margin decreases 

we may also need to increase spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect existing market share or capture increased market share the success of our investments is subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance as a result our increased expenditures may not maintain or enhance market share and could result in lower profitability 

our brands may be challenged to compete against lowerpriced private label products particularly in times of economic downturns 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with some of our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products provide higher value and  or quality to our customers than less expensive alternatives if the difference in value or quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty such as we are currently experiencing consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image or value proposition it could have a material effect on our market share and our profitability 

the consolidation of retail customers the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could affect our operating margins our profitability our sales and our results of operations 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in the us the eu and our other major markets continue to consolidate these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power these larger retailers capable of operating with reduced inventories can resist price increases and demand lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products they also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products the consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on us also our retail customers may be affected by the current economic environment for example they may not have access to funds or financing and that could cause them to delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or to not pay us or to delay paying us for previous purchases 

a few of our customers are material to our business and operations our largest customer walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 16 of our net revenues during 2008 during 2008 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 27 of our net revenues there can be no assurance that all significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities that they have in the past the loss of any one of our significant customers or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

increased price volatility for commodities we purchase may affect our profitability 

we are a major purchaser of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses price volatility for commodities we purchase has increased due to conditions outside of our control including the current economic environment currency fluctuations 

  

availability of supply weather consumer demand and changes in governmental agricultural programs although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program continued volatility in the prices of commodities we purchase could increase the costs of our products and services and our profitability could suffer 

our product sales depend on our ability to predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and our ability to develop and offer new products rapidly enough to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food products change continually for example recently consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy as a result over the last several years our products have been subject to scrutiny relating to the health implications of obesity and transfatty acids our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences we have been and will continue to be affected by publicity concerning the health implications of our products some of which could negatively influence consumer perception and acceptance of our products and marketing programs 

furthermore if we do not succeed in offering products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer we must be able to distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to successfully expand our product offerings across a multitude of product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

our international operations are subject to additional risks 

we generated approximately 49 of our 2008 sales 43 of our 2007 sales and 40 of our 2006 sales in foreign countries our international operations are subject to inherent risks including fluctuations in currency values unpredictability of foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies unexpected changes in local regulations and laws and the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions in addition foreign jurisdictions could impose tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions on our international sales moreover our international business operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes terrorist activity political unrest and other economic or political uncertainties all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could adversely affect our profitability 

if we are unable to expand our operations in certain emerging markets our growth rate could be negatively affected 

in 2007 we unveiled our strategies to grow our international operations with increased focus on four emerging markets brazil russia china and other regions of southeast asia the success of our international operations depends in part on our ability to grow our business in these and other emerging markets in some cases emerging markets have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions in addition emerging markets are becoming more competitive as other international companies grow globally and local low cost manufacturers expand their production capacities if we are unable to increase our business in emerging markets our market share and profitability could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to successfully consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that would strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete successfully integrate and develop these acquisition candidates to realize revenue growth and cost savings our financial results could be adversely affected in addition from time to time we divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets our profitability may be affected by either gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses also we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures which may reduce our profitability finally our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these activities could affect our product sales financial conditions and results of operations 

  

business process improvement initiatives to simplify and harmonize our business processes may fail to operate as designed and intended 

we regularly implement business process improvement initiatives to simplify and harmonize our systems processes and to optimize our performance our current business process initiatives include but are not limited to the kraft europe reorganization the delivery of an sap enterprise resource planning application and the outsourcing of certain administrative functions if our business process improvement initiatives fail our ability to improve existing operations and support future growth could be delayed 

product recalls injuries caused by products or other legal claims could affect our sales reputation and profitability 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal risks we could be required to recall products due to product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our advertising could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us or a widespread product recall may adversely affect our profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and profitability 

we operate in a highly regulated environment 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies new regulations and changes to existing regulations are issued regularly increased governmental regulation of the food industry such as proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability 

the effects of the present economic environment on the credit markets and changes in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity 

our 45 billion revolving credit facility supports our commercial paper issuances we use our commercial paper program in addition to international credit lines for daily funding requirements the present economic environment in general has restricted access to the credit markets if the present economic environment worsens our access to commercial paper our ability to refinance our credit facility by the time it expires in april 2010 and our ability to secure additional long or shortterm financing on terms and within a time period acceptable to us could negatively affect our liquidity in addition a downgrade in our credit ratings would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue and it could raise our borrowing costs for both shortterm and longterm debt offerings 

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and have a negative impact on our operating results and profitability 

at the end of 2008 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 93 billion and assets were 70 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can i affect the level of plan funding ii cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and iii increase our future funding requirements in addition if we divest certain businesses we may be required to increase future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic pension cost could increase 

we expect to make approximately 390 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2009 which is approximately 170 million more than we made in 2008 we also expect that our net pension cost will increase by approximately 200 million to approximately 440 million in 2009 the current economic environment increases the risk that we may be required to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans and recognize further increases in our net pension cost beyond 2009

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we are defendants in a variety of legal proceedings plaintiffs in a few of those cases seek substantial damages we cannot predict with certainty the results of these proceedings however we believe that the final outcome of these proceedings will not materially affect our financial results 

kraft has been involved in litigation with the procter  gamble company “pg” concerning three patents related to roast and ground coffee and the packaging for that coffee during the course of that litigation pg sold its coffee business to the j m smucker company which now owns the folgers coffee company “folgers” on january 16 2009 we settled the litigation relating to all of those patents and as part of that settlement agreed to arbitrate with folgers the claim relating to us patent number 5721005 related to roast ground and flaked coffee products that have been fastroasted we do not believe that an adverse finding in this arbitration would materially affect our financial results

discussion and analysis 

growth strategy 

at the consumer analyst group of new york “cagny” conference in february 2009 we presented the progress we made in 2008 on our longterm growth strategy and our plans for year three of our plan to return kraft to reliable growth our four growth strategies and 2008 developments are summarized below 

build a high performing organization – we have done a lot over the past two years to rewire kraft and create a high performance culture we have strengthened our senior leadership team and leveraged our business unit structure we will continue to raise the bar on talent through internal development and external hiring with the goal of organizational diversity at all levels effective january 2009 we are reorganizing kraft europe to better maximize our potential there and we already integrated the legacy kraft and lu biscuit operations within key markets in our developing markets segment we are further building scale in developing markets by using business models relevant in individual geographies and countries 

reframe our categories – we continue to reframe our categories in order to make them more relevant and contemporary with our consumers we are utilizing our “growth diamond” to contemporize our base business specifically to identify health and wellness trajectorychanging ideas and skew our resources toward those categories countries and brands that have the highest potential for return furthermore we strengthened our category mix through various acquisitions divestitures and product pruning over the last few years 

exploit our sales capabilities – we will continue to use our large scale as a competitive advantage and better leverage our portfolio through superior execution our “walltowall” initiative for kraft north america combined the executional benefits of directstoredelivery used in our biscuit business unit with the economics of our warehouse delivery to drive faster growth we are expanding upon that idea with “high visibility walltowall” in large high turnover stores and geographies 

drive down costs without compromising quality – we have found new ways to drive sustainable cost savings while continuing to invest in the quality of our core brands despite significant increases in product costs we will continue to leverage quality as a growth driver by increasing the percentage of products rated superior and preferred we plan to improve gross margins with our new operating structure in europe and with the implementation of sap as our core system in north america and europe 

items affecting comparability of financial results 

acquisitions and divestitures 

lu biscuit acquisition 

on november 30 2007 we acquired the global lu biscuit business of groupe danone sa “ lu biscuit” for €51 billion approximately 76 billion in cash the acquisition included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14000 employees we acquired net assets consisting primarily of goodwill of 4052 million which will not be deductible for statutory tax purposes intangible assets of 3546 million substantially all of which are indefinitelived receivables of 757 million property plant and equipment of 1054 million and inventories of 204 million and assumed liabilities of 1063 million consisting primarily of accounts payable and accruals these purchase price allocations were based upon appraisals that were finalized in the third quarter of 2008 we used borrowings of €51 billion to finance this acquisition interest incurred on these borrowings was the primary driver of the 533 million increase in interest expense during 2008 lu biscuit contributed net revenues of 32 billion during 2008 and 28 billion on a proforma basis during 2007 lu biscuit reported results from operations on a one month lag in 2007 as such there was no impact on our operating results on a proforma basis lu biscuit’s net earnings for the year ended december 31 2007 would have been insignificant to kraft 

united biscuits acquisition 

in 2006 we acquired the spanish and portuguese operations of united biscuits “ub” for approximately 11 billion the noncash acquisition was financed by our assumption of 541 million of debt issued by the acquired business immediately prior to the acquisition as well as 530 million of value for the redemption of our outstanding investment in ub primarily deepdiscount securities the redemption of our outstanding investment resulted in a gain on closing of 251 million or 009 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006 

post cereals splitoff 

on august 4 2008 we completed the splitoff of the post cereals business into ralcorp holdings inc “ralcorp” after an exchange with our shareholders the exchange is expected to be taxfree to participating shareholders for us federal income tax purposes 

  

in this splitoff transaction approximately 461 million shares of kraft common stock were tendered for 1644 million our shareholders had the option to exchange some or all of their shares of kraft common stock and receive shares of common stock of cable holdco inc “cable holdco” cable holdco was our wholly owned subsidiary that owned certain assets and liabilities of the post cereals business in exchange for the contribution of the post cereals business cable holdco issued approximately 665 million in debt securities issued shares of its common stock and assumed a 300 million credit facility upon closing we used the cash equivalent net proceeds approximately 960 million to repay debt as a result of the splitoff we recorded a gain on discontinued operations of 937 million or 062 per diluted share in 2008 

on june 25 2008 cable holdco filed a registration statement on form s1s4a with the sec that announced the start of the exchange offer approximately 305 million shares of cable holdco were offered in exchange for kraft common stock at an exchange ratio of 06606 the exchange ratio was calculated using the daily volumeweighted average prices of kraft common stock and ralcorp common stock on the nyse on the last three trading days of the offer which expired on august 4 2008 the exchange offer was oversubscribed and as a result the number of shares of kraft common stock accepted for exchange in the offer was prorated following the merger of cable holdco and a ralcorp subsidiary the cable holdco common stock was exchanged for shares of ralcorp common stock on a oneforone basis 

the post cereals business included such cereals as honey bunches of oats  pebbles  shredded wheat  selects  grapenuts and honeycomb  under kraft the brands in this transaction were distributed primarily in north america in addition to the post brands the transaction included four manufacturing facilities certain manufacturing equipment and approximately 1230 employees who joined ralcorp as part of the transaction 

the results of the post cereals business were reflected as discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of earnings and prior period results were restated in a consistent manner pursuant to the post cereals business transition services agreement we agreed to provide certain sales comanufacturing distribution information technology and accounting and finance services to ralcorp for up to 12 months with ralcorp’s option to extend it for an additional 6 months 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we increased our gain on discontinued operations by 77 million to correct for a deferred tax liability that should have been writtenoff upon the splitoff of the post cereals business as such our gain from the splitoff of the post cereals business was 937 million

refer to note 6 asset impairment exit and implementation costs  for details of all asset impairment charges by segment the net impacts to segment operating income from losses  gains on divestitures and the corresponding asset impairment charges are summarized in the table below 

 

  restructuring program 

in 2008 we completed our fiveyear restructuring program the “restructuring program” the objectives of this program were to leverage our global scale realign and lower our cost structure and optimize capacity as part of the restructuring program we 

 

    in 2008 we implemented a new operating structure built on three core elements business units shared services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio and a streamlined corporate staff within the new structure business units now have full pl accountability and are staffed accordingly this also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where we make decisions that affect our consumers and customers our corporate and shared service functions continue to streamline their organizations and focus on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units the intent is to simplify streamline and increase accountability with the ultimate goal of generating reliable growth for kraft in total we will eliminate approximately 1500 positions as we streamline our headquarter functions 

we incurred charges under the restructuring program from continuing operations of 989 million in 2008 or 045 per diluted share 447 million in 2007 or 019 per diluted share and 670 million in 2006 or 027 per diluted share since the inception of the restructuring program we have paid cash for 15 billion of the 31 billion in charges at december 31 2008 we had 489 million accrued in restructuring program costs as part of the restructuring program we announced the closure of six plants during 2008 in connection with our severance initiatives as of december 31 2008 we had eliminated approximately 15200 positions and we had announced our intent to eliminate an additional 3800 positions 

under the restructuring program we recorded asset impairment and exit costs from continuing operations of 884 million during 2008 320 million during 2007 and 575 million during 2006 we recorded implementation costs from continuing operations of 105 million in 2008 127 million in 2007 and 95 million in 2006 implementation costs are directly attributable to exit costs however they do not qualify for treatment under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  these costs primarily include the discontinuance of certain product lines incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities the electronic data systems “eds” transition and the reorganization of our european operations discussed below management believes the disclosure of implementation charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our restructuring program 

  

in addition we made 498 million in capital expenditures to implement the restructuring program including 111 million spent in 2008 incremental cost savings totaled approximately 283 million in 2008 resulting in cumulative annualized savings under the restructuring program of approximately 1066 million by the end of 2008 cumulative annualized cost savings resulting from the restructuring program were approximately 783 million by the end of 2007 refer to note 6 asset impairment exit and implementation costs  for details of our restructuring program by segment 

kraft europe reorganization 

we are also in the process of reorganizing our european operations to function on a paneuropean centralized category management and value chain model after the reorganization is complete the european principal company “epc” will manage the european categories centrally and make decisions for all aspects of the value chain except for sales and distribution the european subsidiaries will execute sales and distribution locally and the local production companies will act as toll manufacturers on behalf of the epc the epc legal entity has been incorporated as kraft foods europe gmbh in zurich switzerland as part of the reorganization we incurred 16 million of restructuring costs 39 million of implementation costs and 11 million of nonrecurring costs during 2008 21 million of restructuring costs 24 million of implementation costs and 10 million of other nonrecurring costs during 2007 and 7 million of restructuring costs during 2006 restructuring and implementation costs are recorded as part of our overall restructuring program other costs relating to our kraft europe reorganization are recorded as marketing administration and research costs management believes the disclosure of implementation and other nonrecurring charges provides readers of our financial statements greater transparency to the total costs of our kraft europe reorganization 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 282 in 2008 298 in 2007 and 224 in 2006 our effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 242 million from discrete tax events in 2008 of the total net tax benefits 29 million related to a reconciliation of our inventory of deferred tax items that resulted in a writedown of our net deferred tax liabilities in the third quarter and 42 million related to fourth quarter corrections of state federal and foreign tax liabilities the remaining net tax benefits primarily related to the resolution of various tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions other discrete tax benefits included the impact from divestitures of a nordic and baltic snacks operation and several operations in spain and the tax benefit from impairment charges taken in 2008 in addition the 2008 tax rate benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the us federal statutory tax rate and from the expected tax benefit on 2008 restructuring expenses these benefits were only partially offset by state tax expense and certain foreign tax costs 

our 2007 effective tax rate included net tax benefits of 184 million primarily including the effects of dividend repatriation benefits foreign joint venture earnings and the effect on foreign deferred taxes from lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2007 the 2007 tax rate also benefited from foreign earnings taxed below the us federal statutory tax rate an increased domestic manufacturing deduction and the divestiture of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks these benefits were partially offset by state tax expense tax costs associated with the divestiture of our hot cereal assets and trademarks and interest income from altria related to the transfer of our federal tax contingencies 

during 2006 the irs concluded its examination of altria’s consolidated tax returns for the years 1996 through 1999 the irs issued a final revenue agents report on march 15 2006 consequently altria reimbursed us 337 million for federal tax reserves that were no longer necessary and 46 million for interest 29 million net of tax we also recognized net state tax reversals of 39 million for a total tax provision benefit of 376 million 337 million federal plus 39 million state the total benefit to net earnings that we recognized in 2006 due to the irs settlement was 405 million or 024 per diluted share the 2006 tax rate also benefited from the resolution of various tax items in our foreign operations dividend repatriation benefits joint venture earnings and lower foreign tax rates enacted in 2006 primarily canada these benefits were partially offset by state tax expense and by the tax costs associated with our 2006 divestitures 

as a result of our spinoff altria transferred our federal tax contingencies of 375 million to our balance sheet and related interest income of 77 million or 003 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007 following our spinoff from altria we are no longer a member of the altria consolidated tax return group and we now file our own federal consolidated income tax returns although we have taken steps to mitigate the loss of tax benefits as a result of filing separately we currently estimate the annual amount of lost tax benefits to be in the range of 50 million to 75 million

critical accounting policies 

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include kraft as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries our domestic operating subsidiaries report yearend results as of the saturday closest to the end of each year and our international operating subsidiaries generally report yearend results two weeks prior to the saturday closest to the end of each year 

we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence 20 – 50 ownership interest under the equity method of accounting we account for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20 and do not exercise significant influence by the cost method of accounting all intercompany transactions were eliminated 

use of estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements significant accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions include among others pension and benefit plan assumptions lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets marketing programs and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the lastin firstout “lifo” method is used to cost a majority of domestic inventories the cost of other inventories is principally determined by the average cost method we used the lifo method to determine the cost of 35 of inventories at december 31 2008 and 37 of inventories at december 31 2007 the stated lifo amounts of inventories were 152 million lower at december 31 2008 and 142 million lower at december 31 2007 than the current cost of inventories we also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes 

longlived assets 

we review longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing assets held for use for impairment we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal 

goodwill and intangible assets 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment we have recognized goodwill in our reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments we use a two step process to test goodwill at the reporting unit level the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value fair value is estimated using discounted cash flows of the reporting unit based on planned growth rates estimates of discount rates and residual values if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step of the process is necessary the second step measures the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill to test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value fair value of nonamortizable intangible assets is determined using our planned revenue growth rates estimates of discount rates and royalty rates if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

  

effective october 1 2007 we adopted a new accounting policy to perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets as of october 1 of each year the change in our testing date was made to align it with the revised timing of our annual strategic planning process implemented in 2007 prior to that change we performed our annual impairment reviews as of january 1 of each year 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed the annual review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and recorded a 44 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands france and puerto rico estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans industry and economic conditions during our 2008 impairment review it was determined that our kraft biscuit europe reporting unit was the most sensitive to nearterm changes in our discounted cash flow assumptions as it contains a significant portion of the goodwill recorded upon our 2007 acquisition of lu biscuit in 2007 due to the change in our testing date we completed two reviews of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets during the first quarter as of january 1 and during the fourth quarter as of october 1 we found no impairments during these reviews of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets during the first quarter of 2006 we completed our annual review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and recorded a 24 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in egypt and our hot cereal intangible assets in the us these charges were included within asset impairment and exit costs 

insurance and selfinsurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation general liability automobile liability product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers kraft’s shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales a provision for product returns and allowances for bad debts are also recorded as a reduction to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized 

marketing costs 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

environmental costs 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable as of december 31 2008 our subsidiaries were involved in 67 active superfund and other similar actions in the us related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions 

employee benefit plans 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 required us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date beginning in 2008 we previously measured our nonus pension plans other than certain canadian and french pension plans at september 30 of each year on december 31 2008 we recorded an 

  

aftertax decrease of 8 million to retained earnings using the 15month approach to proportionally allocate the transition adjustment required upon adoption of the measurement provision of sfas no 158 the plan assets and benefit obligations of our pension plans and the benefit obligations of our postretirement plans are now all measured at yearend 

we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees these include pension plans postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits consisting primarily of severance we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries refer to note 11 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 

we recorded the following amounts in earnings for these employee benefit plans during the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

   

our 2009 discount rate assumption remained unchanged at 610 for our us postretirement plans and increased to 760 from 580 for our canadian plans our 2009 discount rate decreased to 610 from 630 for our us pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations our 2009 discount rate assumption for our nonus pension plans increased to 641 from 544 we developed the discount rates for our nonus plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear 

our 2009 expected rate of return on plan assets remained unchanged at 800 for our us pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical longterm investment performance current asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments we intend to rebalance our plan portfolios by mid2009 by making contributions and monthly benefit payments 

while we do not anticipate further changes in the 2009 assumptions for our us pension and postretirement health care plans as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point change in our discount rate or a fiftybasis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects reduction  increase in cost as of december 31 2008 

 

 financial instruments 

as kraft operates globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency and commodity price risk management strategies that seek to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices principally through the use of derivative instruments 

financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for hedges of forecasted transactions the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur if we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently 

by using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and commodity prices kraft has exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk we are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties in october 2008 one of our counterparties lehman brothers commercial corporation filed for bankruptcy consequently we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them this did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration greater than one year be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments 

  

we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses or in earnings depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and if it is the type of hedge transaction gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  prior to our spinoff from altria we were included in altria’s consolidated federal income tax return we generally computed income taxes on a separate company basis however some of our foreign tax credits capital losses and other credits could not be used on a separate company basis to the extent that altria used our foreign tax credits and other tax benefits in its consolidated federal income tax return we recognized the benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes this benefit was approximately 270 million in 2007 both through the date of our spinoff as well as postspin carryback claims to prespin periods and 195 million in 2006 we made payments to or were reimbursed by altria for the tax effects resulting from being included in altria’s tax return as of march 31 2007 we are no longer a member of the altria consolidated tax return group and we now file our own federal consolidated income tax returns 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” we adopted the provisions of fin 48 effective january 1 2007 fin 48 clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in the financial statements and provides measurement criteria for valuing such benefits in order for us to recognize benefits our tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement before the implementation of fin 48 we established additional provisions for certain positions that were likely to be challenged even though we believe that those existing tax positions were fully supportable the adoption of fin 48 resulted in an increase to shareholders’ equity as of january 1 2007 of 213 million 

we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

commodity trends 

we are a major purchaser of dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of plastic glass and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 

we purchase our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 significant cost items in our biscuit and grocery products are grains wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant increases as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel grain costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products green coffee bean costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 

during 2008 our aggregate commodity costs rose significantly as a result of higher dairy coffee cocoa wheat nuts meat products soybean oil and packaging costs for 2008 our commodity costs were approximately 18 billion higher than 2007 following an increase of approximately 13 billion in 2007 compared to 2006 overall we expect commodity costs to moderately increase in 2009 

  

liquidity 

we believe that our cash from operations our existing 45 billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper program and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs including the remaining cash requirements of the restructuring program planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations authorized share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends despite recent market conditions we continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines for daily funding requirements we also use shortterm intercompany loans from foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility which have been made more feasible by recent temporary us tax law changes overall we do not foresee any impact to funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 41 billion in 2008 36 billion in 2007 and 37 billion in 2006 operating cash flows increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increased earnings and working capital improvements mainly from lower income tax payments and lower inventory levels partially offset by increased interest paid the increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by the 305 million tax transfer from altria in 2007 for the federal tax contingencies held by them less the impact of federal reserves reversed due to the adoption of fin 48 the transfer from altria was reflected within other in our consolidated statement of cash flows 

the decrease in 2007 operating cash flows from 2006 was due primarily to the 405 million tax reimbursement from altria in 2006 related to the closure of a tax audit and increased marketing administration and research costs this decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by the 305 million tax transfer from altria discussed above and lower working capital of 225 million primarily due to lower income tax payments 

we anticipate making us pension contributions of approximately 220 million in 2009 and nonus pension contributions of approximately 170 million in 2009 we expect to fund these contributions from operations 

net cash used in investing activities 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolios and  or expand our geographic reach through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures we are regularly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sell businesses to accelerate the shift in our portfolio toward businesses  whether global regional or local  that offer us a sustainable competitive advantage the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures could have a material impact on our cash flows 

net cash used in investing activities was 13 billion during 2008 84 billion during 2007 and 116 million during 2006 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2008 primarily related to lower payments for acquisitions partially offset by lower proceeds from divestitures and higher capital expenditures during 2008 we paid groupe danone sa 99 million to refund excess cash received in the acquisition of lu biscuit additionally we received 153 million in net proceeds on divestitures primarily related to a nordic and baltic snacks operation and four operations in spain and we disbursed 56 million for transaction fees related to the splitoff of the post cereals business 

on november 30 2007 we acquired lu biscuit for €51 billion approximately 76 billion in cash additionally during 2007 we received proceeds of 216 million from the divestitures of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks our sugar confectionery assets in romania and related trademarks and our hot cereal assets and trademarks during 2006 we received proceeds of 946 million from the divestitures of our rice brand and assets pet snacks brand and assets industrial coconut assets certain canadian assets a us biscuit brand and a us coffee plant 

capital expenditures which were funded by operating activities were 14 billion in 2008 and 12 billion in 2007 and 2006 the 2008 capital expenditures were primarily used to modernize manufacturing facilities implement the restructuring program and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2009 capital expenditures to be in line with 2008 expenditures including capital expenditures required for systems investments we expect to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in  provided by financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities was 21 billion during 2008 and 37 billion during 2006 compared with 51 billion provided during 2007 the net cash used in financing activities in 2008 primarily related to 59 billion in payments made on the bridge facility used to fund our lu biscuit acquisition 17 billion in dividends paid 777 million in common stock share 

  

repurchases and 795 million in longterm debt repayments primarily related to debt that matured on october 1 2008 partially offset by 69 billion in proceeds from our longterm debt offerings the net cash provided by financing activities in 2007 was primarily due to 64 billion in proceeds from longterm debt offerings and net outstanding borrowings of 55 billion under the bridge facility used to fund our lu biscuit acquisition partially offset by 37 billion in common stock share repurchases 16 billion in dividends paid and a 15 billion repayment of longterm debt that matured the net cash used in financing activities in 2006 primarily related to 16 billion in dividends paid 13 billion in longterm debt repaid and 13 billion in common stock share repurchases 

in november 2009 750 million of our longterm debt matures we expect to fund the repayment through the issuance of commercial paper or longterm debt 

borrowing arrangements 

we maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper issuances the 45 billion multiyear revolving credit facility expires in april 2010 no amounts have been drawn on this facility in october 2008 one of the syndicate banks under our credit facility lehman commercial paper inc filed for bankruptcy protection lehman’s commitment under our credit facility is approximately 136 million we do not expect to replace them and our capacity under our credit facility will accordingly be reduced to approximately 44 billion we do not expect this to have a current or future effect on our liquidity 

we must maintain a net worth of at least 200 billion under the terms of our revolving credit facility at december 31 2008 our net worth was 222 billion we expect to continue to meet this covenant the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security 

in addition to the above some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet shortterm working capital needs collectively these credit lines amounted to 17 billion at december 31 2008 borrowings on these lines amounted to 291 million at december 31 2008 and 250 million at december 31 2007 

at december 31 2007 we had borrowed €38 billion approximately 55 billion under the 364day bridge facility agreement we used to acquire lu biscuit “ lu biscuit bridge facility” under the terms of the credit agreement we were required to repay borrowings with the net cash proceeds from debt offerings having a maturity of greater than one year as such we repaid the €38 billion approximately 59 billion at the time of repayments with proceeds from our march 20 2008 and may 22 2008 debt issuances discussed below upon repayment this facility was terminated 

debt 

our total debt was 203 billion at december 31 2008 and 210 billion at december 31 2007 our debttocapitalization ratio was 048 at december 31 2008 and 043 at december 31 2007 

on december 19 2008 we issued 500 million of senior unsecured notes on may 22 2008 we issued 20 billion of senior unsecured notes and on march 20 2008 we issued €285 billion approximately 45 billion of senior unsecured notes we used the net proceeds from these issuances 498 million in december 1967 million in may and approximately 4470 million in march for general corporate purposes including the repayment of borrowings under our lu biscuit bridge facility and other shortterm borrowings 

on october 1 2008 we repaid 700 million in notes this repayment was primarily financed from commercial paper issuances 

in december 2007 we filed an automatic shelf registration on form s3 with the sec as a wellknown seasoned issuer we are able to register new debt securities in amounts authorized by our board of directors through december 2010 our board of directors authorized 50 billion in longterm financing which was in addition to the €53 billion authorized for the lu biscuit acquisition 

in december 2007 we issued 30 billion of senior unsecured notes under the shelf registration we used the net proceeds from the offering 2966 million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper and a portion of our lu biscuit bridge facility 

in august 2007 we issued 35 billion of senior unsecured notes which was the remainder of the capacity under our former form s3 shelf registration statement on file with the sec we used the net proceeds from the offering 3462 million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper 

  

the notes from all issuances discussed above include covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt secured by liens above a certain threshold we are also required to offer to purchase these notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase if we experience both of the following 

 

  we expect to continue to comply with our longterm debt covenants refer to note 7 debt and borrowing arrangements  for further details of these debt offerings 

we refinance longterm and shortterm debt from time to time the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors at december 31 2008 we had approximately 30 billion remaining in longterm financing authority from our board of directors 

credit ratings 

at december 31 2008 our debt ratings by major credit rating agencies were 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 13 commitments and contingencies  we have thirdparty guarantees because of our acquisition divestiture and construction activities as part of those transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2008 the maximum potential payments under our thirdparty guarantees were 43 million of which 8 million have no specified expiration dates substantially all of the remainder expire at various times through 2018 the carrying amounts of these guarantees were 38 million on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 

in addition at december 31 2008 we were contingently liable for 186 million of guarantees related to our own performance these include letters of credit related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes and other letters of credit 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a material effect on our liquidity 

  

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2008 

 

  

        

equity and dividends 

stock repurchases 

our board of directors authorized the following common stock repurchase programs we are not obligated to repurchase any of our common stock and may suspend our current program at our discretion the total repurchases under these programs were 253 million shares for 777 million in 2008 1101 million shares for 3640 million in 2007 and 387 million shares for 1250 million in 2006 we made these repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions 

 

 as of december 31 2008 we had 723 million remaining under our 50 billion share repurchase authority given the present environment we do not expect to make further share repurchases before the current program authority expires on march 30 2009 

in march 2007 we repurchased 14 million additional shares of our common stock from altria at a cost of 465 million we paid 32085 per share which was the average of the high and the low price of kraft common stock as reported on the nyse on march 1 2007 this repurchase was in accordance with our altria spinoff agreement 

stock plans 

beginning in 2008 we changed our annual and longterm incentive compensation programs to further align them with shareholder returns under the annual incentive program we now grant equity in the form of both restricted or deferred stock and stock options the restricted or deferred stock will continue to vest 100 after three years and the stock options will vest onethird each year beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date additionally we changed our longterm incentive plan from a cashbased program to a sharebased program these shares vest based on varying performance market and service conditions 

in january 2008 we granted 14 million shares of stock in connection with our longterm incentive plan the market value per share was 3226 on the date of grant the unvested shares have no voting rights and do not pay dividends 

in february 2008 as part of our annual incentive program we issued 34 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible us and nonus employees the market value per restricted or deferred share was 2949 on the date of grant also as part of our annual incentive program we granted 135 million stock options to eligible us and nonus employees at an exercise price of 2949 

in addition we also issued 02 million offcycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2008 the weightedaverage market value per restricted or deferred share was 3038 on the date of grant in aggregate we issued 50 million restricted and deferred shares during 2008 including those issued as part of our longterm incentive plan we also granted 01 million offcycle stock options during 2008 at an exercise price of 3078 in aggregate we granted 136 million stock options during 2008 

at december 31 2008 the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options vesting of nonus deferred shares and vesting of longterm incentive plan shares was 445 million or 30 of total shares outstanding 

  

our board of directors approved a stock option grant to our chief executive officer on may 3 2007 to recognize her election as our chairman she received 300000 stock options under the 2005 performance incentive plan which vest under varying market and service conditions and expire ten years after the grant date 

in january 2007 we issued 52 million shares of restricted and deferred stock to eligible us and nonus employees as part of our annual incentive program the market value per restricted or deferred share was 34655 on the date of grant additionally we issued 10 million offcycle shares of restricted and deferred stock during 2007 the weightedaverage market value per restricted or deferred share was 34085 on the date of grant the total number of restricted and deferred shares issued in 2007 was 92 million including those issued as a result of our spinoff from altria discussed below 

upon our spinoff altria stock awards were modified through the issuance of kraft stock awards and accordingly the altria stock awards were split into two instruments holders of altria stock options received 1 a new kraft option to acquire shares of kraft common stock and 2 an adjusted altria stock option for the same number of shares of altria common stock previously held but with a proportionally reduced exercise price for each employee stock option outstanding the aggregate intrinsic value immediately after our spinoff from altria was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to it holders of altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded before january 31 2007 retained their existing awards and received restricted stock or stock rights in kraft common stock recipients of altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded on or after january 31 2007 did not receive kraft restricted stock or stock rights because altria had announced the spinoff at that time we reimbursed altria 179 million for net settlement of the employee stock awards we determined the fair value of the stock options using the blackscholes option valuation model and adjusted the fair value of the restricted stock and stock rights by the value of projected forfeitures 

based upon the number of altria stock awards outstanding upon our spinoff we granted stock options for 242 million shares of common stock at a weightedaverage price of 1575 the options expire between 2007 and 2012 in addition we issued 30 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights the market value per restricted share or right was 3166 on the date of grant restrictions on the majority of these restricted stock and stock rights lapse in either the first quarter of 2008 or 2009 

dividends 

we paid dividends of 1663 million in 2008 and 1638 million in 2007 the 15 increase reflects a higher dividend rate in 2008 partially offset by a lower number of shares outstanding because of share repurchases and the splitoff of the post cereals business during the third quarter of 2008 our board of directors approved a 74 increase in the current quarterly dividend rate to 029 per share on our common stock as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 116 per common share the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making 

2009 outlook 

we now expect 2009 diluted eps of 188 versus a previous expectation of at least 200 this change reflects a greaterthananticipated negative impact from currency and pension costs significantly offset by improved business performance 

our 2009 guidance reflects expectations of approximately 016 in negative impact from currency versus the prior year 008 in higher pension costs and 003 in yearoveryear dilution from the exit of the post cereals business in addition we expect a 009 impact from spending on cost savings initiatives in 2009 and a tax rate of approximately 315 percent up from 2008 which benefited from several discrete items

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend as kraft operates globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency and commodity price risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to crosshedge a commodity exposure we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 12 financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency and commodity price risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures 

in october 2008 one of our counterparties lehman brothers commercial corporation filed for bankruptcy consequently we wrote off an insignificant asset related to derivatives held with them this did not have a significant impact on our foreign currency risk management program 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments we included our debt shortterm investments foreign currency forwards swaps and options and commodity futures forwards and options in our var computation anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we used a “variance  covariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2008 and 2007 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the var model were in millions 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by kraft nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

prior to june 13 2001 kraft was a whollyowned subsidiary of altria group inc “altria” on june 13 2001 we completed an initial public offering of 280000000 shares of our common stock at a price of 3100 per share 

in the first quarter of 2007 altria spun off its remaining interest 890 in kraft on a pro rata basis to altria stockholders in a taxfree transaction effective as of the close of business on march 30 2007 all kraft shares owned by altria were distributed to altria’s stockholders and our separation from altria was completed the “distribution” before the distribution altria converted all of its class b shares of kraft common stock into class a shares of kraft common stock the distribution ratio was calculated by dividing the number of shares of kraft common stock held by altria by the number of altria shares outstanding on the record date march 16 2007 the distribution ratio was 0692024 shares of kraft common stock for every share of altria common stock outstanding following the distribution we only have class a common stock outstanding 

because kraft is a holding company our principal source of funds is dividends from our subsidiaries our principal whollyowned subsidiaries currently are not limited by longterm debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock 

reportable segments 

we manufacture and market packaged food products including snacks beverages cheese convenient meals and various packaged grocery products we manage and report operating results through two commercial units kraft north america and kraft international kraft north america operates in the us and canada and we manage kraft north america’s operations by product category we manage kraft international’s operations by geographic location we have operations in more than 70 countries and sell our products in more than 150 countries 

note 16 to our consolidated financial statements includes a breakout of net revenues and segment operating income by reportable segment for each of the last three years management uses segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment operating income excludes unallocated general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles management believes it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends 

the relative percentages of segment operating income attributable to each reportable segment were 

 

  

   

our brands span five consumer sectors 

 

     the following table shows each reportable segment’s participation in these five core consumer sectors 

 

  

  our us subsidiaries export coffee products refreshment beverages products grocery products cheese biscuits and processed meats in 2007 these exports from the us amounted to 153 million 

products or similar products contributing 10 or more of kraft’s consolidated net revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2007 were 

 

 our major brands within each reportable segment and consumer sector are 

 

   

   

  

 in february 2008 we announced the implementation of our new operating structure our new structure reflects our strategy to rewire the organization for growth  within our new structure business units now have full pl accountability and are staffed accordingly this also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where decisions are made that affect our consumers our corporate and shared service functions are streamlining their organizations and focusing them on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units our new operating structure will result in changes to the reportable business segments within our north america commercial unit beginning in the first quarter of 2008 these changes are 

 

   as a result of implementing our new operating structure we will report the results of operations under this new structure beginning in the first quarter of 2008 and we will restate results from prior periods in a consistent manner 

significant acquisitions and divestitures 

danone biscuit 

on november 30 2007 we acquired the global biscuit business of groupe danone sa “danone biscuit” for €51 billion approximately 76 billion in cash subject to purchase price adjustments on october 12 2007 we entered into a 364day bridge facility agreement and at closing we borrowed €51 billion under that facility in order to finance the acquisition the acquisition included 32 manufacturing facilities and approximately 14000 employees danone biscuit generated global revenues of approximately 28 billion during 2007 danone biscuit will report results from operations on a one month lag as such there was no impact on our operating results in 2007 on a proforma basis danone biscuit’s net earnings for the year ended december 31 2007 would have been insignificant to kraft 

post distribution 

on november 15 2007 we announced a definitive agreement to merge our post cereals business “post business” into ralcorp holdings inc “ralcorp” after a taxfree distribution to our shareholders the “post distribution” we have signed an agreement with ralcorp to execute the post distribution by means of a “reversemorris trust” transaction this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including antitrust approval irs taxfree ruling and ralcorp shareholder approvals to date the antitrust approval has been obtained we anticipate that this transaction will be completed in mid2008 

the post business had net revenues of approximately 11 billion in 2007 and includes such cereals as honey bunches of oats  pebbles  shredded wheat  selects  grape nuts and honeycomb  the brands in this transaction are distributed primarily in north america in addition to the post brands the transaction includes four manufacturing facilities and certain manufacturing equipment we anticipate that approximately 1250 employees will join ralcorp following the consummation of the transaction 

our shareholders will receive at least 303 million shares of ralcorp stock after the post distribution and the subsequent merger of the post business with ralcorp based on market conditions prior to closing we will determine whether the shares will be distributed in a spinoff or a splitoff transaction either type of transaction is expected to be taxfree to our us shareholders in a spinoff transaction our shareholders would receive a pro rata number of ralcorp shares in a splitoff transaction our shareholders would have the option to exchange their kraft shares and receive ralcorp shares at closing resulting in a reduction 

  

in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding in addition kraft will receive approximately 960 million of cashequivalent value which will be used to repay debt 

customers 

our five largest customers accounted for approximately 28 of our net revenues in 2007 29 in 2006 and 26 in 2005 our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 37 of our net revenues in 2007 40 in 2006 and 37 in 2005 one of our customers walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 15 of our net revenues in 2007 15 in 2006 and 14 in 2005 

seasonality 

demand for some of our products may be influenced by holidays changes in seasons or other annual events however sales of our products are generally evenly balanced throughout the year due to the offsetting nature of demands for our diversified product portfolio 

competition 

we face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international companies and numerous local and regional companies some competitors may have different profit objectives and some international competitors may be more or less susceptible to currency exchange rates we also compete with generic products and retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing advertising and price moreover improving our market position or introducing a new product requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures 

distribution 

kraft north america’s products are generally sold to supermarket chains wholesalers supercenters club stores mass merchandisers distributors convenience stores gasoline stations drug stores value stores and other retail food outlets in general the retail trade for food products is consolidating food products are distributed through distribution centers satellite warehouses companyoperated and public coldstorage facilities depots and other facilities we currently distribute most products in north america through warehouse delivery but we deliver biscuits and frozen pizza through two directstore delivery systems we are in the process of combining the executional benefits of directstore delivery with the economics of warehouse delivery and plan to complete the full rollout of a walltowall delivery system by mid2008 where one sales representative covers an entire store we support our selling efforts through three principal sets of activities consumer advertising in broadcast print outdoor and online media consumer incentives such as coupons and contests and trade promotions to support price features displays and other merchandising of our products by our customers subsidiaries and affiliates of kraft international sell their food products primarily in the same manner and also engage the services of independent sales offices and agents 

raw materials 

we are major purchasers of dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production we purchase a substantial portion of our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were 750 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 

the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products in 2007 coffee bean costs on average were higher than in 2006 a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound sterling and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies in 2007 cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher than in 2006 significant cost items in our 

  

biscuit cereal and grocery products are grains or wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant cost increases as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel in 2007 grain costs on average were higher than in 2006 

during 2007 our aggregate commodity costs rose significantly as a result of higher dairy coffee cocoa wheat meat products soybean oil and packaging costs partially offset by lower nut costs for 2007 our commodity costs were approximately 1250 million higher than 2006 following an increase of approximately 275 million for 2006 compared with 2005 we expect the higher cost environment to continue particularly for dairy grains energy and packaging 

the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products generally reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 

intellectual property 

we consider our trademarks in the aggregate to be material to our business we protect our trademarks by registration or otherwise in the us and in other markets where we sell our products trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and in other countries for as long as it is registered registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms from time to time we grant third parties licenses to use one or more of our trademarks in particular locations similarly we sell some of our products under brands we license and those licenses are generally renewable at our discretion these licensed brands include among others 

 

        additionally we own numerous patents worldwide while our patent portfolio is material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business we have either been issued patents or have patent applications pending that relate to a number of current and potential products including products licensed to others patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country we consider that in the aggregate our patent applications patents and licenses under patents owned by third parties are of material importance to our operations we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings relating to the scope of protection and validity of our patents and those of others these proceedings may result in a significant commitment of our resources in the future and depending on their outcome may adversely affect the validity and scope of certain of our patent or other proprietary rights 

we also have proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights that are not registered 

research and development 

we pursue four objectives in research and development product safety and quality growth through new products superior consumer satisfaction and reduced costs we have more than 2100 food scientists chemists and engineers working primarily in 

  

six key technology centers east hanover new jersey glenview illinois tarrytown new york banbury united kingdom paris france and munich germany these technology centers are equipped with pilot plants and stateoftheart instruments research and development expense was 447 million in 2007 419 million in 2006 and 385 million in 2005 

regulation 

our us food products and packaging materials are regulated by the food and drug administration or for products containing meat and poultry the food safety and inspection service of the us department of agriculture these agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing distribution and labeling of food products 

in addition various states regulate our us operations by licensing plants enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products grading food products inspecting plants and warehouses regulating trade practices related to the sale of dairy products and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 

many of the food commodities we use in our us operations are subject to governmental agricultural programs these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 

all of our nonusbased operations are subject to local and national regulations some of which are similar to those applicable to our us operations for example in the eu requirements apply to labeling packaging food content pricing marketing and advertising and related areas 

environmental regulation 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable in the us the laws and regulations include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery act and superfund which imposes joint and severable liability on each responsible party as of december 31 2007 our subsidiaries were involved in 70 active superfund and other similar actions in the us related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

outside the us we are subject to applicable multinational national and local environmental laws and regulations in the host countries in which we do business we have specific programs across our international business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 

based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we employed approximately 103000 people worldwide labor unions represent approximately 30 of our 41000 employees in the us most of the unionized workers at our domestic locations are represented under contracts with the bakery confectionery tobacco workers and grain millers international union the united food and commercial workers international union and the international brotherhood of teamsters these contracts expire at various times throughout the next several years outside the us labor unions or workers’ councils represent approximately 55 of our 62000 employees our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each enterprise in addition in accordance with eu requirements we have established european works councils composed of management and elected members of our workforce we believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good 

in january 2004 we announced a threeyear restructuring program the “restructuring program” and in january 2006 extended it through 2008 in connection with our severance initiatives we have eliminated approximately 11000 positions as of december 31 2007 at that time we had announced the elimination of an additional 400 positions upon completion of the restructuring program we expect to have eliminated approximately 13500 positions

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forwardlooking information contained in this annual report on form 10k any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this annual report on form 10k while we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future 

we operate in a highly competitive industry which may affect our profitability 

the food industry is intensely competitive we compete based on price product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences from time to time we may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain our market share competition and customer pressures however also may restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other input cost increases our results of operations will suffer if profit margins decrease as a result of either a reduction in prices or increased input costs and if we are unable to increase sales volumes to offset those profit margin decreases 

we may also need to increase spending on marketing advertising and new product innovation to protect existing market share or capture increased market share the success of our investments is subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance as a result our increased expenditures may not maintain or enhance market share and could result in lower profitability 

our brand image may be challenged to compete against lowerpriced private label items particularly in times of economic downturns 

retailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products consumers’ willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price it is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives if the difference in quality between our products and those of store brands narrows or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed then consumers may not buy our products furthermore during periods of economic uncertainty consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our higher margin products or there could be a shift in our product mix to our lower margin offerings if we are not able to maintain or improve our brand image it could have a material affect on our market share and our profitability 

  

consolidation of retail customers may affect our operating margins and profitability in addition the loss of a significant customer could significantly affect our results of operations 

retail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors continue to consolidate in the us the eu and our other major markets these consolidations have produced large sophisticated customers with increased buying power these larger retailers are capable of operating with reduced inventories they can resist price increases and they demand lower pricing increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products they also may use shelf space currently used for our products for their own private label products if we fail to respond to these trends our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower our prices or increase our investments in marketing any of which could adversely affect our profitability 

our largest customer walmart stores inc accounted for approximately 15 of our net revenues during 2007 during 2007 our five largest customers accounted for approximately 28 of our net revenues the loss of any one of our top customers could have a material adverse affect on our sales 

continuing increases in commodity costs may affect our profitability 

we are a major purchaser of commodities including dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses price volatility for commodities we purchase has increased due to conditions outside of our control including fluctuations in commodities markets currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increased commodity costs or achieve cost efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution our profitability could suffer 

our product sales depend on our ability to predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and develop and offer new products rapidly enough to meet those changes 

consumer preferences for food products change continually for example recently consumers have been increasingly focused on health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy as a result over the last several years our products have been subject to scrutiny relating to genetically modified organisms and the health implications of obesity and transfatty acids our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to those preferences we have been and will continue to be affected by publicity concerning the health implications of our products some of which could negatively influence consumer perception and acceptance of our products and marketing programs 

furthermore if we do not succeed in offering products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability will suffer we must be able to distinguish among shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we are unable to accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales will decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer a sufficient array of products to satisfy the broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to successfully innovate products across a multitude of product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing and more profitable categories demand for our products will decrease and our profitability could suffer 

our international operations are subject to additional risks 

approximately 42 of our 2007 sales and approximately 39 of our 2006 sales were generated in foreign countries our international operations are subject to inherent risks including fluctuations in currency values unpredictability of foreign currency exchange controls discriminatory fiscal policies unexpected changes in local regulations and laws in foreign countries and the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions in addition international sales are subject to risks related to imposition of tariffs quotas trade barriers and other similar restrictions moreover economic changes terrorist activity political unrest and other economic or political uncertainties may interrupt or otherwise negatively affect our business all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues either of which could adversely affect our profitability 

we may not be able to successfully consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures or successfully integrate acquired businesses 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that would strategically fit our business objectives if we are unable to complete successfully integrate and develop these acquisition candidates to realize revenue growth and cost savings our 

  

financial results could be adversely affected in addition from time to time we divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or do not meet our growth or profitability targets our profitability may be affected by either gains or losses on the sales of or lost operating income from those businesses also we may not be able to complete desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures which may reduce our profitability finally our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including diversion of management attention from existing core businesses integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers any of these activities could affect our product sales financial conditions and results of operations 

product recalls injuries caused by products or other legal claims could affect our reputation and profitability 

selling products for human consumption involves inherent legal risks we could be required to recall products due to product contamination spoilage or other adulteration product misbranding or product tampering we may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our advertising could be the target of claims of false or deceptive advertising a significant product liability or other legal judgment against us or a widespread product recall may adversely affect our profitability moreover even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and brand image 

we operate in a highly regulated environment 

food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal state local and foreign agencies new regulations and changes to existing regulations are issued regularly increased governmental regulation of the food industry such as proposed requirements designed to enhance food safety or to regulate imported ingredients could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability 

changes in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs 

we maintain revolving credit facilities that historically have been used to support the issuance of commercial paper a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly our shortterm debt rating would likely reduce the amount of commercial paper we could issue or it could raise our borrowing costs or both 

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs 

at the end of 2007 the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension plans was 102 billion and assets were 110 billion the difference between plan obligations and assets or the funded status of the plans significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans among other factors changes in interest rates mortality rates early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can i affect the level of plan funding ii cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and iii increase our future funding requirements in addition if we divest certain businesses we may be required to increase future contributions to the benefit plans and the related net periodic pension cost could increase a significant increase in our funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and profitability

discussion and analysis 

growth strategy 

at the consumer analyst group of new york “cagny” conference in february 2008 we presented the progress we made in 2007 on our longterm growth strategy and our plans for the second year of our threeyear plan to return kraft to reliable growth our four growth strategies and 2007 developments are summarized below 

rewire the organization for growth  we made significant changes to our incentive systems senior management team and organizational structure our annual bonuses and longterm incentive plans are now tied to measures that our people can control and that will increase shareholder value such as operating income growth we also complemented our veteran kraft management team by adding new talent in february 2008 we announced the implementation of our new operating structure built on three core elements business units now have full pl accountability and are staffed accordingly shared services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio and a streamlined corporate staff 

reframe our categories  we are utilizing the concept of the “growth diamond” to focus on four key consumer trends driving category growth snacking quick meals health and wellness and premium 

we also reframed our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures in 2007 we divested our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks including veryfine and fruit2o  and acquired the danone biscuit business these changes will result in increased revenues being derived from kraft international we also announced the planned merger of the post business into ralcorp which we anticipate will be completed in mid2008 

exploit our sales capabilities  we are using our large scale as a competitive advantage as we better leverage our portfolio our “walltowall” initiative for kraft north america combined the executional benefits of direct store delivery used in our biscuit business unit with the economics of our warehouse delivery to drive faster growth walltowall will increase the frequency of our retail visits and build stronger ongoing relationships with store management allowing us to reduce outofstocks get new items to the shelves more quickly and increase the number and quality of displays we plan to complete the full rollout in north america by mid2008 

we plan to build profitable scale by expanding our distribution reach in countries with rapidly growing demand the acquisition of danone biscuit is part of our efforts to expand our reach in developing markets 

drive down costs without compromising quality  we plan to contain administrative overhead costs while investing in quality rd marketing sales and other capabilities that support growth we are incrementally investing 100 million into quality upgrades in 2008 additionally we anticipate completing our restructuring program in 2008 with total annualized savings reaching 12 billion by the end of 2009 

  

summary of financial results 

the following tables show the significant changes in our net earnings and diluted eps between 2007 and 2006 and between 2006 and 2005 in millions except per share data 

 

 see below for a discussion of those events affecting comparability and a discussion of operating results 

acquisitions and divestitures

restructuring program 

in january 2004 we announced a threeyear restructuring program the “restructuring program” and in january 2006 extended it through 2008 the objectives of this program are to leverage our global scale realign and lower our cost structure and optimize capacity as part of the restructuring program we anticipate 

 

    in february 2008 we announced the implementation of our new operating structure built on three core elements accountable business units shared services that leverage the scale of our global portfolio and a streamlined corporate staff within our new structure business units now have full pl accountability and are staffed accordingly this also ensures that we are putting our resources closer to where decisions are made that affect our consumers our corporate and shared service functions are streamlining their organizations and focusing them on core activities that can more efficiently support the goals of the business units the intent was to simplify streamline and increase accountability with the ultimate goal of generating reliable growth for kraft as a result we have eliminated approximately 700 positions as we streamline our headquarters functions

critical accounting policies 

note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” which require us to make certain elections as to our accounting policy estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods significant accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions include among others pension and benefit plan assumptions lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets marketing programs and income taxes actual results could differ from those estimates 

we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 

  

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include kraft as well as our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries our domestic operating subsidiaries report yearend results as of the saturday closest to the end of each year and our international operating subsidiaries generally report yearend results two weeks prior to the saturday closest to the end of each year this resulted in 53 weeks of operating results in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december 31 2005 versus 52 weeks for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 the results of operations from our newly acquired global biscuit business of groupe danone sa will be reported on a one month lag we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence 20  50 ownership interest under the equity method of accounting we account for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than 20 and do not exercise significant influence by the cost method of accounting all intercompany transactions were eliminated transactions between kraft and altria are included in the consolidated financial statements 

use of estimates 

we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our financial statements these amounts include among others employee benefit costs and income taxes we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the lastin firstout “lifo” method is used to cost a majority of domestic inventories the cost of other inventories is principally determined by the average cost method we used the lifo method to determine the cost of 37 of inventories at december 31 2007 and 41 of inventories at december 31 2006 the stated lifo amounts of inventories were 142 million lower at december 31 2007 and 70 million higher at december 31 2006 than the current cost of inventories we also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes 

longlived assets 

we review longlived assets including amortizable intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing assets held for use for impairment we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposal during 2006 we recorded noncash asset impairment charges of 245 million related to our tassimo hot beverage system longlived assets the charges are included in asset impairment and exit costs in the consolidated statement of earnings 

goodwill and intangible assets 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  “sfas no 142” requires us to test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets at least annually for impairment to test goodwill we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is considered impaired the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill which is determined using discounted cash flows to test nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment we compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

since our adoption of sfas no 142 we have completed our annual impairment review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets as of january 1 during the first quarter of 2007 we completed our annual review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets and found no impairments effective october 1 2007 we adopted a new accounting policy to perform our annual impairment review of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets as of october 1 instead of january 1 of each year the change in our testing date was made to align it with the revised timing of our annual strategic planning process implemented in 2007 as a result we performed our annual impairment tests again as of october 1 2007 and found no impairments during the first quarter of 2006 we completed our annual review of goodwill and intangible assets and recorded a 24 million noncash charge for impairment of biscuits assets in egypt and hot cereal assets in the us the charge is included 

  

in asset impairment and exit costs in the consolidated statement of earnings during the first quarter of 2005 we completed our annual review of goodwill and intangible assets no impairments resulted from this review 

during the forth quarter of 2007 we acquired goodwill of 5239 million and intangible assets of 2196 million as part of the danone biscuit acquisition these amounts represent the preliminary allocation of purchase price and are subject to revision when appraisals are finalized which will occur during 2008 the application of fas no 141 business combinations  requires a number of significant judgments including the valuation of the cost of the acquisition and the assignment of such costs based on the estimated fair values of asses acquired and liabilities assumed 

insurance  selfinsurance 

we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers’ compensation general liability automobile liability product liability and our obligation for employee healthcare benefits liabilities associated with the risks are estimated by considering historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers which occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers kraft’s shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales we also record provisions and allowances for estimated sales returns and bad debts in our consolidated financial statements the amounts recorded for these provisions and related allowances are not significant to our financial statements 

marketing costs 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions these programs include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates for interim reporting purposes advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year we do not defer costs on our yearend consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 

environmental costs 

we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment we accrue for environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated the accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable as of december 31 2007 our subsidiaries were involved in 70 active superfund and other similar actions in the us related to current operations and certain former or divested operations for which we retain liability 

based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results however we cannot quantify with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remediation actions 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes  prior to the distribution we were included in altria’s consolidated federal income tax return we generally computed income taxes on a separate company basis however some of our foreign tax credits capital losses and other credits could not have been used on a separate company basis to the extent that altria used our foreign tax credits and other tax benefits in its consolidated federal income tax return we recognized the benefit in the calculation of our provision for income taxes this benefit was approximately 270 million in 2007 both through the date of distribution as well as postdistribution carryback claims to predistribution periods 195 million in 2006 and 225 in 2005 we made payments to or were reimbursed by altria for the tax effects resulting from being included in altria’s tax return as of march 31 2007 we are no longer a member of the altria consolidated tax return group and will file our own federal consolidated income tax return 

  

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” we adopted the provisions of fin 48 effective january 1 2007 fin 48 clarifies when tax benefits should be recorded in the financial statements and provides measurement criteria for valuing such benefits in order for us to recognize benefits our tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon audit the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement before the implementation of fin 48 we established additional provisions for certain positions that were likely to be challenged even though we believe that those existing tax positions were fully supportable the adoption of fin 48 resulted in an increase to shareholders’ equity as of january 1 2007 of 213 million 

we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

employee benefit plans 

as discussed in note 9 benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees these include pension plans postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits consisting primarily of severance we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates assumed rates of return on plan assets compensation increases turnover rates and health care cost trend rates we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate as permitted by us gaap we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans “sfas no 158” sfas no 158 requires us to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet subsequent changes in funded status that are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income we prospectively adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of sfas no 158 on december 31 2006 the adoption resulted in a decrease to total assets of 2286 million a decrease to total liabilities of 235 million and a decrease to shareholders’ equity of 2051 million 

sfas no 158 also requires us to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date beginning in 2008 we currently measure our nonus pension plans other than canadian pension plans at september 30 of each year we expect to adopt the measurement date provision of sfas no 158 and measure these plans as of our operating subsidiaries’ yearend close date beginning in 2008 we are presently evaluating the impact of the measurement date change which is not expected to be significant 

during the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we recorded the following amounts in the consolidated statements of earnings for employee benefit plans 

 

 the 2007 net expense for employee benefit plans of 818 million decreased by 218 million over the 2006 amount the cost decrease primarily relates to lower us pension plan costs including lower amortization of the net loss from experience differences and lower postemployment benefit plan costs related to the restructuring program the 2006 net expense for employee benefit plans of 1036 million increased by 154 million over the 2005 amount this cost increase primarily related 

  

to higher postemployment benefit plan costs related to the restructuring program as well as higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences in our us and nonus pension plan costs and postretirement health care costs 

at december 31 2007 our health care cost trend rate assumption decreased from 800 to 750 for our us postretirement plans and increased from 850 to 900 for our canadian postretirement plans we updated these rates based upon our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be 500 for us plans and 600 for canadian plans by 2013 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects as of december 31 2007 

 

 at december 31 2007 our discount rate assumption increased from 590 to 610 for our us postretirement plans and increased from 590 to 630 for our us pension plans we model our discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations changes in our discount rates are primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear our expected rate of return on plan assets remained unchanged at 80 we presently anticipate that assumption changes coupled with the amortization of deferred gains and losses will result in a decrease in 2008 pretax us and nonus pension and postretirement expense while we do not presently anticipate further changes in our 2008 assumptions as a sensitivity measure a fiftybasis point decline in our discount rate would increase our us pension and postretirement expense by approximately 80 million and a fiftybasis point increase in our discount rate would decrease our us pension and postretirement expense by approximately 75 million similarly a fiftybasis point decrease  increase in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase  decrease our us pension expense by approximately 33 million 

transactions with altria group inc 

on march 30 2007 we entered into a postspin transition services agreement with altria’s subsidiary altria corporate services inc “alcs” under the agreement alcs was providing information technology services to kraft during the eds transition billings for these postspin services were 10 million from april 2007 to december 31 2007 before the distribution alcs provided prespin administrative services to us under a separate corporate services agreement that expired on march 30 2007 these services included planning legal treasury auditing insurance human resources office of the secretary corporate affairs information technology aviation and tax services billings for these prespin services which were based on the cost to alcs to provide such services and a 5 management fee based on wages and benefits were 19 million for the quarter ended march 31 2007 178 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and 237 million for the year ended december 31 2005 we performed at a similar cost various functions in 2007 and 2006 that previously had been provided by alcs resulting in lower expense in 2007 and 2006 as of january 1 2008 alcs no longer provides services to kraft 

on march 30 2007 we also entered into employee matters and tax sharing agreements with altria the employee matters agreement sets out each company’s obligations for employee transfers equity compensation and other employee benefits matters for individuals moving or who previously moved between companies the tax sharing agreement identifies altria’s and kraft’s rights responsibilities and obligations with respect to our income taxes following the distribution it also places certain restrictions on us including a 2year limit on share repurchases of no more than 20 of our common stock outstanding at the time of the distribution 

at the distribution we had shortterm amounts payable to altria and affiliates of 449 million which included 364 million of accrued dividends we paid these amounts in april 2007 at december 31 2007 we had no shortterm amounts payable to altria and affiliates for transition services at december 31 2006 we had shortterm amounts payable to altria and affiliates of 607 million the fair values of our shortterm amounts due to altria and affiliates approximated carrying amounts 

in the first quarter 2007 we repurchased 14 million shares of our common stock from altria at a cost of 465 million we paid 32085 per share which was the average of the high and the low price of kraft common stock as reported on the nyse on march 1 2007 this repurchase was in accordance with the distribution agreement 

  

also see note 5 income taxes  for information on how the closure of an irs review of altria’s consolidated federal income tax return in 2006 impacted us 

financial instruments 

as kraft operates globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall riskmanagement program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency and commodity price risk management strategies that seek to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices principally through the use of derivative instruments 

financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items as well as our riskmanagement objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for hedges of forecasted transactions the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur if we deem it probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur we recognize the gain or loss in earnings currently 

by using derivatives to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and commodity prices kraft has exposure on these derivatives to credit and market risk we are exposed to credit risk that the counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of the derivative contract we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with highquality counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement market risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies and the degree of market risk that may be undertaken by the use of derivative instruments 

we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either current assets or current liabilities changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses or in earnings depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and if it is the type of hedge transaction gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive earnings  losses are reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

commodity trends 

we are major purchasers of dairy coffee cocoa wheat corn products soybean and vegetable oils nuts meat products and sugar and other sweeteners we also use significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard to package our products and natural gas for our factories and warehouses we continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production we purchase a substantial portion of our dairy raw material requirements including milk and cheese from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors the prices for milk and other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by market supply and demand as well as by government programs dairy commodity costs on average were 750 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 

the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products in 2007 coffee bean costs on average were higher than in 2006 a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of the british pound sterling and the us dollar relative to certain other currencies in 2007 cocoa bean and cocoa butter costs on average were higher than in 2006 significant cost items in our 

  

biscuit cereal and grocery products are grains or wheat corn and soybean oil grain costs have experienced significant cost increases as a result of burgeoning global demand for food livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel in 2007 grain costs on average were higher than in 2006 

during 2007 our aggregate commodity costs rose significantly as a result of higher dairy coffee cocoa wheat meat products soybean oil and packaging costs partially offset by lower nut costs for 2007 our commodity costs were approximately 1250 million higher than 2006 following an increase of approximately 275 million in 2006 compared to 2005 we expect the higher cost environment to continue particularly for dairy grains energy and packaging 

liquidity 

we believe that our cash from operations our existing 45 billion credit facility and our authorized longterm financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs including the cash requirements of the restructuring program planned capital expenditures future contractual obligations authorized share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends 

net cash provided by operating activities 

operating activities provided net cash of 36 billion in 2007 37 billion in 2006 and 35 billion in 2005 operating cash flows decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to the 405 million tax reimbursement from altria in 2006 related to the closure of a tax audit and increased marketing administration and research costs this decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by lower working capital costs of 225 million primarily due to lower income tax payments and the 305 million tax transfer from altria for the federal tax contingencies held by them less the impact of federal reserves reversed due to the adoption of fin 48 the transfer from altria is reflected within other in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

the increase in 2006 operating cash flows from 2005 is due primarily to the previously discussed tax reimbursement from altria in 2006 related to the closure of a tax audit and higher earnings partially offset by a decrease in amounts due to altria and higher pension contributions 

net cash provided by used in investing activities 

one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolios andor expand our geographic reach through disciplined programs of selective acquisitions and divestitures we are constantly reviewing potential acquisition candidates and from time to time sell businesses to accelerate the shift in our portfolio toward businesses  whether global regional or local  that offer us a sustainable competitive advantage the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures could have a material impact on our cash flows 

net cash used in investing activities was 84 billion during 2007 and 116 million during 2006 as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of 525 million in 2005 the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 primarily related to the danone biscuit acquisition and lower proceeds from divestitures on november 30 2007 we acquired the global biscuit business of groupe danone sa for approximately €51 billion approximately 76 billion in cash subject to purchase price adjustments 

during 2007 we received proceeds of 216 million from the sales of our flavored water and juice brand assets and related trademarks our sugar confectionery assets in romania and related trademarks and our hot cereal assets and trademarks during 2006 we received proceeds of 946 million from the sales of our rice brand and assets pet snacks brand and assets industrial coconut assets certain canadian assets a small us biscuit brand and a us coffee plant during 2005 we received proceeds of 1668 million from the sales of our sugar confectionery business fruit snacks assets uk desserts assets us yogurt assets a small operation in colombia a small equity investment in turkey and a minor trademark in mexico 

capital expenditures which were funded by operating activities were 12 billion in each of the last three years the 2007 capital expenditures were primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities implement the restructuring program and support new product and productivity initiatives we expect 2008 capital expenditures to be in line with 2007 expenditures including capital expenditures required for the restructuring program and systems investments we expect to fund these expenditures from operations 

net cash used in financing activities 

during 2007 we received 51 billion net cash in financing activities compared with 37 billion that we used during 2006 the increase in net cash provided by financing activities is due primarily to the 35 billion and 30 billion longterm debt offerings 

  

and net outstanding borrowings of 55 billion under the bridge facility used to fund our danone biscuit acquisition partially offset by 37 billion in common stock share repurchases and a 15 billion repayment of longterm debt that matured in 2007 

during 2006 we used 37 billion net cash in financing activities compared with 40 billion that we used during 2005 the decrease in net cash used in 2006 was due primarily to a decrease in net debt repayments partially offset by an increase in our common stock share repurchases and dividend payments 

borrowing arrangements 

on october 12 2007 we entered into a 364day bridge facility agreement for €53 billion for our pending acquisition of danone biscuit “danone biscuit bridge facility” upon closing of the transaction we borrowed €51 billion approximately 75 billion under this facility to finance the acquisition we intend to repay our outstanding borrowings under this facility with proceeds from the issuance of investment grade bonds or other securities according to the credit agreement aggregate net cash proceeds in excess of 10 billion from debt offerings having a maturity of greater than one year are required to be repaid as such we repaid approximately €13 billion 20 billion of the bridge facility with the proceeds from our december 2007 debt issuance additionally proceeds from equity offerings are required to be repaid under the facility and drawings under this facility may be reduced by the aggregate proceeds in excess of 10 billion from certain divestitures of assets this facility replaced a commitment letter we entered into upon the announcement of the danone biscuit acquisition 

on may 24 2007 we entered into a 15 billion 364day revolving credit agreement in accordance with the terms of that agreement it was terminated upon our issuance of the 35 billion of senior unsecured notes in august 2007 

we maintain a revolving credit facility that we have historically used for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper issuances the 45 billion multiyear revolving credit facility expires in april 2010 no amounts were drawn on this facility at december 31 2007 

we must maintain a net worth of at least 200 billion under the terms of our revolving credit facility at december 31 2007 our net worth was 273 billion we expect to continue to meet this covenant the revolving credit facility has no other financial covenants credit rating triggers or provisions that could require us to post collateral as security 

in addition to the above some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet shortterm working capital needs collectively these credit lines amounted to 15 billion at december 31 2007 borrowings on these lines amounted to 250 million at december 31 2007 and 465 million at december 31 2006 which included 282 million of outstanding shortterm debt related to our united biscuits acquisition discussed in note 11 acquisitions

our total debt was 210 billion at december 31 2007 and 108 billion at december 31 2006 our total debt balance at december 31 2006 included amounts due to altria and affiliates our debttocapitalization ratio was 043 at december 31 2007 and 027 at december 31 2006 

in august 2007 we issued 35 billion of senior unsecured notes which was the remainder of the capacity under our existing form s3 shelf registration statement on file with the sec we used the net proceeds from the offering approximately 3462 million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper 

in december 2007 we filed an automatic shelf registration on form s3 with the sec as a wellknown seasoned issuer we are able to register new debt securities in amounts authorized by our board of directors through december 2010 our board of directors authorized 50 billion in longterm financing which was in addition to the €53 billion authorized for the danone biscuit acquisition 

in december 2007 we issued 30 billion of senior unsecured notes under the shelf registration we used the net proceeds from the offering approximately 2966 million for general corporate purposes including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper and a portion of our danone biscuit bridge facility refer to note 4 debt and borrowing arrangements  for further details of these debt offerings 

we refinance longterm and shortterm debt from time to time the nature and amount of our longterm and shortterm debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of future business requirements market conditions and other factors at december 31 2007 we had approximately 95 billion remaining in longterm financing authority from our board of directors 

  

approximately 55 billion approximately €38 billion was earmarked for the refinancing of our danone biscuit bridge facility 

at december 31 2007 we had no shortterm amounts payable to altria and its affiliates for transition services at december 31 2006 we had shortterm amounts payable to altria and affiliates of 607 million which included 364 million of accrued dividends prior to the distribution the amounts payable to altria generally included accrued dividends taxes and service fees

 offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 

we have no offbalance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below 

guarantees 

as discussed in note 15 commitments and contingencies  we have thirdparty guarantees because of our acquisition divestiture and construction activities as part of those transactions we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures at december 31 2007 the maximum potential payments under our thirdparty guarantees were 32 million of which 8 million have no specified expiration dates substantially all of the remainder expire at various times through 2016 the carrying amounts of these guarantees were 25 million on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2007 

in addition at december 31 2007 we were contingently liable for 180 million of guarantees related to our own performance these include surety bonds related to dairy commodity purchases and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes and letters of credit 

guarantees do not have and we do not expect them to have a significant impact on our liquidity 

aggregate contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2007 

 

  

    

   equity and dividends 

stock repurchases 

our board of directors authorized the following common stock repurchase programs we are not obligated to repurchase any of our common stock and may suspend any program at our discretion the total repurchases under these programs were 1101 million shares for 3640 million in 2007 387 million shares for 1250 million in 2006 and 392 million shares for 1200 million in 2005 we made these repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions

stock based compensation 

at the distribution altria stock awards were modified through the issuance of kraft stock awards and accordingly the altria stock awards were split into two instruments holders of altria stock options received 1 a new kraft option to acquire shares of kraft common stock and 2 an adjusted altria stock option for the same number of shares of altria common stock 

  

previously held but with a proportionally reduced exercise price for each employee stock option outstanding the aggregate intrinsic value immediately after the distribution was not greater than the aggregate intrinsic value immediately prior to the distribution holders of altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded before january 31 2007 retained their existing awards and received restricted stock or stock rights in kraft common stock recipients of altria restricted stock or stock rights awarded on or after january 31 2007 did not receive kraft restricted stock or stock rights because altria had announced the distribution at that time we reimbursed altria 179 million for net settlement of the employee stock awards as detailed below we determined the fair value of the stock options using the blackscholes option valuation model and adjusted the fair value of the restricted stock and stock rights by the value of projected forfeitures 

in april 2007 we paid the following to altria in millions 

 

 based upon the number of altria stock awards outstanding at distribution we granted stock options for 242 million shares of common stock at a weightedaverage price of 1575 the options expire between 2007 and 2012 in addition we issued 30 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights the market value per restricted share or right was 3166 on the date of grant restrictions on the majority of these restricted stock and stock rights lapse in either the first quarter of 2008 or 2009 

our board of directors approved a stock option grant to our chief executive officer on may 3 2007 to recognize her election as our chairman she received 300000 stock options under the 2005 performance incentive plan which vest under varying market and service conditions and expire ten years after the grant date 

in january 2007 we issued 52 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights to eligible us and nonus employees as part of our annual incentive program restrictions on these shares and rights lapse in the first quarter of 2010 the market value per restricted share or right was 34655 on the date of grant additionally we issued 10 million offcycle shares of restricted stock and stock rights during 2007 the weightedaverage market value per restricted share or right was 34085 on the date of grant the total number of restricted shares and rights issued in 2007 was 92 million including those issued as a result of the distribution 

in 2006 we issued approximately 69 million shares of restricted stock and stock rights to eligible us and nonus employees restrictions on most of these shares and rights lapse in the first quarter of 2009 the market value per restricted share or right was 2916 on the date of grant 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment  using the modified prospective method which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stockbased awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service periods for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock and rights to receive shares of stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the market value at date of grant the fair value of stock options is determined using a modified blackscholes methodology the impact of adoption was not material at december 31 2007 the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of nonus rights to receive equivalent shares was 375 million or 24 of total shares outstanding 

dividends 

we paid dividends of 1638 million in 2007 and 1562 million in 2006 the 49 increase reflects a higher dividend rate in 2007 partially offset by a lower number of shares outstanding because of share repurchases during the third quarter of 2007 our board of directors approved an 80 increase in the current quarterly dividend rate to 027 per share on our common stock as a result the present annualized dividend rate is 108 per common share the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and depends on various factors including our net earnings financial condition cash requirements future prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant to its analysis and decisionmaking 

  

2008 outlook 

we expect diluted eps of at least 156 for 2008 our guidance reflects 034 per diluted share in costs related to the restructuring program up from 019 in 2007 also reflected in our guidance we expect an effective tax rate of 340 for 2008 

guidance reflects our expectation for greater savings from our restructuring program total costs are expected to be 28 billion down from our previous expectation of 30 billion we also expect cumulative annualized savings to reach 12 billion by the end of 2009 our guidance reflects the inclusion of the danone biscuit business for 2008 but does not include the impact of our agreement to merge our post business with ralcorp holdings inc

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend as kraft operates globally we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risks we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall riskmanagement program our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results we maintain foreign currency and commodity price risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices we occasionally use related futures to crosshedge a commodity exposure however we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and by policy do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes refer to notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency and commodity price risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures 

value at risk 

we use a value at risk “var” computation to estimate 1 the potential oneday loss in the fair value of our interest ratesensitive financial instruments and 2 the potential oneday loss in pretax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity pricesensitive derivative financial instruments we included our debt shortterm investments foreign currency forwards swaps and options and commodity futures forwards and options in our var computation anticipated transactions foreign currency trade payables and receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge were excluded from the computation 

we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions using a 95 confidence interval we used a “variancecovariance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december 31 2007 and 2006 and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a onetoone basis with the underlying currency or commodity and were valued accordingly in the var computation 

  

the estimated potential oneday loss in fair value of our interest ratesensitive instruments primarily debt under normal market conditions and the estimated potential oneday loss in pretax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments under normal market conditions as calculated in the var model were in millions 

 

 this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by kraft nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results

c narrative description of business

                         acquisitions and divestitures

nabisco acquisition

     on december 11 2000 the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
nabisco for 55 per share in cash the purchase of the outstanding shares
retirement of employee stock options and other payments totaled approximately
152 billion in addition the acquisition included the assumption of
approximately 40 billion of existing nabisco debt the company financed the
acquisition through the issuance of two longterm notes payable to philip morris
totaling 150 billion and shortterm intercompany borrowings of 255 million
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase nabiscos balance sheet
was consolidated with the company as of december 31 2000 and beginning january
1 2001 nabiscos earnings have been included in the consolidated operating
results of the company however nabiscos earnings from december 11 2000 to
december 31 2000 were not included in the consolidated operating results of the
company since such amounts were insignificant the companys interest cost
associated with acquiring nabisco has been included in interest and other debt
expense net on the companys consolidated statements of earnings for the years
ended december 31 2001 and 2000

     the integration of nabisco into the company has continued throughout 2001
the closure of a number of nabisco domestic and international facilities
resulted in severance and other exit costs of 379 million which are included
in the adjustments for the allocation of purchase price the closures will
result in the termination of approximately 7500 employees and will require
total cash payments of 373 million of which approximately 74 million has been
spent through december 31 2001 substantially all of the closures will be
completed by the end of 2002

     the integration of nabisco into the operations of the company will also
result in the closure or reconfiguration of several of the companys existing
facilities the aggregate charges to the companys consolidated statement of
earnings to close or reconfigure its facilities and integrate nabisco are
estimated to be in the range of 200 million to 300 million during 2001 the
company incurred pretax integration costs of 53 million for site
reconfigurations and other consolidation programs in the united

                                        2

states in october 2001 the company announced that it was offering a voluntary
retirement program to certain salaried employees in the united states the
program is expected to terminate approximately 750 employees and will result in
an estimated pretax charge of approximately 140 million upon final employee
acceptance in the first quarter of 2002 this pretax charge is part of the
previously discussed 200 million to 300 million in pretax charges related to
the integration of nabisco for a detailed discussion of the nabisco
acquisition see note 5 to the companys consolidated financial statements
incorporated herein by reference to the 2001 annual report

     by combining nabiscos operations with the operations of kraft foods north
america and kraft foods international the company achieved net cost synergies
of over 100 million in 2001 and expects to generate net cost synergies of 300
million in 2002 475 million in 2003 and ongoing annual cost savings of 600
million thereafter

other acquisitions and divestitures

are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of their business

from government subsidies products of kraft foods north america and kraft foods
international also compete with generic products and privatelabel products of
food retailers wholesalers and cooperatives kraft foods north america kraft
foods international and their subsidiaries compete primarily on the basis of
product quality brand recognition brand loyalty service marketing

     kraft foods north america kraft foods international and their subsidiaries
are major purchasers of milk cheese nuts green coffee beans cocoa corn
products wheat rice pork poultry beef vegetable oil and sugar and other
sweeteners they also use significant quantities of glass plastic and cardboard
to package their products they continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost
trends of these commodities to enable them to take appropriate action to obtain
ingredients and packaging needed for production

     kraft foods north america kraft foods international and their subsidiaries
purchase a substantial portion of their milk requirements from independent
agricultural cooperatives and individual producers and a substantial portion of
their cheese requirements from independent sources the prices for milk and
other dairy product purchases are substantially influenced by government
programs as well as by market supply and demand dairy commodity costs on
average have been higher in 2001 than those seen in 2000

     the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans
which are purchased on world markets green coffee bean prices are affected by
the quality and availability of supply trade agreements among producing and
consuming nations the unilateral policies of the producing nations changes in
the value of the united states dollar in relation to certain other currencies
and consumer demand for coffee products in 2001 coffee bean prices have been
lower than in 2000 a significant cost item in chocolate confectionery products
is cocoa which is purchased on world markets and the price of which is
affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in the value of
the british pound sterling and the united states dollar relative to certain
other currencies in 2001 cocoa bean prices have been higher than in 2000

     the prices paid for raw materials and agricultural materials used in the
products of kraft foods north america and kraft foods international generally
reflect external factors such as weather conditions commodity market
fluctuations currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural
programs although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to
fluctuate as a result of these factors the company believes such raw materials
to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources however
the company and its subsidiaries use hedging techniques to minimize the impact
of price fluctuations in their principal raw materials they do not fully hedge
against changes in commodity prices and these strategies may not protect the
company or its subsidiaries from increases in specific raw material costs

that it may be subject to an enforcement action for alleged past violations of
the companys wastewater discharge permit at its production facility in
farmdale ohio the state has offered to attempt to negotiate a settlement of
this matter and the company has accepted the offer to do so the state has not

the state of missouri alleged that the company had violated state solid waste
and clean water laws in its handling of spent wiener casings the company paid a
civil penalty of 300000 and completed remediation of the site where the spent

20 homes downgradient from the site were connected to public drinking water in
the mid1980s after solvents were detected in their individual wells since
1996 three toxic tort cases have been brought against nabisco in new york state
court collectively by or on behalf of approximately 80 individuals including
17 minors the first case was filed on march 6 1996 in the supreme court of
the state of new york and was subsequently dismissed by the trial court that
decision was affirmed on appeal the other two cases both were filed on january
3 2000 also in the supreme court of the state of new york that court granted
defendants summary judgment motion as to all but one of the plaintiffs in each
of the remaining cases and the plaintiffs have now withdrawn their appeal of
this ruling discovery is proceeding as to the two remaining plaintiffs who are
seeking unspecified damages for alleged personal injury and fear or risk of
cancer

     the company is also potentially liable for certain environmental matters
arising from nabiscos or a former affiliates connection with del monte
corporation in the 1970s and 1980s del monte corporation operated a plantation
on oahu hawaii which used various pesticides for crop application over an
extended time period a pesticide spill at the site led to the closure of nearby
drinking water wells and an investigation under the oversight of the united
states environmental protection agency epa of soil and groundwater
contamination associated with the site upon completion of this investigation
the epa will select a plan to remedy the contamination

     in addition two lawsuits were filed in 1999 against del monte corporation
and approximately six other oahu growers and pesticide manufacturers seeking
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for alleged pesticide
contamination of drinking water supplies the board of water supply of the city
and county of honolulu filed the first lawsuit on september 27 1999 in the
circuit court of the first circuit of the state of hawaii this case was settled
and dismissed by the court in january 2002 the second lawsuit which was filed
on october 7 1999 in the same court was brought by numerous area residents
alleging bodily injury emotional distress and wrongful death this case remains
pending in june 2001 the company entered into an agreement with a third party
under which the third party will fully indemnify the company for the hawaii

monte corporation on approximately february 21 2002 the complaints allege that
del monte corporation purchased dbcp in mid1979 with the objective of using it
in nicaragua the lawsuits which were instituted between september 17 2001 and
october 1 2001 with the third civil district judge for managua nicaragua
