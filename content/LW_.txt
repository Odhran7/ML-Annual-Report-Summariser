​ 

raw materials 

​ 

our primary raw materials are potatoes edible oils packaging grains starches and energy inputs we source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic longterm grower relationships and shortterm annual contracts in the us most of the potato crop used in our products is grown in washington idaho and oregon for lwm 

european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands austria belgium germany france and the united kingdom we also have potato growing regions in canada china australia and argentina that support our processing facilities in those countries we believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs yeartoyear we source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers and we source packaging and energy inputs through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types

​ 

the prices paid for these raw materials as well as other raw materials used in making our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs the prices of raw materials can fluctuate as a result of these factors

​ 

during fiscal 2022 we faced increased costs for our primary raw materials including potatoes edible oils packaging grains starches and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through longterm relationships contract strategies and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists as well as through our pricing and productivity initiatives see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of this form 10k for further discussion

​ 

seasonality 

​ 

our product contribution margin percentage inventory levels net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality in general our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter reflecting the cost benefit of freshlyharvested potatoes we typically harvest potatoes in the pacific northwest of the us in july through october which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter while the quality of potatoes affects production 

efficiency overall freshlyharvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs we typically hold 50 to 60 days of finished goods inventory on a firstinfirstout basis so the costs incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest which are generally favorable will flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter requiring more working capital at that time in general net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns

​ 

due to severe impacts of the government mandated shutdowns in response to covid19 seasonal variation in the demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2021 differed from prior years

​ 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us although the risks are organized by heading and each risk is described separately many of the risks are interrelated while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future

​ 

business and operating risks 

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by inflationary pressures increased costs disruption of supply or interruptions or other constraints in the availability of key commodities and other necessary services 

​ 

a significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as raw potatoes edible oil grains starches and energy these commodities are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors including changes in global supply and demand weather conditions including any potential effects of climate change fire natural disasters such as a hurricane tornado earthquake wildfire or flooding disease or pests agricultural uncertainty water stress health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic governmental incentives and controls including importexport restrictions such as new or increased tariffs sanctions quotas or trade barriers including the financial and economic sanctions imposed by the us and certain foreign governments in response to the war in ukraine limited or sole sources of supply inflation political uncertainties acts of terrorism governmental instability war or currency exchange rates despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet demand for our products certain ingredients and packaging including edible oils grains starches and other commodities have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by shortages due to the covid19 pandemic global supply chain disruptions and the war in ukraine although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue in the near future 

​ 

recently the costs of labor raw materials energy fuel packaging materials and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased for example due to reduced availability of trucking capacity and shipping containers global supply chain issues labor shortages and inflation we have experienced increases in transportation and warehousing costs additionally we expect to face continued industrywide cost inflation for various inputs including commodities ingredients packaging materials other raw materials transportation warehousing and labor commodity price increases or a sustained interruption or other constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities including necessary services such as transportation and warehousing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our attempts to offset these cost pressures such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products may not be successful higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume to the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner andor if they result in significant decreases in sales volume our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

​ 

we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost 

structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative functions however gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time in addition there is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the us although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases as a result the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend to the extent we are unable to offset present and future cost increases our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

in addition we may have significant supply chain disruptions due to a number of factors outside of our control including public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic labor shortages increased fuel costs and the war in ukraine which have disrupted production and increased transportation and warehousing costs these factors may lead to our inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner which have led and could lead to increased warehouse and other storage costs our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs or the occurrence of a significant supply chain disruption or the inability to access or deliver products could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position or otherwise harm our business

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the war in ukraine 

​ 

the global economy has been negatively impacted by increasing tensions related to the war in ukraine such adverse and uncertain economic conditions have caused and may continue to cause supply chain disruptions and increased costs for transportation energy and raw materials including edible oil grains and starches furthermore the us and certain foreign governments have imposed financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in russia we are monitoring the conflict and the potential impact of financial and economic sanctions on the regional and global economy in addition some of our customers including our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation have exited from russia further in may 2022 our lwm joint venture announced its intent to withdraw from its joint venture that operates a production facility in russia  as a result lwm determined that its net investment in the joint venture was impaired and wroteoff its investment in russia our portion of the noncash impairment charge was 627 million 

​ 

increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade also could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations though lwm intends to exit the russian market the destabilizing effects of the war in ukraine could have other effects on our business further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to military conflict could result in loss of property expropriation cyberattacks supply disruptions plant closures and an inability to obtain key supplies and materials as well as adversely affect our business and our supply chain our international subsidiaries and joint ventures business partners or customers in the broader region including our european growing regions for potatoes prior to the war in ukraine ukraine was one of the largest exporters of sunflower oil which we use for our products supply chains that were already disrupted by the covid19 pandemic have been further impacted by the war in ukraine which has caused shortages in some raw materials including sunflower oil and higher prices for substitute ingredients such as other edible oils lwm operates processing facilities in europe including austria the netherlands and the united kingdom in many instances these sites depend on the availability of natural gas for use in the production of products which may originate from russia destabilizing effects that military conflict may pose for the european continent or the global oil and natural gas markets could adversely impact lwm’s ability to operate these facilities in addition the effects of military conflict could heighten many of our other risks described in this form 10k

​ 

pandemics or other contagious outbreaks and government actions taken in response thereto may adversely impact and in the case of the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted and are likely to continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the ultimate impact that the covid19 pandemic and any future pandemic or other contagious outbreak will have on our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain while vaccines are more widely available the presence of new variants and increasing case figures in many countries create continued uncertainty about the duration 

and extent of the impact from the pandemic the efforts by governmental and regulatory authorities worldwide to control the spread of covid19 and variants of the virus have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines travel bans shutdowns and shelterinplace or stayathome orders although covid19related restrictions have generally been loosened or lifted these restrictions and measures and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers vendors joint ventures and other business partners have affected and are continuing to affect our business and operations some of the impacts our business has experienced is continuing to experience and may experience as a result of the covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic or other contagious outbreak include but are not limited to the following ​ 

 ​ 

these impacts have caused and may continue to cause changes in the mix of products sold decreases in revenue and increases in costs resulting in decreased profitability and cash flows from operations which have caused and may continue to cause an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations that may be material in addition resurgences of covid19 variants after restrictions are lifted could cause governments to impose new or stricter closures and limits on capacity or social distancing requirements these restrictions could cause consumer demand for food away from home to decline covid19 has disrupted and the spread of future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks may also disrupt our customers suppliers vendors and joint venture and other business partners and each of their financial conditions any material adverse effect on these parties could adversely impact us in this regard the potential duration and impacts of pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic including the emergence and spread of covid19 variants and the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines in the markets where we operate on the global economy and on our business financial condition and results of operations are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty the pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets labor shortages supply chain interruptions increased commodity costs inflation and economic uncertainty which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so 

​ 

the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this form 10k the ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including the emergence and spread of variants the 

continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict any of these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

labor shortages or stoppages an inability to attract and retain key personnel increased turnover or increases in labor and pension costs could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

labor is a primary component of operating our business a number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs including high employment levels federal unemployment subsidies including unemployment benefits offered in response to the covid19 pandemic and other government regulations the labor market has become increasingly tight and competitive and we may face sudden and unforeseen challenges in the availability of labor such as we have experienced during fiscal 2022 at some of our production facilities which reduced our production runrates and increased our manufacturing costs a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our workforce caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors have led and could in the future lead to production or shipping delays increased costs such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our production and distribution facilities and overall business further our success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience as well as finance marketing and other senior management professionals the loss of the services of these persons could deplete our institutional knowledge and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the market for these employees is competitive and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business if we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a highlevel develop adequate training and succession plans for leadership positions or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability such as overtime and thirdparty outsourcing have unintended negative effects our business could be adversely affected similarly we have been negatively impacted and may in the future continue to be negatively impacted by labor shortages or increased labor costs experienced by our thirdparty business partners including our logistics providers suppliers and customers for example reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers an overall labor shortage lack of skilled labor increased turnover or labor inflation caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

in addition health care workers’ compensation postretirement welfare and pension costs are increasing inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could continue to increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the us and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements

​ 

changes in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us 

​ 

we expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers in some instances we have entered into longterm agreements with growers however a portion of our potato needs are sourced on an annual contracted basis to the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our longterm growers contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities to obtain sufficient potato supply we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected or forgo sales to some market segments which would reduce our profitability if we forgo sales to such market segments we may lose customers and may not be able to regain or replace them later

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations including foreign currency risks and trade barriers 

​ 

we conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the us including through our joint ventures during each of fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 net sales outside the us primarily in australia canada china japan korea mexico and taiwan accounted for approximately 17 of our net sales these amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures which are also subject to risks associated with international operations

​ 

many factors relating to our domestic and international sales and operations many of which are outside of our control have had and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations including

 ​ 

any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

changes in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us 

​ 

we maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments customers include global national and regional quick service and fast casual restaurants as well as small independently operated restaurants multinational broadline foodservice distributors regional foodservice distributors and major food retailers some of these customers 

independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales in addition we depend on foodservice distributors to help us create endcustomer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue the foodservice distributors also sell products that compete with our products and we sometimes need to reduce prices or provide rebates and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products 

​ 

our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation accounted for approximately 10 of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2022 there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the financial condition of our significant customers including restaurants distributors and retailers are affected by events that are largely beyond our control such as the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and possible future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks and political or military conflicts such as the war in ukraine specifically some customers including mcdonald’s corporation have exited from russia deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

disruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

to serve our customers globally we rely in part on our international joint ventures but also on exports from the us during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 export sales from the us accounted for approximately 12 13 and 16 respectively of our total net sales circumstances beyond our control such as a labor dispute at a port or workforce disruption including those due to the covid19 pandemic or future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities during the latter half of fiscal 2022 limited shipping container availability along the us west coast and disruptions to ocean freight networks across the pacific ocean resulted in lower export volumes in our global segment we have access to production outside of the us through our facilities in australia canada and china and joint ventures in argentina and europe but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms if this occurs we may be unable to adequately supply all of our existing customers’ needs and new customer opportunities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

our operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties 

​ 

the success of our endtoend supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties suppliers copackers thirdparty outsourcers warehousing partners and transportation providers are among our critical partners although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all it is possible that events beyond our control such as operational failures labor issues cybersecurity events global geopolitical conflict such as the war in ukraine pandemics or other health issues such as covid19 or other issues could impact our third parties if our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments introduce unplanned risk to our operations eg through cyber activity or are unable to fulfill their obligations we could experience manufacturing challenges shipment delays increased costs or lost revenue which could also impact our relationships with customers and our brand image 

​ 

in addition to our own production facilities we source a portion of our products under copacking agreements the success of our business depends in part on maintaining a strong sourcing and manufacturing platform we believe that there are a limited number of competent highquality copackers in the industry and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative copacking agreements or arrangements in the future we can provide no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner our inability to enter into satisfactory copacking agreements could limit our ability to implement our business plan or meet customer demand

​ 

damage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

our customers rely on us and our comanufacturers to manufacture safe high quality food products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may damage the reputation of our customers and ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions

​ 

our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for our operations and activities including the health safety and security of our employees our research and development efforts our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management our failure to comply with local laws and regulations our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

if we are unable to execute on large capital projects complete potential acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives or integrate acquired businesses our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

demand for frozen potato products is growing and we believe that this demand will continue to grow over the longterm to support our customers’ growth we believe we must invest in our production capabilities either through capital expansion or acquisitions in 2021 we announced capital investments in a new french fry processing line in american falls idaho and a new french fry processing facility in china if we are unable to complete these or other large capital projects or encounter unexpected delays higher costs or other challenges including those related to supply chain disruptions and availability of necessary labor materials and equipment our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

in addition from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include i diversion of management attention from existing businesses ii difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems iii difficulties implementing effective control environment processes iv adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers v inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings vi potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and vii indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers if we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects such as new production lines or facilities our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

a portion of our business is and several of our growth strategies are conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit 

​ 

we have built our company in part through the creation of joint ventures some of which we do not control in these relationships we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners rather than our exclusive benefit through our extensive experience in operating a portion of our business through joint ventures we understand that joint ventures often require additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decisionmaking if our joint venture partners take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture or disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those actions or decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted in addition we and our respective partners may be liable for certain obligations or liabilities of the joint ventures as a result we may be subject to additional obligations or liabilities over which we may not have complete control

our substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

​ 

we have incurred substantial indebtedness as of may 29 2022 we had 27280 million of longterm debt including current portion recorded on our consolidated balance sheet our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

​ 

 ​ 

the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business 

​ 

the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability to 

 ​ 

these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities 

​ 

various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations also the limitations imposed by these financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing

​ 

in addition the restrictive covenants in our credit agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these ratios and tests our ability to continue to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond our control a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments including as a result of cross default provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders thereunder to cease making loans to us upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit such action by the lenders could cause crossdefaults under our senior notes indentures 

​ 

any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs

​ 

technology risks 

​ 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

​ 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to our adoption of flexible workfromhome policies for functional support areas which in turn has heightened our vulnerability to cyberattacks or other disruptions despite careful security and controls design implementation and updating independent thirdparty verification and annual training of employees on information security and data protection our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to among other things damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks and other public health crises fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses ransomware and malware hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes while we have experienced threats to our data and systems to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach to our systems however third parties including our partners and vendors could also be a source of security risk to us or cause disruptions to our normal operations in the event of a breach of their own products components networks security systems and infrastructure for example in december 2021 our thirdparty service provider for our workforce management software the ultimate kronos group “ kronos ” experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in kronos temporarily decommissioning the functionality of certain of its cloud software requiring us to find and implement other procedures to continue our payroll processes which was time consuming and burdensome but did not have a material adverse impact on our business in addition over time and particularly recently as evidenced by the attack on kronos the sophistication of the cyber threats continues to increase sophisticated cybersecurity threats including potential cyberattacks from russia targeted against the us pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems including cloudbased platforms in addition new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers or suppliers misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations potentially significant fines and penalties damage to our reputation and credibility loss of strategic opportunities and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may face business interruptions litigation and financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or customers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

​ 

problems with the transition design or implementation of our new erp system could interfere with our business and operations and adversely affect our financial condition 

​ 

we are in the process of building a new erp system to replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business the erp system implementation process has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources due to the uncertainty caused by covid19 we paused erp work in fiscal 2021 after completing the first phase of implementation we recently resumed designing the next phase of our erp implementation and are in the build stage we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties as we transition to new upgraded systems and business processes these difficulties have and may include loss of data difficulty in making payments to thirdparties difficulty in completing financial reporting and filing reports with the sec in a timely manner or challenges in otherwise running our business we may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the transition design and implementation of a new erp system particularly any disruptions delays or deficiencies that impact our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we do not encounter adverse effects the transition design and implementation of a new erp system may be much more costly than we anticipated 

​ 

industry risks 

​ 

our business is affected by potato crop performance 

​ 

our primary input is potatoes and every year we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into valueadded products environmental and climate conditions such as soil quality moisture and temperature affect the yield and quality of the potato crop on a yeartoyear basis as a result we source potatoes from specific regions of the us and specific countries abroad including argentina australia austria belgium canada china france germany the netherlands and the united kingdom where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist however severe weather conditions including protracted periods of extreme heat or cold during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance such as the extreme heat in the pacific northwest in the summer of 2021 and the drought in europe during fiscal 2019 both of which resulted in poor crop and significantly limited supply further because of the poor quality of the crop in the pacific northwest that was harvested in fall 2021 we encountered lower raw potato utilization rates in our production facilities during the second half of fiscal 2022 which increased our production costs potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure decreased yields and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes we have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop however if a weather or pestrelated event occurs in a particular crop year and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our existing customers’ needs and new customer opportunities or we may experience manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease alternatively overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and oversupply an increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods and associated increased storage costs or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss

​ 

our business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region 

​ 

ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our valueadded products eg french fries are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally in the us most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in washington idaho and oregon european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in austria belgium germany france the netherlands and the united kingdom recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions but the capitalintensive nature of our industry’s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions noted above unfavorable crop conditions in any one region could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production which occurred in connection with the drought in europe during fiscal 2019 our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet existing customers’ needs and new customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability

the sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

​ 

some of our customers are large and sophisticated with buying power and negotiating strength these customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition some of these customers eg larger distributors and supermarkets have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed and large retail customers may choose to stock their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products this could be exacerbated with a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn and consumers moving to private label or lower priced products if the initiatives we undertake to counteract these pressures including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality are unsuccessful and we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers our profitability could decline 

​ 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

​ 

our business valueadded frozen potato products is highly competitive competitors include large north american and european frozen potato product companies that compete globally local and regional companies and retailers and foodservice distributors with their own branded and private label products some of our competitors are larger and have substantial financial sales and marketing and other resources we compete based on among other things customer service value product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty price and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing increasing spend on promotional activity or losing market share competitive pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

​ 

increased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits 

​ 

in recent years market demand for valueadded frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products as additional industry capacity comes online or market demand otherwise decreases including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices or we may lose market share for example during fiscal 2021 we faced increased pricing pressure for private label products due to excess production capacity in europe that resulted from decreased demand following governmentimposed covidrelated social restrictions which caused us to lose some private label volume our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume

​ 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences and trends 

​ 

consumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences we need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences for example as consumers continue to focus on freshly prepared foods some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens as a result we must evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment in addition our products contain carbohydrates sodium genetically modified ingredients added sugars saturated fats and preservatives the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny we must continue to reformulate our products introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste texture and appearance that consumers demand in valueadded potato products all of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

in addition we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our customers and consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings during an economic downturn factors such as increased unemployment decreases in disposable income inflation and declines in consumer confidence could cause a decrease in demand for our overall product offerings particularly higher priced products which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations distributors restaurants and retailers may also become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

legal and regulatory risks 

​ 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business 

​ 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances which would cause us to incur associated costs those costs could be meaningful we may also be subject to litigation requests for indemnification from our customers or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury illness or death a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

​ 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act the food safety modernization act other laws and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

new regulations imposed by the fda or efsa around acrylamide formation in potato products could adversely affect us 

​ 

the regulation of food products both within the us and internationally continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny the presence andor formation of acrylamide in potato products cooked at high temperatures has become a global regulatory issue as both the fda and the european food safety authority ‘‘efsa’’ have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give ‘‘browned foods’’ their desirable flavor acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet including but not limited to breads toast cookies coffee crackers potatoes and olives the regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control eg temperature and material testing eg low sugar and low asparagine however limits for acrylamide exposure have been established in the state of california and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits in addition the efsa has promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products if the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and 

additional legal limits are established our manufacturing costs could increase in addition if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation sales of our products could decrease 

​ 

if we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

​ 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the us department of agriculture the fda the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to additional costs product detentions substantial delays or a temporary shutdown in manufacturing lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products

​ 

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by foreign government agencies the us environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies which pertain to the protection of human health and the environment including but not limited to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit the emissions of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

​ 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as potatoes and edible oils adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw potatoes lower recoveries of usable raw potatoes increase the prices of our raw potatoes increase our cost of transporting and storing raw potatoes or disrupt our production schedules or efficiencies natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain in addition water is an important part of potato processing in times of water stress we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations further a decrease in the availability of water in certain regions caused by droughts or other factors could increase competition for land and resources in areas that have more favorable growing conditions and thereby increase costs for such land and resources

​ 

the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases as well as more stringent regulation of water rights in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions improve our energy efficiency and reduce and reuse water we may be subject to curtailment or reduced access to resources or experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery in particular increasing regulation of utility providers fuel emissions or fuel suppliers could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs of our products also consumers and customers may place an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting further any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity which could damage our reputation as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations see also “industry risks – our business is affected by potato crop performance” in this item 1a risk factors above

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

​ 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results we also license certain intellectual property most notably grown in idaho and alexia  from third parties to the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted 

​ 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results

​ 

executive summary 

​ 

in fiscal 2022 we delivered a solid financial and operating performance in a highly challenging environment that was characterized by severe input and transportation cost inflation a historically poor potato crop in the pacific northwest and constraints in labor availability and logistics networks we drove strong net sales growth by executing pricing actions and improving product and customer mix these actions along with our supply chain productivity initiatives served to offset some but not all of the cost and operating headwinds that we faced throughout the year specifically compared with the prior year

​ 

 ​ 

compared with fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher pricemix and sales volumes the increase in pricemix reflected the benefit of multiple product pricing actions across each of our business segments to offset input cost inflation as well as higher prices charged for product delivery the increase in sales volumes reflected 

higher shipments to restaurant and foodservice channels in north america as demand continued to rebound towards prepandemic levels the increase was most pronounced in our foodservice segment which has a higher proportion of its sales to onpremise dining establishments while shipments to our large chain quick service restaurant “qsr” and casual dining restaurant customers in the us which are included in our global segment also increased the sales volume increase was partially offset by lower export volumes which are included in our global segment and lower shipments in our retail segment our sales growth was also tempered by widespread industry supply chain constraints that resulted in lower production runrates and throughput in our production facilities

​ 

outside of north america the recovery in frozen potato demand varied and generally lagged us demand shipments to customers in china fell as restaurant traffic and consumer demand was negatively affected by governmentimposed restrictions geared towards reducing the spread of covid19related variants while shipments to other key markets in asia and oceania were negatively affected by global logistics constraints in europe which is served by our lwm joint venture sales volumes increased as restaurant traffic continued to improve although earnings were negatively affected by inflation production and transportation challenges 

​ 

gross profit in fiscal 2022 was flat compared to fiscal 2021 as favorable pricemix offset higher manufacturing and distribution costs on a per pound basis while income from operations declined 304 million to 4444 million as a result of higher selling general and administrative “sga” expenses

​ 

compared to fiscal 2021 net income declined 1169 million to 2009 million while diluted eps declined 078 to 138 most of the declines were due to a 627 million before and aftertax or 043 per share noncash impairment charge associated with lwm’s announced intent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to withdraw from its joint venture in russia in response to the war in ukraine as well as a loss of 533 million 405 million aftertax or 027 per share associated with a transaction to lower the interest rates and extend the maturities on some outstanding debt see liquidity and capital resources below

​ 

we generated fullyear cash from operations of 4181 million and cash flow after investing activities of 1076 million we ended the year with 5250 million of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility in addition we returned 2891 million to our stockholders including 1384 million in cash dividends and 1507 million of share repurchases in july 2022 we used approximately 42 million to acquire an additional forty percent interest in our joint venture in argentina lwamsa increasing our total ownership from fifty percent to ninety percent following the acquisition we will consolidate lwamsa’s results in our consolidated financial statements

​ 

outlook 

​ 

in fiscal 2023 we expect pricemix to increase largely due to pricing actions that we began to implement in fiscal 2022 in an effort to mitigate manufacturing and distribution cost inflation we also expect sales volumes to grow largely due to the expected continuation in the rise of us demand for frozen potato products although our volume growth may be tempered by production capacity and logistics constraints in addition we expect that us restaurant traffic demand and volume growth may be increasingly volatile as consumers respond to the current inflationary environment we expect the rate of recovery of demand in our key international markets will be mixed and that our international shipments will continue to be tempered by limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks

​ 

during the first half of fiscal 2023 we expect our gross margins will be pressured as compared to normalized seasonal rates as we continue to manage through significant inflation as well as higher raw potato costs on a per pound basis due to the impact of extreme summer heat that negatively affected the yield and quality of potato crops in the pacific northwest in the fall of 2021 we also expect our gross margins in the first half of fiscal 2023 will be pressured by ongoing industrywide operational challenges including labor and commodities shortages resulting from volatility in the broader supply chain during the second half of fiscal 2023 we expect our gross margins will improve if the potato crop harvested in fall 2022 is in line with historical averages we continue to successfully implement our pricing actions to offset input and transportation costs inflation and we realize a broad easing of labor and logistics pressures that have been constraining our production and shipments we expect overall sga to be higher as a result of increased compensation and benefits expenses and investments to improve our information technology infrastructure over the longterm including our efforts to design and implement the next phase of a new erp system

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

we have four reportable segments global foodservice retail and other we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment and on a consolidated basis product contribution margin when presented on a consolidated basis is a nongaap financial measure net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance product contribution margin represents net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion “ap” expenses product contribution margin includes advertising and promotion expenses because those expenses are directly associated with the performance of our segments for additional information on our reportable segments and product contribution margin see “nongaap financial measures” below and note 13 segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

fiscal year ended may 29 2022 compared to fiscal year ended may 30 2021 

​ 

net sales and product contribution margin 

​ 

 ​ 

net sales 

​ 

lamb weston’s net sales for fiscal 2022 increased 4280 million or 12 to 40989 million compared with 36709 million in fiscal 2021 pricemix increased 9 primarily reflecting the benefit of pricing actions across each of our business segments to offset input manufacturing and transportation cost inflation as well as favorable mix volume increased 3 reflecting higher shipments to restaurant and foodservice channels in north america partially offset by lower exports due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks as well as lower shipments to retail channels our volume growth was tempered by an inability to fully serve customer demand due to widespread industry supply chain constraints including labor and commodities shortages that resulted in lower production runrates and throughput in our production facilities

​ 

global net sales increased 1527 million or 8 to 20642 million compared with 19115 million in fiscal 2021 pricemix increased 6 and volume increased 2 the benefit of domestic and international product and freight pricing actions to offset inflation as well as favorable mix drove the increase in pricemix a strong increase in sales volumes to north american large qsr and casual dining restaurant chain customers was partially offset by lower export shipments due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks

​ 

foodservice net sales increased 3009 million or 30 to 13182 million compared with 10173 million in fiscal 2021 volume and pricemix each increased 15 the benefits of product and freight pricing actions taken throughout the year to offset inflation as well as favorable mix drove the increase in pricemix the segment’s strong volume growth reflects the progressive recovery in demand in its restaurant and noncommercial channels although growth was tempered by an inability to fully serve customer demand due to widespread industry supply chain constraints including labor shortages that resulted in lower production runrates and throughput in our production facilities

​ 

retail net sales decreased 88 million or 1 to 5946 million compared with 6034 million in fiscal 2021 volume declined 8 while pricemix increased 7 lower shipments of private label products resulting from incremental losses of certain lowmargin business as well as lower shipments of branded products drove the sales volume decline the decline in branded product volume reflected an inability to fully serve customer demand due to lower production runrates and throughput in our production facilities product and freight pricing actions across the branded and private label portfolios to offset inflation as well as improved mix drove the increase in pricemix

​ 

net sales in our other segment declined 168 million or 12 to 1219 million compared with 1387 million in fiscal 2021 the decline primarily reflects lower volume in our vegetable business reflecting the negative effect of the extreme summer heat on the yield and quality of the vegetable crops partially offset by the benefit of pricing actions 

​ 

gross profit and product contribution margin 

​ 

gross profit in fiscal 2022 was flat compared to fiscal 2021 at 8320 million as the benefits from higher pricemix and volume were offset by the impact of higher manufacturing and distribution costs on a per pound basis the higher costs per pound primarily reflected doubledigit cost inflation from key inputs including edible oils ingredients such as grains and starches used in product coatings packaging labor and higher transportation costs the increase in costs per pound also reflected higher raw potato costs due to the impact of extreme summer heat that negatively affected the yield and quality of potato crops in the pacific northwest in fall 2021 the effects of labor and commodities shortages on production runrates as well as lower raw potato utilization rates the increase in per pound costs was partially offset by securing changes to product specifications portfolio simplification and driving supply chain savings behind our win as 1 productivity program gross profit also included a 289 million decrease in unrealized marktomarket adjustments associated with commodity hedging contracts which includes a 95 million loss in the current year compared with a 194 million gain related to these items in the prior year

​ 

lamb weston’s overall product contribution margin in fiscal 2022 declined 11 million to 8131 million compared with 8142 million in fiscal 2021 the decline was largely due to a 11 million increase in ap expenses as gross profit was flat as described above 

​ 

global product contribution margin declined 540 million or 18 to 2522 million in fiscal 2022 higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable pricemix and higher sales volumes global segment cost of sales was 18066 million up 13 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs and higher sales volumes 

​ 

foodservice product contribution margin increased 1093 million or 32 to 4493 million in fiscal 2022 favorable price volume and mix drove the increase and were partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound cost of sales was 8638 million up 28 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs and higher sales volumes 

​ 

retail product contribution margin declined 108 million or 9 to 1094 million in fiscal 2022 higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound and lower sales volumes drove the decline partially offset by favorable pricemix and a 08 million decrease in ap expenses cost of sales was 4771 million up 1 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs partially offset by lower sales volumes 

​ 

other product contribution margin declined 456 million to 22 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to 478 million in fiscal 2021 these amounts include a 104 million loss related to unrealized marktomarket adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2022 and a 278 million gain related to the 

contracts in fiscal 2021 excluding these marktomarket adjustments other segment product contribution margin declined 74 million largely due to higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volumes in our vegetable business

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

​ 

sga expenses were 3876 million up 304 million or 9 in fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense higher travel employee relations and inperson meeting expenses higher information technology infrastructure costs including expenses related to the planning and design of our new erp system and a 35 million contribution to the lamb weston charitable foundation the increase in sga was partially offset by lower consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations

​ 

interest expense net 

​ 

interest expense net was 1610 million in fiscal 2022 an increase of 427 million compared with fiscal 2021 the increase reflects a 533 million 405 million aftertax loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the redemption of our previously outstanding senior notes due 2024 and 2026 excluding this loss interest expense net declined 106 million reflecting a lower weighted average interest rate for more information see note 7 debt and financing obligations of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

our effective tax rate was 263 for fiscal 2022 compared to 222 in fiscal 2021 the difference between our effective tax rates in fiscal 2022 and 2021 is primarily due to the russia impairment charge treated as a nondeductible permanent difference our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory tax rate of 21 principally due to the impact of us state taxes foreign taxes permanent differences and discrete items and was elevated in fiscal 2022 relative to our historical rate due to the russia impairment charge excluding the russia impairment charge our effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 214

​ 

for further information on income taxes see note 3 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

equity method investment earnings loss 

​ 

we conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings loss based on our economic ownership interest in them lamb weston’s share of earnings loss from its equity method investments was a loss of 107 million and earnings of 518 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively equity method investment earnings in fiscal 2022 included a 627 million noncash impairment charge to writeoff our portion of lwm’s net investment in russia resulting from lwm’s announced intent to withdraw from its joint venture in response to the war in ukraine equity method investment earnings also included a 265 million unrealized gain related to marktomarket adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2022 and an 113 million gain related to these items in fiscal 2021 the increase in marktomarket adjustments in 2022 primarily relates to changes in the value of natural gas derivatives at lwm as commodity markets in europe have experienced significant volatility 

​ 

excluding the charge associated with the writeoff of our portion of lwm’s net investment in russia and the marktomarket adjustments earnings from equity method investments decreased 150 million compared to the prior year the decrease reflects input cost inflation and higher manufacturing and distribution costs in both europe and the us partially offset by the benefit of favorable pricemix and higher sales volumes 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

we ended fiscal 2022 with 5250 million of cash and cash equivalents and 9946 million of availability on our revolving credit facility which is net of outstanding letters of credit of 54 million we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital requirements for the next 12 months 

with current cash balances and cash from operations supplemented as necessary by available borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 

​ 

cash flows 

​ 

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating investing and financing activities

​ 

 ​ 

operating activities 

​ 

during fiscal 2022 cash provided by operating activities decreased 1351 million to 4181 million compared to 5532 million for fiscal 2021 the decrease related to 1304 million of cash used for unfavorable changes in working capital and a 47 million decrease in net income adjusted for noncash income and expenses unfavorable changes in working capital primarily related to a decrease in accounts payable due to timing an increase in receivables attributable to higher sales at the end of fiscal 2022 compared with the end of fiscal 2021 and higher finished goods inventories due to increased input costs and global disruption in freight networks these unfavorable changes were partially offset by a favorable change in accrued liabilities which was primarily due to a shift in the timing of accrued interest payments for our senior notes specifically our senior notes due 2030 and 2032 which were issued in fiscal 2022 have payments due in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 whereas the nowredeemed senior notes due 2024 and 2026 had interest payments due in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 see “result of operations” in this mda for more information related to the decrease in income from operations 

​ 

investing activities 

​ 

investing activities used 3105 million of cash in fiscal 2022 compared with 1625 million in fiscal 2021 the increase primarily relates to our concentrated effort in the prior year to control spending during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic to preserve liquidity in addition to maintenance capital expenditures fiscal 2022 also reflected increased investments to support capacity expansion projects in idaho and china 

​ 

we expect capital investments in fiscal 2023 to be approximately 475 million to 525 million depending on timing of projects which include among other items construction of a previously announced french fry production line and plant modernization investments in idaho construction of a greenfield french fry processing facility in china and capital investments to upgrade information systems and erp infrastructure these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions supply chain constraints for equipment and our regulatory compliance requirements at may 29 2022 we had commitments for capital expenditures of 3047 million

​ 

in july 2022 we acquired an additional forty percent interest in our argentina joint venture lwamsa for approximately 42 million increasing our total ownership of lwamsa from fifty percent to ninety percent following this acquisition we will consolidate lwamsa’s results in our consolidated financial statements

​ 

financing activities 

​ 

during fiscal 2022 cash used for financing activities decreased 6106 million to 3634 million compared with 9740 million used during fiscal 2021 during fiscal 2022 financing activities primarily related to issuing us dollardenominated senior notes and a rmbdenominated loan facility for combined net proceeds of 16761 million offset by 16981 million of debt and financing obligation repayments including cash used to redeem our previously outstanding senior notes due 2024 and 2026 including the payment of a call premium of 396 million and the payment of 1384 million of cash dividends to common stockholders in addition we used 1584 million of cash to repurchase 2407184 shares of our common stock at an average price of 6259 and withheld 118204 shares from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the year as of may 29 2022 2689 million remained authorized for repurchase under our share repurchase program 

​ 

during fiscal 2021 we repaid the 4950 million we borrowed under our revolving credit facility at the onset of the pandemic and we repaid 3055 million of other debt and financing obligations including the repayment of the 2719 million term loan facility that was scheduled to mature in november 2021 we also paid 1353 million in cash dividends to common stockholders during fiscal 2021 we repurchased 328918 shares of our common stock at an average price of 7819 and withheld 164992 shares of common stock from employees to cover income and payroll taxes on equity awards that vested during the period

for more information about our debt including among other items interest rates maturity dates and covenants see note 7 debt and financing obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k at may 29 2022 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreements

​ 

investments in joint ventures 

​ 

we conduct some of our business through three unconsolidated joint ventures and account for these investments using equity method accounting for more information about our investments in joint ventures see note 4 equity method investments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

​ 

obligations and commitments 

​ 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements potato supply agreements and unconditional purchase obligations the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available 

​ 

a summary of our material cash requirements for our known contractual obligations as of may 29 2022 are as follows

 ​ 

 ​ 



 ​ 

 ​ 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

​ 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of may 29 2022 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to our trade promotions income taxes and impairment among others we base our estimates on historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

​ 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results these estimates require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors

​ 

we have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date to the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements may be affected

​ 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

​ 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions sales promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives the estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and redemption rates influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories

​ 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products the costs of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability the estimate of trade promotions is inherently difficult due to information limitations as the products move beyond distributors and through the supply chain to operators estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities current and past tradepromotion spending patterns the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs

​ 

the determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer demand for our products promotion participation particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers 

providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event because of the complexity of some of these trade promotions the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from our estimates as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates at may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 we had 412 million and 399 million respectively of accrued trade promotions payable recorded in “accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

we compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled

​ 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes management judgments are required for the following items

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

impairment of longlived assets and equity method investments 

​ 

long lived assets  our manufacturing assets are shared across all reporting segments which are grouped together for longlived asset impairment assessment we review these longlived assets for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable measured by comparing their net book value to the undiscounted projected future cash flows generated by their use impaired assets are recorded at their estimated fair value 

​ 

in evaluating impairment of longlived assets we consider events or changes in circumstances related to market prices physical condition of assets legal actions construction costs future operating cash flows remaining depreciable 

lives and potential asset disposal at may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 we did not identify any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amounts of our assets groups may not be recoverable

​ 

equity method investments  we conduct some of our business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them at may 29 2022 and may 30 2021 we held 50 equity interests in three potato processing joint ventures including lwm lamb weston rdo and lwamsa these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting we are required to assess our equity method investments for otherthantemporary impairment when events or circumstances suggest the carrying amount of the investment may be impaired we perform our assessment of otherthantemporary impairment for each investment individually

​ 

in evaluating otherthantemporary impairment of equity method investments we consider events or changes in circumstances related to investee operating losses investee future cash flows and the ability to retain our investment in the investee in may 2022 in response to the war in ukraine lwm announced its intent to withdraw from its investment in russia and recorded a charge to writeoff its net investment in the market our portion of the noncash impairment charge was 627 million there were no indications of otherthantemporary impairment in any of our other equity method investments

nongaap financial measures 

​ 

to supplement the financial information included in this report we have presented product contribution margin on a consolidated basis adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures adjusted diluted eps and adjusted net income each of which is considered a nongaap financial measure 

​ 

product contribution margin is one of the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance product contribution margin represents net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses product contribution margin includes advertising and promotion expenses because those expenses are directly associated with the performance of our segments our management also uses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures adjusted diluted eps and adjusted net income to evaluate our performance excluding the impact of certain noncash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods we include these nongaap financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when used in conjunction with gaap financial measures is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing our operating performance and underlying prospects these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as alternatives for gaap financial measures these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures the same way these measures are not a substitute for their comparable gaap financial measures such as gross profit net income or diluted earnings per share as applicable and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures

​ 

raw materials 

​ 

our primary raw materials are potatoes edible oils and packaging we source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic longterm grower relationships and shorterterm annual contracts in the united states most of the potato crop used in our products is grown in washington idaho and oregon for lambwestonmeijer european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands austria belgium germany france the united kingdom and russia we also have potato growing regions in canada china australia and argentina that support our processing facilities in those countries we believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs yeartoyear we source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers and we source packaging and energy inputs through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types

​ 

the prices paid for these raw materials as well as other raw materials used in making our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply

​ 

from time to time we have faced increased costs for our primary raw materials and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through longterm relationships contract strategies and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists as well as through our pricing and productivity initiatives

seasonality 

​ 

our product contribution margin percentage inventory levels net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality in general our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter reflecting the cost benefit of freshlyharvested potatoes we typically harvest potatoes in the pacific northwest of the united states in july through october which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter freshlyharvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs we typically hold 50 to 60 days of finished goods inventory on a firstinfirstout basis so the relatively favorable costs primarily incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter requiring more working capital at that time in general net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns

​ 

due to severe impacts of the government mandated shutdowns in response to the covid19 pandemic seasonal variation in the demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 differed from prior years

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us although the risks are organized by heading and each risk is described separately many of the risks are interrelated while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future

​ 

business and operating risks 

​ 

pandemics or other contagious outbreaks and government actions taken in response thereto may adversely impact and in the case of the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted and are likely to continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the ultimate impact that the covid19 pandemic and any future pandemic or other contagious outbreak will have on our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain to date the efforts by national state and local governments worldwide to control the spread of covid19 have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines travel bans shutdowns and shelterinplace or stayathome orders which have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods these restrictions and measures and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers vendors and joint venture and other business partners have affected and are continuing to affect our business and operations some of the impacts our business has experienced is experiencing and may experience as a result of the covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic or other contagious outbreak include but are not limited to the following ​ 



 ​ 

these impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause changes in the mix of products sold decreases in revenue and increases in costs resulting in decreased profitability and cash flows from operations which have caused and are expected to continue to cause an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations that may be material although government restrictions have been reduced or lifted the negative impact on consumer traffic may continue to some degree because restaurants and other foodservice venues may be required to operate at reduced capacities and consumers may fear gathering in public places in addition resurgences of covid19 infections after restrictions are lifted could cause governments to impose new or stricter closures limits on capacity or social distancing requirements these restrictions could cause consumer demand for food away from home to decline while we have experienced increased demand for our retail products that increase in demand cannot entirely offset the decrease in demand from our foodservice customers further retail demand may gradually decline as consumers begin to shift purchases of fries to dining at restaurants as governments lift social restrictions we cannot predict whether and to what extent changes in consumer food purchasing behavior will persist even after the threat of the covid19 pandemic has been eliminated or how those changes would affect our business 

​ 

covid19 has disrupted and the spread of pandemics or other contagious outbreaks may also disrupt our customers suppliers vendors and joint venture and other business partners and each of their financial conditions any material adverse effect on these parties could adversely impact us in this regard the potential duration and impacts of pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and on our business financial condition and results of operations are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty but the pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets increases in levels of unemployment and economic uncertainty which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so these developments have and may continue to lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending demand for our products the ability of our customers to pay our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers 

​ 

the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this form 10k the ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response each of which is uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict any of these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs disruption of supply or interruptions or other constraints in the availability of key commodities and other necessary services 

​ 

a significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as raw potatoes edible oil and energy these commodities are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors including changes in global supply and demand weather conditions including any potential effects of climate change fire natural disasters such as a hurricane tornado earthquake wildfire or flooding disease or pests agricultural uncertainty water stress health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the covid19 pandemic governmental incentives and controls including importexport restrictions such as new or increased tariffs sanctions quotas or trade barriers limited or sole sources of supply political uncertainties acts of terrorism governmental instability or currency exchange rates despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet demand for our products certain ingredients and packaging including edible oils and other commodities have been adversely impacted by shortages during the covid19 pandemic although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future we expect these supply pressures to continue in the near future in addition we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products due to disruptions related to covid19 in our production facilities we have experienced increases in transportation and warehousing costs commodity price increases or a sustained interruption or other constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities including necessary services such as transportation and warehousing have increased and may continue to increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations during fiscal 2021 as a result of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we were not able to and in the future we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and decreased profitability 

there is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the united states although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases as a result the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend

​ 

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative functions however gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time 

​ 

in addition we may have significant supply chain disruptions due to a number of factors outside of our control including public health crises such as the covid19 pandemic which has disrupted production and increased transportation and warehousing costs these factors may lead to our inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner which have led and could lead to in the future increased warehouse and other storage costs our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs or the occurrence of a significant supply chain disruption or the inability to access or deliver products could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position or otherwise harm our business

​ 

changes in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us 

​ 

we expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers in some instances we have entered into longterm agreements with growers however a large portion of our potato needs are typically sourced on an annual contracted basis to the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our longterm growers contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities to obtain sufficient potato supply we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected or forgo sales to some market segments which would reduce our profitability if we forgo sales to such market segments we may lose customers and may not be able to regain or replace them later

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations including foreign currency risks and trade barriers 

​ 

we conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the united states including through our joint ventures during each of fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 net sales outside the united states primarily in australia canada china japan korea mexico and taiwan accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales these amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures which are also subject to risks associated with international operations

​ 

many factors relating to our domestic and international sales and operations many of which are outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations including



 ​ 

any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

changes in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us 

​ 

we maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments customers include global national and regional quick service and fast casual restaurants as well as small independently operated restaurants multinational broadline foodservice distributors regional foodservice distributors and major food retailers some of these customers independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales in addition we depend on foodservice distributors to help us create endcustomer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue the foodservice distributors also sell products that compete with our products and we sometimes need to reduce prices or provide rebates and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products while we contract annually or biannually with many of our foodservice customers the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially impact our business 

​ 

our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation accounted for approximately 11 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 and 10 of our consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2020 and 2019 there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the financial condition of our significant customers including restaurants distributors and retailers are affected by events that are largely beyond our control such as the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and possible future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

disruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

to serve our customers globally we rely in part on our international joint venture partnerships but also on exports from the united states during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 export sales from the united states accounted for approximately 13 16 and 16 respectively of our total net sales circumstances beyond our control such as a labor dispute at a port or workforce disruption due to the covid19 pandemic or future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities we have access to production outside of the united states through our facilities in australia canada and china and joint ventures in argentina and europe but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms if this occurs we may be unable to adequately supply all of our existing customers’ needs and new customer opportunities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties 

​ 

the success of our endtoend supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties suppliers copackers thirdparty outsourcers warehousing partners and transportation providers are among our critical partners although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all it is possible that events beyond our control such as operational failures labor issues cybersecurity events pandemics or other health issues such as covid19 or other issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties if our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments introduce unplanned risk to our operations eg through cyber activity or are unable to fulfill their obligations we could experience manufacturing challenges shipment delays increased costs or lost revenue which could also impact our relationships with customers and our brand image 

​ 

in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we source a portion of our products under copacking agreements the success of our business depends in part on maintaining a strong sourcing and manufacturing platform we believe that there are a limited number of competent highquality copackers in the industry and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative copacking agreements or arrangements in the future we can provide no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner our inability to enter into satisfactory copacking agreements could limit our ability to implement our business plan or meet customer demand

​ 

a portion of our business is and several of our growth strategies are conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit 

​ 

we have built our company in part through the creation of joint ventures some of which we do not control in these relationships we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners rather than our exclusive benefit through our extensive experience in operating a portion of our business through joint ventures we understand that joint ventures often require additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decisionmaking if our joint venture partners take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture or disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those actions or decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted

​ 

damage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

our customers rely on us and our comanufacturers to manufacture safe high quality food products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may damage the reputation of our customers and ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions

​ 

our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for our operations and activities including the health safety and security of our employees our research and development efforts our 

environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management our failure to comply with local laws and regulations our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience as well as finance marketing and other senior management professionals the loss of the services of these persons could deplete our institutional knowledge and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the market for these employees is competitive and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business if we do not succeed in retaining our current employees attracting new highquality employees and developing adequate training and succession plans for leadership positions our business could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

if we are unable to complete potential acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives integrate acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include i diversion of management attention from existing businesses ii difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems iii difficulties implementing effective control environment processes iv adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers v inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings vi potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and vii indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers if we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects such as new production lines or facilities our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

​ 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

​ 

our substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

​ 

we have incurred substantial indebtedness as of may 30 2021 we had 27374 million of longterm debt including current portion recorded on our consolidated balance sheet our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

​ 



 ​ 

the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business 

​ 

the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability to 

 ​ 

these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities 

​ 

various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations also the limitations imposed by these financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing

​ 

in addition the restrictive covenants in our credit agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these ratios and tests our ability to continue to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond our control a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments including as a result of cross default provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders thereunder to cease making loans to us upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit such action by the lenders could cause crossdefaults under our senior notes indentures 

​ 

any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs further under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with conagra at the spinoff we may not retire repurchase or significantly modify our senior notes due 2024 and 2026 during the fiveyear period following the spinoff which period ends on november 9 2021

​ 

technology risks 

​ 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

​ 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers the importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic which in turn has heightened our vulnerability to cyberattacks or other disruptions despite careful security and controls design implementation and updating independent thirdparty verification and regular training of employees on information security and data protection our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to among other things damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks and other public health crises fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses ransomware and malware hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes while we have experienced threats to our data and systems to date we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach however over time and particularly recently the sophistication of these threats continues to increase sophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems including cloudbased platforms in addition new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyberattacks if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers or suppliers 

​ 

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations potentially significant fines and penalties damage to our reputation and credibility loss of strategic opportunities and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may face business interruptions litigation and financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or customers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

​ 

problems with the transition design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business and operations and adversely affect our financial condition 

​ 

we are in the process of implementing a new erp system to replace our existing operating and financial systems the erp system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business the erp system implementation process has required and will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources while we have completed the first phase of our new erp system implementation we paused subsequent phases due to the uncertainty caused by covid19 we are preparing to resume the next phase of the erp implementation in fiscal 2022 we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties as we transition to new upgraded systems and processes 

these difficulties have and may include loss of data difficulty in making payments to thirdparties difficulty in completing financial reporting and filing reports with the sec in a timely manner or challenges in otherwise running our business we may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the transition design and implementation of a new erp system particularly any disruptions delays or deficiencies that impact our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we do not encounter adverse effects the transition design and implementation of a new erp system may be much more costly than we anticipated 

​ 

industry risks 

​ 

our business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region 

​ 

ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our valueadded products eg french fries are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally in the united states most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in washington idaho and oregon european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in austria belgium germany france the netherlands russia and the united kingdom recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions but the capitalintensive nature of our industry’s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions noted above unfavorable crop conditions in any one region could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production which occurred in connection with the drought in europe during fiscal 2019 our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet existing customers’ needs and new customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability

​ 

our business is affected by potato crop performance 

​ 

our primary input is potatoes and every year we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into valueadded products environmental and climate conditions such as soil quality moisture and temperature affect the yield and quality of the potato crop on a yeartoyear basis as a result we source potatoes from specific regions of the united states and specific countries abroad including australia austria belgium canada china france germany the netherlands russia and the united kingdom where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist however severe weather conditions including protracted periods of extreme heat or cold during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance such as the drought in europe during our fiscal year 2019 that resulted in poor crop and significantly limited supply potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure decreased yields and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes we have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop however if a weather or pestrelated event occurs in a particular crop year and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our existing customers’ needs and new customer opportunities and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease alternatively overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and oversupply an increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods and associated increased storage costs or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss

​ 

the sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

​ 

some of our customers are large and sophisticated with buying power and negotiating strength these customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition some of these customers eg larger distributors and supermarkets have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed and large retail customers may choose to stock their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products this could be exacerbated with a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn and consumers moving to private label or lower priced products if the initiatives we undertake to counteract these pressures including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality are unsuccessful and we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers our profitability could decline 

​ 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

​ 

our business valueadded frozen potato products is highly competitive competitors include large north american and european frozen potato product companies that compete globally local and regional companies and retailers and foodservice distributors with their own branded and private label products some of our competitors are larger and have substantial financial sales and marketing and other resources we compete based on among other things customer service value product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty price and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing increasing spend on promotional activity or losing market share for example private label pricing has become more competitive recently as european competitors have increased their presence in the united states as they leverage their excess production capacity due to decreased demand following governmentimposed covidrelated social restrictions competitive pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

​ 

increased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits 

​ 

in recent years market demand for valueadded frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products as additional industry capacity comes online or market demand otherwise decreases including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices or we may lose market share for example during fiscal 2021 we faced increased pricing pressure for private label products due to excess production capacity in europe that resulted from decreased demand following governmentimposed covidrelated social restrictions our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume

​ 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences and trends 

​ 

consumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences we need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences for example as consumers focus on freshly prepared foods some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens as a result we must evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment in addition our products contain carbohydrates sodium genetically modified ingredients added sugars saturated fats and preservatives the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny we must continue to reformulate our products introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste texture and appearance that consumers demand in valueadded potato products all of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

in addition we compete against branded products as well as private label products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our customers and consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors’ products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer private label products which are typically sold at lower prices then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings during an economic downturn factors such as increased unemployment decreases in disposable income and declines in consumer confidence could cause a decrease in demand for our overall product offerings particularly higher priced products which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations distributors restaurants and retailers may also become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

legal and regulatory risks 

​ 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business 

​ 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances which would cause us to incur associated costs those costs could be meaningful we may also be subject to litigation requests for indemnification from our customers or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury illness or death a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

​ 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act the food safety modernization act other laws and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

new regulations imposed by the fda or efsa around acrylamide formation in potato products could adversely affect us 

​ 

the regulation of food products both within the united states and internationally continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny the presence andor formation of acrylamide in potato products cooked at high temperatures has become a global regulatory issue as both the fda and the european food safety authority ‘‘efsa’’ have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give ‘‘browned foods’’ their desirable flavor acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet including but not limited to breads toast cookies coffee crackers potatoes and olives the regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control eg temperature and material testing eg low sugar and low asparagine however limits for acrylamide exposure have been established in the state of california and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits in addition the efsa has promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products if the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and additional legal limits are established our manufacturing costs could increase in addition if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation sales of our products could decrease 

​ 

if we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

​ 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the us department of agriculture the fda the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to additional costs product detentions substantial delays or a temporary shutdown in manufacturing lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by foreign government agencies the us environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies which pertain to the protection of human health and the environment including but not limited to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit the emissions of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

​ 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as potatoes and edible oils in addition water is an important part of potato processing in times of water stress we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations further a decrease in the availability of water in certain regions caused by droughts or other factors could increase competition for land and resources in areas that have more favorable growing conditions and thereby increase costs for such land and resources

​ 

the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases as well as more stringent regulation of water rights in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions improve our energy efficiency and reduce and reuse water we may be subject to curtailment or reduced access to resources or experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

​ 

our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands 

​ 

we consider our intellectual property rights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark patent copyright and trade secret protection contractual agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results we also license certain intellectual property most notably grown in idaho and alexia  from third parties to the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted 

​ 

competing intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development launch and sale of certain products any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results

​ 

litigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we are or may become party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability product recalls product liability product claims 

employment matters environmental matters intellectual property or other aspects of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

general risks 

​ 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

​ 

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected for example during fiscal 2019 we identified a material weakness in internal control related to information technology general controls and as a result concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of may 26 2019 although we implemented remedial measures and concluded the material weakness had been remediated as of may 31 2020 there is no assurance these remedial measures will continue to be effective or that we may not later identify other material weaknesses in internal controls the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline

​ 

executive summary 

​ 

in fiscal 2021 we navigated the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our operations and global frozen potato demand demonstrating the strength and resilience of our employees in a challenging environment throughout the pandemic our primary focus and attention has been directed towards the health and wellbeing of our employees and contractors while continuing to support our customers and to invest in our manufacturing supply chain commercial and information technology operations to meet our longterm strategic objectives 

our fiscal 2021 financial performance reflects the negative impact on frozen potato demand in our foodawayfromhome sales channels while demand and shipment trends sequentially improved during the year in our foodawayfromhome sales channels shipments to restaurants and other foodservice outlets were below prepandemic levels the pandemic also significantly disrupted manufacturing and distribution operations across all industries including ours which resulted in higher costs as a result our sales and earnings in fiscal 2021 declined as compared to fiscal 2020 which included the benefit of an additional week “53 rd week” of sales earnings and cash flow specifically

​ 

 ​ 

compared with fiscal 2020 the decline in net sales was driven by lower sales volume our sales volume declined largely due to demand for frozen potato products outside the home falling after governmentimposed social restrictions to slow the spread of covid19 reduced restaurant traffic and included restrictions for onpremise dining the decline in sales volume was most pronounced in our foodservice segment which has a higher proportion of its sales to onpremise dining establishments including independent restaurants and noncommercial operations such as lodging and hospitality healthcare schools and universities sports and entertainment and workplace environments the decline in sales volumes in our global segment was less pronounced as consumers leveraged drivethru carryout and delivery options at quick service restaurants in the us in our retail segment which sells products for foodathome consumption sales volume for our branded products was strong but this was more than offset by lower sales volume of private label products resulting from losses of certain lowmargin business overall our sales volume decline was partially offset by higher pricemix which was largely due to favorable pricing in our foodservice segment and favorable mix in our retail segment while pricemix in our global segment was flat

​ 

in europe which is served by our lambwestonmeijer joint venture sales volumes also declined as demand fell following governmentimposed social restrictions although a high percentage of our sales are to quick service restaurants unlike the us most consumption in europe is dinein or carryout as drivethru options are more limited as a result the effect of governmentimposed restrictions on french fry demand in europe was similar to what we observed for fullservice restaurants operations in the us 

​ 

overall international sales volumes which are included in our global segment varied by market while demand in many of our key markets improved as fiscal 2021 progressed the rate of improvement generally lagged that in the us in addition our exports were hindered by pandemicrelated congestion at us west coast ports as well as the availability of shipping containers

​ 

income from operations declined due to lower sales higher manufacturing and distribution costs and higher selling general and administrative “sga” expenses  the increase in costs was largely due to incremental costs resulting from the pandemic’s disruptive effect on our production transportation and warehousing operations including costs to address the safety and welfare of our employees and costs associated with a tighter labor market due to covid19 related absenteeism and laborrelated restrictions the covid19 environment also caused freight rates to increase due to tighter capacity and stronger demand in the trucking and cargo container markets resulting from higher shipping volume of products we also experienced higher input cost inflation particularly for edible oils because of low supply as well as higher demand for raw materials by alternative end markets such as biofuels despite these challenges we continued to invest in our supply chain operations and completed the initial phase of our new erp system which we expect will benefit our operations over the long term we also announced capital expansions in the us and china and with our joint venture in europe announced expansions in russia and the netherlands 

​ 

we generated fullyear cash from operations of 5532 million and cash flow after investing activities including information technology initiatives of 3907 million given the significant economic uncertainty we took prudent and early actions to reinforce and enhance our financial strength see “liquidity and capital resources” in this mda for more information we ended the year with 7835 million of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our 

revolving credit facility in addition we returned 1610 million to our stockholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases

​ 

outlook 

​ 

we remain committed to prioritizing the health and wellbeing of our employees and contractors to supporting our customers and to maintaining our financial strength as the pandemic continues to impact the global economy in fiscal 2022 while the degree of the impact of the pandemic on our business remains uncertain we believe its effect on global frozen potato demand will continue to lessen as vaccination rates increase in the us and our key international markets and as governments continue to ease social restrictions in their respective jurisdictions we believe this will likely have a favorable impact on restaurant traffic especially for fullservice restaurants and other operations that have traditionally relied on onpremise dining as well as for other noncommercial operations such as hotels schools and universities and sporting venues in the us by the end of fiscal 2021 we saw shipments to large chain restaurants as well as in our foodservice segment in aggregate approach prepandemic levels as more governments eased social restrictions accordingly we continue to believe that overall frozen potato demand may approach prepandemic levels on a runrate basis by the end of the calendar year 

​ 

however we expect the ongoing effects of the pandemic and the rapid resurgence of the broader economy will pressure and disrupt our global supply chain operations in the nearterm which will result in volatile operating conditions and incremental manufacturing and distribution costs in addition in fiscal 2022 we expect the rate of inflation for many of our manufacturing commodity and distribution costs including but not limited to edible oils rail trucking ocean freight and packaging will increase compared to what we experienced in fiscal 2021 we expect to increase the selling price of our products to offset in whole or in part these higher costs

​ 

we expect overall sga to be higher as a result of increased compensation and benefits expense largely resulting from inflation as well as continued investments to improve our manufacturing supply chain commercial and information technology operations over the long term this includes resuming our efforts to implement the next phase of a new erp system which we deferred due to the disruptive impact of the pandemic on our operations as well as the significant number of employees working remotely

​ 

while the nearterm impact of the pandemic on sales volume and costs is volatile we believe we have sufficient liquidity to manage through the uncertainty and remain focused on our business and plans to drive longterm value creation

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

we have four reportable segments global foodservice retail and other we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment and on a consolidated basis product contribution margin when presented on a consolidated basis is a nongaap financial measure net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance product contribution margin represents net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses product contribution margin includes advertising and promotion expenses because those expenses are directly associated with the performance of the company’s segments for additional information on our reportable segments and product contribution margin see “nongaap financial measures” below and note 14 segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

net sales and product contribution margin 

​ 

 ​ 

net sales 

​ 

lamb weston’s net sales for fiscal 2021 declined 1215 million or 3 to 36709 million compared with 37924 million in fiscal 2020 volume declined 6 while pricemix increased 3 net sales and volume declined 2 and 6 respectively excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week in the prior year the decline in sales volume reflected soft demand for much of the first three fiscal quarters following governmentimposed pandemicrelated social restrictions including on restaurants and other foodservice operations sales volumes increased in the fiscal fourth quarter due to a recovery in demand as well as a comparison to reduced shipments in the prior year quarter when customers were destocking inventories as they adjusted to the abrupt change in the business environment the increase in pricemix was driven primarily by favorable pricing in our foodservice segment and favorable mix in our retail segment while pricemix in our global segment was flat

​ 

global net sales declined 621 million or 3 to 19115 million compared with 19736 million in fiscal 2020 volume declined 3 while pricemix was flat net sales and volume each declined 2 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week in the prior year sales volumes in the first half of the year declined as compared to the prior year but largely stabilized beginning in the fiscal third quarter behind strength in shipments to large quick service chain restaurant customers in the us sales volumes for the segment increased in the fiscal fourth quarter due to a recovery in demand in the us and in our key international markets as well as a comparison to reduced shipments in the prior year quarter when customers were destocking inventories pricemix was flat as positive pricing actions were offset by unfavorable customer mix 

​ 

foodservice net sales declined 518 million or 5 to 10173 million compared with 10691 million in fiscal 2020 volume declined 12 while pricemix increased 7 net sales and volume declined 4 and 11 respectively excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week in the prior year sales volumes during the first three quarters of the year declined as compared to the prior year as demand at fullservice restaurants and noncommercial customers were significantly affected by governmentimposed social restrictions sales volumes for the segment increased in the fiscal fourth quarter due to a recovery in most of the segment’s customer channels as well as a comparison to reduced shipments in the prior year quarter when customers were destocking inventories the increase in pricemix primarily reflected the carryover benefit of pricing actions implemented during fiscal 2020 partially offset by unfavorable mix as sales of lamb weston branded and premium products softened during the height of the pandemic 

​ 

retail net sales increased 79 million or 1 to 6034 million compared with 5955 million in fiscal 2020 pricemix increased 5 while volume declined 4 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week in the prior year net sales increased 4 and volume declined 2 the increase in pricemix was largely driven by favorable mix from higher sales of premium and mainstream branded offerings the decline in sales volumes reflected lower shipments of private label products resulting from incremental losses of certain lowmargin business partially offset by strong growth in branded products which have historically comprised approximately 40 percent of the segment’s volume in addition the sales volume decline reflects a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 which included a surge in demand for inhome consumption of frozen potato products following governmentimposed social restrictions 

​ 

net sales in our other segment declined 155 million or 10 to 1387 million compared with 1542 million in fiscal 2020 the decline primarily reflects lower volume in our vegetable business partially offset by favorable pricemix

​ 

gross profit and product contribution margin 

​ 

gross profit declined 632 million or 7 to 8320 million in fiscal 2021 the decline was driven by lower sales and higher manufacturing and distribution costs on a per pound basis which largely included incremental costs and inefficiencies related to the pandemic’s disruptive effect on our production transportation and warehousing operations and input and transportation cost inflation the increase in costs was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings in addition gross profit included a 404 million change in unrealized marktomarket adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts which reflects a 379 million gain in the current year compared with a 25 million loss related to these items in the prior year 

​ 

lamb weston’s overall product contribution margin in fiscal 2021 declined 580 million or 7 to 8142 million compared with 8722 million in fiscal 2020 the decline was driven by lower sales and higher manufacturing and distribution costs as described above

​ 

global segment product contribution margin declined 683 million or 18 to 3062 million in fiscal 2021 higher manufacturing and distribution costs as well as lower sales volumes largely drove the decline global segment cost of sales was 16014 million up 1 compared to fiscal 2020 as higher manufacturing and distribution costs were largely offset by the impact of lower sales volumes advertising and promotion spending declined 24 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020

​ 

foodservice product contribution margin declined 160 million or 4 to 3400 million in fiscal 2021 lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing and distribution costs more than offset the benefit of favorable pricemix cost of sales was 6724 million down 5 compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower sales volumes partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs advertising and promotion spending declined 23 million in fiscal 2021 as compared with fiscal 2020

​ 

retail product contribution margin increased 26 million or 2 to 1202 million in fiscal 2021 favorable product mix and a 04 million decrease in advertising and promotion spending more than offset the impact of higher manufacturing and distribution costs and lower sales volumes of private label products cost of sales was 4743 million up 1 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs partially offset by lower sales volumes 

​ 

other product contribution margin increased 237 million to 478 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to 241 million in fiscal 2020 these amounts include a 278 million gain related to unrealized marktomarket adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts and a 02 million loss related to the contracts in fiscal 2020 excluding these marktomarket adjustments other segment product contribution margin declined 43 million largely due to higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volumes in our vegetable business

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

​ 

sga expenses were 3572 million up 189 million or 6 in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 the increase was largely driven by investments to improve our manufacturing supply chain commercial and information 

technology operations over the long term and included approximately 9 million of nonrecurring expenses primarily consulting and employee training expenses associated with implementing the first phase of a new erp system compared to approximately 8 million in the prior year the increase in sga was also driven by higher compensation and benefits expense partially offset by a 52 million decline in ap expense as well as by cost management efforts 

​ 

interest expense net 

​ 

interest expense net was 1183 million in fiscal 2021 an increase of 103 million compared with fiscal 2020 the increase in interest expense net was the result of a higher level of average total debt versus the prior year resulting from our actions in late fiscal 2020 and early fiscal 2021 to enhance our liquidity position during the pandemic for more information see note 8 debt and financing obligations of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

our effective tax rate was 222 for fiscal 2021 compared to 235 in fiscal 2020 the difference between our effective tax rates in fiscal 2021 and 2020 is primarily due to permanent differences and discrete items our effective tax rate varies from the us statutory tax rate of 21 principally due to the impact of us state taxes foreign taxes permanent differences and discrete items

​ 

for further information on income taxes see note 3 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

equity method investment earnings 

​ 

we conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them lamb weston’s share of earnings from its equity method investments was 518 million and 293 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively earnings in fiscal 2020 included a 26 million loss related to the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan by lamb weston rdo equity method investment earnings also included an 113 million unrealized gain related to marktomarket adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2021 and a 63 million loss related to these items in fiscal 2020 in addition in december 2020 lambwestonmeijer increased its ownership interest in its russian joint venture from 355 to 749 and now consolidates that joint venture in its results 

​ 

excluding the lamb weston rdo pensionrelated comparability item and the marktomarket adjustments earnings from equity method investments increased 23 million compared to the prior year period largely driven by lambwestonmeijer’s increased ownership interest in its russian joint venture and higher manufacturing costs per pound in the prior year partially offset by lower frozen potato demand in europe following governmentimposed restrictions on restaurant and other foodservice operations

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

we ended fiscal 2021 in a strong financial position with resources available for reinvesting in our business including our strategic growth initiatives pursuing acquisition opportunities that we may identify and managing our capital structure on a shortterm and longterm basis at may 30 2021 we had 7835 million of cash and cash equivalents and 7446 million of availability under our revolving credit facility 

​ 

while we expect the nearterm impact of the pandemic on sales volume and costs to remain volatile we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet projected capital expenditures service existing debt and meet working capital requirements for the next 12 months with current cash balances and cash from operations supplemented as necessary by available borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility 

​ 

cash flows 

​ 

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating investing and financing activities dollars in millions

​ 

 ​ 

operating activities 

​ 

during fiscal 2021 cash provided by operating activities decreased 208 million to 5532 million compared with 5740 million in the same period a year ago the decrease related to a 992 million decrease in net income adjusted for noncash income and expenses partially offset by 784 million of cash provided by favorable changes in working capital lower income from operations related to governmentimposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations to slow the spread of covid19 see “results of operations” in this mda for more information favorable changes in working capital primarily related to an increase in accounts payable due to timing and an increase in our accrued liabilities primarily related to higher compensation and benefits accruals this favorability was partially offset by higher finished goods inventory due to building more pounds of inventory to meet expected demand as sales began to reach prepandemic levels compared with lower inventories at the end of fiscal 2020 when demand decreased due to the covid19 pandemic as well as incremental costs related to rising input and other costs higher receivables due to more sales at the end of fiscal 2021 compared with the end of fiscal 2020 and an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily due to an increase in favorable open commodity contract hedge positions at the end of fiscal 2021 driven by a rise in edible oil prices

​ 

investing activities 

​ 

investing activities used 1625 million of cash in fiscal 2021 compared with 3460 million in fiscal 2020 excluding cash used for the acquisition of a frozen potato processor in australia and for an investment in an equity method joint venture in the prior year cash used for investing activities decreased 442 million compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease represents our concerted effort to control spending at the onset of the pandemic to preserve liquidity 

​ 

we expect capital investments in fiscal 2022 to be approximately 650 million to 700 million depending on timing of projects which include among other items completion of our chopped and formed capacity expansion in american falls idaho initial construction of a new french fry processing line and plant modernization investments in american falls idaho and initial construction of a greenfield french fry processing facility in ulanqab inner mongolia china these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions including the impact of covid19 and our regulatory compliance requirements at may 30 2021 we had commitments for capital expenditures of 750 million

​ 

financing activities 

​ 

we took various actions to further strengthen our liquidity position in response to the covid19 pandemic which included raising over 1 billion of liquidity in the last quarter of fiscal 2020 including borrowing 4950 million under our revolving credit facility entering into a new 3250 million term loan facility and issuing 5000 million of senior notes due in 2028 these actions also included deferring the payment of our payroll taxes as allowed under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares” act the cares act allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer portion of social security taxes accrued between march 27 2020 and december 31 2020 

under the cares act 50 of the deferred payroll taxes will be paid by december 31 2021 and the remainder will be paid by december 31 2022 in addition in june 2019 we entered into a new 3000 million term loan facility due in june 2024 and used the proceeds to repay 3000 million of the term loan facility that was due in 2021

​

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of may 30 2021 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

​

​ 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 30 2021 are as follows dollars in millions the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table are estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to our trade promotions income taxes and acquisitions among others we base our estimates on historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

​ 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results these estimates require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors

​ 

while we have taken into account certain impacts arising from covid19 in connection with the accounting estimates reflected in this form 10k the full impact of covid19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated however we have made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the 

reporting date to the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results our consolidated financial statements may be affected

​ 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

​ 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions sales promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives the estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and redemption rates influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories

​ 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products the costs of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability the estimate of trade promotions is inherently difficult due to information limitations as the products move beyond distributors and through the supply chain to operators estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities current and past tradepromotion spending patterns the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs

​ 

the determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer demand for our products promotion participation particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event because of the complexity of some of these trade promotions the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from our estimates as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates at may 30 2021 and may 31 2020 we had 399 million and 425 million respectively of sales incentives and trade promotions payable recorded in “accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

we compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled

​ 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes management judgments are required for the following items

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

acquisitions 

​ 

from time to time we may enter into business combinations we allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values fair value is determined using the income approach cost approach andor market approach of inventory property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions among others this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

significant estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of brands and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could increase or decrease

nongaap financial measures 

​ 

to supplement the financial information included in this report we have presented product contribution margin on a consolidated basis adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps each of which is considered a nongaap financial measure 

​ 

product contribution margin is one of the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance product contribution margin represents net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses product contribution margin includes advertising and promotion expenses because those expenses are directly associated with the performance of our segments our management also uses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps to evaluate our performance excluding the impact of certain noncash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods we include 

these nongaap financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when used in conjunction with gaap financial measures is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing our operating performance and underlying prospects these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as alternatives for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures the same way these measures are not a substitute for their comparable gaap financial measures such as gross profit net income loss or diluted earnings per share and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in the normal course of business we may periodically enter into derivatives to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes the effects of the covid19 pandemic have resulted in volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate at the time of this filing we are unable to predict or determine the impacts that the covid19 pandemic may continue to have on our exposure to market risk from commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates among other factors for additional discussion refer to “forwardlooking statements” “liquidity and capital resources” within “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” as well as “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k

​ 

based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of may 30 2021 and may 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to “cost of sales” of approximately 77 million 59 million net of income tax benefit and 96 million 74 million net of income tax benefit respectively it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item

​ 

including our joint ventures we transact business in multiple currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate risk through investments and businesses owned and operated in foreign countries at may 30 2021 and may 31 2020 we had no financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risk

​ 

at may 30 2021 we had 21660 million of fixedrate and 5866 million of variablerate debt outstanding at may 31 2020 we had 21660 million of fixedrate and 13890 million of variablerate debt outstanding we have interest rate risk associated with our variablerate debt a one percent increase in interest rates related to variablerate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately 59 million annually 46 million net of income tax benefit and 141 million annually 108 million net of income tax benefit at may 30 2021 and may 31 2020 respectively

​ 

trademarks licenses and patents 

​ 

our trademarks are material to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other geographic markets where the related food items are sold depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use and their registrations are maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms our significant trademarks include lamb weston lamb’s supreme lamb weston seeing possibilities in potatoes and design lamb’s seasoned lw private reserve stealth fries and sweet things we also sell certain products such as grown in idaho and alexia  which we license from third parties 

​ 

we own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions including packaging manufacturing processes equipment formulations and designs our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while we consider our patent portfolio to be material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

​ 

raw materials and packaging 

​ 

our primary raw materials are potatoes edible oils and packaging we source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic longterm grower relationships and shorterterm annual contracts in the united states most of the potato crop used in our products is grown in washington idaho and oregon for lambwestonmeijer european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands austria belgium germany france and the united kingdom we also have growing regions in china australia and argentina we believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs yeartoyear we source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers and we source energy and packaging materials through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types

​ 

the prices paid for these raw materials as well as other raw materials used in making our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply

​ 

from time to time we have faced increased costs for our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through longterm relationships contract strategies and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists as well as through our pricing and productivity initiatives 

​ 

manufacturing 

​ 

we operate 18 manufacturing facilities for our products see item 2 properties for more information about our manufacturing facilities our joint ventures operate a total of nine manufacturing facilities

​ 

in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we source a portion of our products under “copacking” agreements a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies we regularly evaluate our copacking arrangements to ensure the most costeffective manufacturing of our products and to utilize companyowned manufacturing facilities most effectively

​ 

international operations 

​ 

at may 31 2020 we had operations in eighteen countries with manufacturing and processing facilities in four countries foreign net sales including sales by domestic segments to customers located outside of the united states were approximately 7529 million 7427 million and 6658 million in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively our long

lived assets located outside of the united states are not significant see note 14 segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k for additional information on our us and nonus operations also see “item 2 properties” for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states see “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

​ 

backlog 

​ 

we manufacture primarily to fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders due to the seasonal nature of our manufacturing activities and associated inventory such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant

​ 

competition 

​ 

the valueadded frozen potato products industry in north america europe and other international markets is highly competitive competitors include large north american and european frozen potato product companies that compete globally as well as local and regional companies significant competitors include agristo nv aviko bv cavendish farms corporation clarebout potatoes nv farm frites international bv jr simplot company the kraft heinz company mccain foods limited and mydibel sa some of our competitors are larger and have substantially more financial sales and marketing and other resources we compete with producers of similar products on the basis of among other things customer service value product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty price and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences the markets in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future see also “item 1a risk factors – increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits” of this form 10k

​ 

seasonality 

​ 

our product contribution margin percentage inventory levels net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality in general our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter reflecting the benefit of freshlyharvested potatoes we typically harvest potatoes in the pacific northwest of the united states in july through october which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter freshlyharvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs we typically hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory on a firstinfirstout basis so the relatively favorable costs primarily incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter requiring more working capital at that time in general net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns

​ 

due to severe impacts of the government mandated shutdowns in response to the covid19 pandemic seasonal variations in the demand for our products in fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 differed from prior years the fiscal fourth quarter operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year

​ 

employees 

​ 

as of june 30 2020 we had approximately 7700 employees approximately 800 of these employees work outside of the united states approximately 23 of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate most of the union workers at our facilities are represented under contracts that expire at various times throughout the next several years collective bargaining agreements that represent approximately 19 of our hourly employees who are parties to collective bargaining agreements expire in fiscal 2021 as these agreements expire we believe they will be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us 

​

 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future

​ 

government actions to control the spread of covid19 have adversely impacted and are likely to continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

the efforts by national state and local governments worldwide to control the spread of covid19 have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines travel bans shutdowns and shelterinplace or stayathome orders which have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods these restrictions and measures and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees customers suppliers vendors and joint venture and other business partners have affected and are continuing to affect our business and operations by among other things causing the closure of many sit down restaurants reducing demand at quick service restaurants causing us to modify a number of our normal business practices including the ongoing evaluation of our manufacturing employees’ covid19 symptom status evaluating the need for facility closures or temporary shutdowns to protect employee health disrupting production timing disrupting our supply chain disrupting the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us 

to our customers requiring modifications to our business processes requiring the modification of business continuity plans requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing practices disrupting business travel disrupting our ability to staff our onsite manufacturing and research and development facilities delaying capital expansion projects and other capital expenditures and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce these impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause changes in the mix of products sold decreases in revenue and increases in costs resulting in decreased profitability and cash flows from operations which have caused and are expected to cause an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations that may be material

​ 

in addition we cannot predict the impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our customers suppliers vendors and joint venture and other business partners and each of their financial conditions any material adverse effect on these parties could adversely impact us in this regard the potential duration and impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy and on our business financial condition and results of operations are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty but the pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets increases in levels of unemployment and economic uncertainty which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so these developments may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending demand for our products the ability of our customers to pay our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers and may also negatively impact our access to external sources of financing to fund our operations or make capital expenditures

​ 

the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this form 10k any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations this situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we currently are not aware of

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs disruption of supply or interruptions or other constraints in the availability of key commodities and other necessary services 

​ 

a significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as raw potatoes edible oil and energy these commodities are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors including changes in global supply and demand weather conditions including any potential effects of climate change fire natural disasters such as a hurricane tornado earthquake wildfire or flooding disease or pests agricultural uncertainty health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the current covid19 pandemic governmental incentives and controls including importexport restrictions such as new or increased tariffs sanctions quotas or trade barriers limited or sole sources of supply political uncertainties acts of terrorism governmental instability or currency exchange rates in addition we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products commodity price increases or a sustained interruption or other constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities including necessary services such as transportation and warehousing may increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and decreased profitability there is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the united states although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases as a result the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend

​ 

in addition our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative functions however gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time in addition we may have significant supply chain disruptions due to a number of factors outside of our control including public health crises such as the current covid19 pandemic these factors may lead to our inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner which could lead to increased warehouse and other storage costs our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs or the occurrence of a significant supply chain disruption or the inability to access or 

deliver products could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position or otherwise harm our business

​ 

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

​ 

our business valueadded frozen potato products is highly competitive our principal competitors have substantial financial sales and marketing and other resources a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing increasing promotional activity or losing market share competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume

​ 

increased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits 

​ 

in recent years market demand for valueadded frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products as additional industry capacity comes online or market demand otherwise decreases including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations including foreign currency risks and trade barriers 

​ 

we conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the united states including through our joint ventures during each of fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 net sales outside the united states primarily in australia canada china japan korea mexico and taiwan accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales these amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures which are also subject to risks associated with international operations

​ 

many factors relating to our international sales and operations many of which factors are outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations including



 ​ 

any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

disruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

to serve our customers globally we rely in part on our international joint venture partnerships but also on exports from the united states during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 export sales from the united states accounted for approximately 16 16 and 17 respectively of our total net sales circumstances beyond our control such as a labor dispute at a port or workforce disruption due to the current covid19 pandemic could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities we have access to production outside of the united states through our facilities in australia canada and china and joint ventures in argentina and europe but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms if this occurs we may be unable to adequately supply all of our customer opportunities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

our substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

​ 

we have incurred substantial indebtedness as of may 31 2020 we had 30414 million of longterm debt including current portion recorded on our consolidated balance sheet our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

​ 

 ​ 

the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business 

​ 

the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability to 

 ​ 

these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities 

​ 

various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations also the limitations imposed by these financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing

​ 

in addition the restrictive covenants in our credit agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these ratios and tests our ability to continue to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond our control a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments including as a result of cross default provisions and in the case of our revolving credit facility permit the lenders thereunder to cease making loans to us upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit such action by the lenders could cause crossdefaults under our senior notes indentures 

​ 

additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs further under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with conagra at the spinoff we may not retire repurchase or significantly modify our senior notes due 2024 and 2026 during the fiveyear period following the spinoff

​ 

our business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region 

​ 

ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our valueadded products eg french fries are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally in the united states most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in washington idaho and oregon european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in austria belgium germany france the netherlands and the united kingdom recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions but the capitalintensive nature of our industry’s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions unfavorable crop conditions in any one region such as the drought in europe during our fiscal year 2019 could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability

​ 

our business is affected by potato crop performance 

​ 

our primary input is potatoes and every year we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into valueadded products environmental and climate conditions such as soil quality moisture and temperature affect the quality of the potato crop on a yeartoyear basis as a result we source potatoes from specific regions of the united states and specific countries abroad including australia austria belgium canada china france germany the netherlands and the united kingdom where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist however severe weather conditions during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance such as the drought in europe during our fiscal year 2019 potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure decreased yields and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes we have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop however if a weather or pestrelated event occurs in a particular crop year and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our customer opportunities and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease alternatively overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and oversupply an increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods and associated increased storage costs or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss

​ 

changes in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us 

​ 

we expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers in some instances we have entered into longterm agreements with growers however a portion of our potato needs are typically sourced on an annual basis to the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our longterm growers contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities to obtain sufficient potato supply we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected or forgo sales to some market segments which would reduce our profitability if we forgo sales to such market segments we may lose customers and may not be able to replace them later

​ 

changes in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us 

​ 

we maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments customers include global national and regional quick serve and fast casual restaurants as well as small independently operated restaurants multinational broadline foodservice distributors as well as regional foodservice distributors and major food retailers some of these customers independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales in addition we depend on foodservice distributors to help us create endcustomer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue the foodservice distributors also sell products that compete with our products and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products while we contract annually or biannually with many of our foodservice customers the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially impact the business 

​ 

our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation accounted for approximately 10 of our consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2020 and 2019 and 11 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018 there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the financial condition of our significant customers including restaurants distributors and retailers are affected by events that are largely beyond our control deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

the sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

​ 

some of our customers are large and sophisticated with buying power and negotiating strength these customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing increased promotional 

programs or specialty tailored products in addition some of these customers eg larger distributors and supermarkets have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed and large retail customers may choose to stock their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality however if we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers our profitability could decline

​ 

we must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences and trends 

​ 

consumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences we need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences for example as consumers focus on freshly prepared foods some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens as a result we must evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment in addition our products contain carbohydrates sodium genetically modified ingredients added sugars saturated fats and preservatives the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny we must continue to reformulate our products introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste texture and appearance that consumers demand in valueadded potato products all of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

a portion of our business is and several of our growth strategies are conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit 

​ 

we have built our company in part through the creation of joint ventures some of which we do not control in these relationships we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners rather than our exclusive benefit through our extensive experience in operating a portion of our business through joint ventures we understand that joint ventures often require additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decisionmaking if our joint venture partners take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture or disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those actions or decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted

​ 

if we are unable to complete potential acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives integrate acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include i diversion of management attention from existing businesses ii difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems iii difficulties implementing effective control environment processes iv adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers v inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings vi potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and vii indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers if we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects such as new production lines our financial results could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

new regulations imposed by the fda or efsa around acrylamide formation in potato products could adversely affect us 

​ 

the regulation of food products both within the united states and internationally continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny the presence andor formation of acrylamide in potato products cooked at high temperatures has become a global regulatory issue as both the fda and the european food safety authority ‘‘efsa’’ have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring 

compound acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give ‘‘browned foods’’ their desirable flavor acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet including but not limited to breads toast cookies coffee crackers potatoes and olives the regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control temperature and material testing low sugar and low asparagine however limits for acrylamide content have been established for some food types in the state of california and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits in addition the efsa has recently promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products if the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and additional legal limits are established our manufacturing costs could increase in addition if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation sales of our products could decrease

​ 

if we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

​ 

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the us department of agriculture the fda the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products

​ 

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies which pertain to the protection of the environment including but not limited to discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

litigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

we are or may become party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability product recalls product liability product claims employment matters environmental matters or other aspects of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business 

​ 

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances which would cause us to incur associated costs those costs could be meaningful we may also be subject to litigation requests for indemnification from our customers or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury illness or death a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time 

depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image

​ 

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

damage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

​ 

our customers rely on us and our comanufacturers to manufacture safe high quality food products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may damage the reputation of our customers and ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions

​ 

our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for our operations and activities our research and development efforts our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management our failure to comply with local laws and regulations our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

​ 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

​ 

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

​ 

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

​ 

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent thirdparty verification our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters infectious disease outbreaks and other public health crises fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our 

information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

​ 

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers or suppliers 

​ 

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations potentially significant fines and penalties damage to our reputation and credibility loss of strategic opportunities and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may face business interruptions litigation and financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or customers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems

​ 

we intend to replace our information technology infrastructure and plan to implement a new enterprise resource planning system problems with the transition design or implementation of this upgrade could interfere with our business and operations and adversely affect our financial condition 

​ 

we are currently in the process of replacing our information technology infrastructure with a new enterprise resource planning ‘‘erp’’ system which will be implemented in phases beginning in fiscal 2021 we may experience difficulties as we transition to new upgraded systems and processes these difficulties may include loss of data difficulty in processing customer orders shipping products or providing services and support to our customers difficulty in billing and tracking our orders difficulty in completing financial reporting and filing reports with the sec in a timely manner or challenges in otherwise running our business we may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the transition design and implementation of a new erp system particularly any disruptions delays or deficiencies that impact our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we do not encounter adverse effects the transition design and implementation of a new erp system may be much more costly than we anticipated

​ 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

​ 

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline 

if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially and adversely affected 

​ 

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience as well as finance marketing and other senior management professionals the market for these employees is competitive and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business if we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new highquality employees our business could be materially and adversely affected

​ 

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

​ 

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as potatoes and edible oils in addition water is an important part of potato processing we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations 

​ 

the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases as well as more stringent regulation of water rights in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions improve our energy efficiency and reduce and reuse water we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations

​ 

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

​ 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

​ 

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows

​ 

 ​ 

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

​ 

as of may 31 2020 we had goodwill of 3038 million and other intangibles of 383 million the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of brands trademarks licensing agreements customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by 

management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth

​ 

executive summary 

​ 

on march 11 2020 during our fiscal fourth quarter the world health organization declared that the spread of covid19 qualified as a global pandemic local state and national governments emphasized the importance of food supply and asked that food manufacturers and retailers remain open to meet the needs of their communities throughout 

this pandemic our primary focus and attention has remained directed towards the health and wellbeing of our employees and we have taken numerous steps to keep our employees safe including implementing enhanced sanitation protocols and preventative screenings at all our manufacturing facilities providing masks and requiring social distancing for employees across all our facilities providing benefits that help support our employees and their families and implementing remote work arrangements for functional support areas to comply with shelterinplace orders and federal and local government recommendations if an employee at one of our manufacturing facilities tests positive for covid19 we have developed plans to temporarily close the facility at which the employee works in order to sanitize and disinfect the facility before allowing employees to return to the facility and restart operations

​ 

lamb weston delivered solid sales and earnings growth through the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 however efforts by governments worldwide to control the spread of covid19 have resulted in significant social and economic restrictions which included quarantines travel bans shutdowns closures of many sit down restaurants and shelterinplace or stayathome orders these restrictions have had and continue to have a negative effect on portions of our business and the us and global economy as a result our sales in the fiscal fourth quarter declined offsetting most of the growth that we generated earlier in our fiscal year 

​ 

following the governmentimposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations and stayathome orders we saw significant changes in french fry consumption and purchasing patterns as a result we experienced favorable revenue and earnings impacts within our retail segment which has historically contributed approximately 13 of total lamb weston sales but these favorable impacts were more than offset by the unfavorable impacts within our foodawayfromhome businesses in our global and foodservice segments specifically through the end of fiscal 2020 we observed the following

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

for the full fiscal year our earnings declined largely due to lower sales and higher costs related to the pandemic

​ 

our fiscal 2020 financial results include the benefit of an additional week “53 rd week” of sales earnings and cash flow versus fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2019

​ 

 ​ 

comparing performance with fiscal 2019 the increase in net sales was driven by improved pricemix largely due to pricing actions in our foodservice and retail segments volume was flat as declines in our foodservice segment which was disproportionately affected by the governmentimposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations offset growth in our retail and global segments volume in both our global and foodservice segments was also negatively affected by customers destocking inventories as they adjusted to the abrupt change in the operating environment during our fiscal fourth quarter income from operations declined largely due to costs related to the pandemic’s impact on our operations and higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation inefficiencies higher depreciation expense and unfavorable mix the effect of higher sga expenses was modest relative to the decline in gross profit

​ 

in fiscal 2020 we and our unconsolidated joint ventures incurred approximately 74 million of costs net of employee retention credits provided by the cares act and other labor incentives related to the pandemic’s impact on operations as follows

​ 

  ​ 

we expect that we will continue to incur some of these costs until the covid19 pandemic no longer has an impact on our operations

​ 

during the fourth quarter in response to the significant decrease in demand as the covid19 virus spread throughout the world we reduced production at our factories to align with demand instituted a companywide hiring freeze and delayed nonessential expenditures we took actions to enhance our liquidity including working capital management significantly reducing our capital program raising over 1 billion of liquidity including borrowing 4950 million from our previously undrawn revolving credit facility entering into a new 3250 million term loan facility issuing 5000 million of senior notes and suspending future share repurchases in addition at may 31 2020 we qualified for and recorded a 95 million receivable for employee retention credits under the cares act and other labor incentives the cares act also allows us to defer payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020 with 50 of the deferred amount due december 31 2021 and the remaining 50 due december 31 2022 considering the current environment with a significant number of employees working remotely we deferred work on the second phase of our new enterprise resource planning “erp” system as a result of these actions our cash and cash equivalents balance at may 31 2020 was 13640 million see liquidity and capital resources in this mda below for more information

​ 

outlook 

​ 

as discussed above following the governmentimposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations which largely began during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the demand for frozen potato products decreased in north america europe and most of our key international markets the outlook for the spread of covid19 as well as governments’ efforts to contain the virus remains unpredictable as does its potential impact on the global economy restaurant traffic customer and consumer demand our supply chain and availability of key commodities and other necessary services because of uncertainty around government actions and consumer behaviors related to the virus we expect the impact of the covid19 pandemic on consumer demand and our sales volume may be pronounced in fiscal 2021 especially for fullservice restaurants and other operations that have traditionally relied on onpremise dining traffic and other noncommercial foodservice operations such as hotels schools and universities and sporting venues while governments began easing restrictions on restaurants and we realized improvements in our shipments in each of our primary sales channels through the first seven weeks of the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we believe these improvements may become less pronounced cease or reverse as the spread of covid19 continues and government authorities reinstate or otherwise postpone onpremises dining restrictions

​ 

we have taken actions and will continue to evaluate various options to lower our cost structure and maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing and commercial operations as we disclosed in our form 8k filed with the sec on may 7 2020 we reduced contracting of raw potatoes by approximately 2025 for the 2020 crop year compared with our 2019 crop year purchases we believe that there will likely be adequate noncontracted processing potatoes available for purchase in the event that frozen potato demand exceeds our initial forecast we will continue to evaluate various options to adjust our operations including temporarily closing facilities andor modifying production schedules to rebalance utilization rates across our manufacturing network

​ 

we expect that we will continue to incur costs as a result of the covid19 pandemic’s impact on our manufacturing supply chain commercial and functional support operations for example these may include costs to adopt and maintain enhanced employee safety and sanitation protocols such as purchasing personal protection and health screening equipment and services costs to shut down sanitize and restart production facilities after a production employee has been infected by the virus production inefficiencies and labor retention costs arising from modifying production schedules reducing runtimes and lower overall factory utilization incremental warehousing and transportation costs and costs to retain sales and functional support employees

​ 

in fiscal 2021 we expect the rate of inflation for many of our commodity and manufacturing costs in the near term will be similar to what we experienced in fiscal 2020 while we have implemented a hiring and salary freeze for our us salaried positions in the near term we expect overall sga may be higher as a result of the completion of the first phase of our erp project as well as for continued investments in operations and other functional capabilities which are designed to drive operating efficiencies and support growth over the long term

​ 

results of operations 

​ 

we have four reportable segments global foodservice retail and other for each period presented we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance we define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses product contribution margin excludes general corporate expenses and interest expense because management believes these amounts are not directly associated with segment performance for the period for additional information on our reportable segments see note 14 segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

 ​ 

net sales 

​ 

lamb weston’s net sales for fiscal 2020 increased 359 million or 1 to 37924 million compared with 37565 million in fiscal 2019 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week net sales declined 1 pricemix increased 1 due to pricing actions and favorable mix largely due to pricing actions in our foodservice and retail segments volume was flat or down 3 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week as strong growth through the first three fiscal quarters was offset by the sharp and abrupt decline in demand for frozen potato products outside the home during the fiscal fourth quarter as a result of governmentimposed restrictions on restaurants and other foodservice operations to slow the spread of the covid19 virus as well as customers destocking inventories as they adjusted to abrupt change in the business environment

​ 

global net sales increased 121 million or 1 to 19736 million compared with 19615 million in fiscal 2019 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week net sales declined 1 volume increased 1 or down 1 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the us and key international markets during the first three quarters of the fiscal year volume growth was partially offset by the sharp decline in demand for frozen potato products outside the home during the fourth quarter primarily attributable to governmentimposed restrictions on restaurant and other foodservicerelated operations pricemix was flat as positive pricing actions were offset by unfavorable customer mix 

​ 

foodservice net sales decreased 870 million or 8 to 10691 million compared with 11561 million in fiscal 2019 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week net sales declined 8 pricemix increased 2 primarily reflecting pricing actions initiated in the fall of 2019 volume decreased 10 or 10 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week volume growth of distributor private label and lamb weston branded products was solid during the first three quarters of the fiscal year but fell as demand for frozen potato products outside the home especially at fullservice restaurants and noncommercial operations eg hotels schools and universities sporting venues dropped sharply during the fourth quarter following governmentimposed restrictions on restaurant and other foodservice operations as well as customers destocking inventories as they adjusted to the abrupt change in the business environment

​ 

retail net sales increased 972 million or 20 to 5955 million compared with 4983 million in fiscal 2019 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week net sales increased 16 volume increased 13 or 10 excluding the benefit of the 53 rd week due to increased inhome consumption of frozen potato products following governmentimposed stayathome orders during the fiscal fourth quarter demand was strong across our premium and mainstream branded offerings as well as for our private label products pricemix increased 7 largely driven by favorable mix from increased sales of branded products and pricing actions

​ 

net sales in our other segment increased 136 million or 10 to 1542 million compared with 1406 million in fiscal 2019 the increase primarily reflects higher volume in our vegetable business 

​ 

product contribution margin 

​ 

lamb weston’s product contribution margin for fiscal 2020 decreased 989 million or 10 to 8722 million compared with 9711 million in fiscal 2019 the decline primarily related to lower sales due to the pandemic and approximately 47 million of pandemicrelated costs net of cares act retention credits and other labor incentives resulting from lower factory utilization and production inefficiencies manufacturing and operational disruptions directly attributable to the pandemic expensing of excess crop year 2019 raw potato purchase contracts and other supply chain costs discussed above the remainder of the decline was driven by higher manufacturing costs due to input cost inflation inefficiencies higher depreciation expense primarily associated with our new french fry production line in hermiston oregon and unfavorable mix

​ 

global product contribution margin decreased 718 million or 16 to 3745 million in fiscal 2020 the decline primarily related to lower sales due to the pandemic and approximately 29 million of pandemicrelated costs net of cares act retention credits and other labor incentives the remainder of the decline was largely driven by an increase in cost of sales which rose 6 to 15928 million reflecting unfavorable mix inefficiencies and input cost inflation as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the addition of the new production line in hermiston oregon advertising and promotion spending was modestly lower in 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019

​ 

foodservice product contribution margin decreased 464 million or 12 to 3560 million in fiscal 2020 lower sales due to the pandemic and approximately 8 million of pandemicrelated costs net of cares act retention credits and other labor incentives cost of sales declined 5 to 7059 million due to lower sales volumes partially offset by inefficiencies and input cost inflation as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the addition of the new production line in hermiston oregon advertising and promotion spending was modestly lower in fiscal 2020 as compared with fiscal 2019

​ 

retail product contribution margin increased 188 million or 19 to 1176 million in fiscal 2020 due to higher sales volumes as consumers modified their purchasing habits in response to the imposition of stayathome orders favorable product mix and an 83 million decline in advertising and promotional expenses as we stopped all nonessential expenditures in response to the pandemic the increase was partially offset by approximately 10 million of pandemicrelated costs net of cares act retention credits and other labor incentives cost of sales was 4686 million or 23 higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 largely due to higher sales volume and input cost inflation

​ 

other product contribution margin increased 05 million to 241 million in fiscal 2020 as compared to 236 million in fiscal 2019 these amounts include a 02 million loss related to unrealized marktomarket adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2020 and a 33 million loss related to the 

contracts in fiscal 2019 excluding these adjustments other segment product contribution margin decreased 26 million largely due to unfavorable pricemix in our vegetable business

​ 

selling general and administrative expenses 

​ 

sga expenses were 3383 million up 32 million or 1 in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 the increase in sga was largely driven by approximately 11 million of net pandemicrelated sga and other expenses described above higher expenses related to our information technology services and infrastructure including approximately 8 million of nonrecurring expenses excluding expenses payable to us by lambwestonmeijer under the cost sharing agreement that primarily relates to consulting expenses associated with developing and implementing a new erp system and investments in our sales marketing and operating capabilities the increase was partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals a 95 million reduction in advertising and promotional expenses lower travel and meeting expenses and suspending contributions to our charitable foundation for more information related to the agreement with lambwestonmeijer to share the costs of a single global erp platform and related software and services see note 6 investments in joint ventures of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k

​ 

interest expense net 

​ 

interest expense net was 1080 million in fiscal 2020 an increase of 09 million compared with fiscal 2019 the increase in interest expense net was the result of higher average total debt versus the prior year for more information see note 9 debt and financing obligations of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

our effective tax rate was 235 for fiscal 2020 compared to 215 in fiscal 2019 fiscal 2019 includes a 24 million decrease in income tax expense related to the trueup of the transition tax on previously untaxed foreign earnings under the tax act excluding this comparability item our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 219 the difference between our effective tax rates in fiscal 2020 and 2019 is primarily due to permanent differences and discrete items the effective tax rate varies from the us statutory tax rate of 21 principally due to the impact of us state taxes foreign taxes permanent differences and discrete items

​ 

impact of new lease standard 

​ 

the adoption of the new lease standard resulted in the recognition of approximately 155 million of operating lease assets and shortterm and longterm operating lease obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet related to operating leases the adoption also resulted in a 266 million 205 million net of tax cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the elimination of 387 million of land and 653 million of finance lease obligations related to a sale leaseback see note 4 leases of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

​ 

acquisitions 

​ 

on july 2 2019 and december 21 2018 we acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of two different frozen potato processors in australia for 1167 million and 886 million respectively net of cash acquired these acquisitions added approximately 70 million and 50 million pounds of production capacity respectively to our manufacturing network and expanded our geographic reach net sales income from operations and total assets from either of these acquisitions are not material to our consolidated net sales income from operations and total assets the operating results for the acquisitions are included in our global segment 

​ 

we allocated the purchase price of the july 2019 and december 2018 acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of the fair value at the dates of the acquisitions of which 1061 million and 751 million after final working capital adjustments was allocated to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 

​ 

liquidity and capital resources 

​ 

the recent covid19 pandemic has disrupted our business and operating results as a result of the uncertainties caused by the covid19 pandemic we have taken and are continuing to take actions to enhance liquidity including working capital management and limiting discretionary expenses across the company implementing a hiring and salary freeze for our us salaried positions significantly reducing our capital program raising over 1 billion of liquidity including borrowing 4950 million from our previously undrawn revolving credit facility entering into a new 3250 million term loan facility and issuing 5000 million of senior notes and suspending future share repurchases in addition at may 31 2020 we qualified for and recorded a 95 million receivable for employee retention credits under the cares act and other labor incentives the cares act also allows us to defer payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of 2020 with 50 of the deferred amount due december 31 2021 and the remaining 50 due december 31 2022 this is expected to provide us with approximately 14 million of additional liquidity during fiscal 2021 considering the current environment with a significant number of employees working remotely we have also deferred the second phase of our new erp system as a result of our actions our cash and cash equivalents balance at may 31 2020 was 13640 million

we believe our cash on hand cash flows from operations and our current credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital requirements interest payments capital expenditures dividends on our common stock and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future we continue to evaluate and take action as necessary to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can continue to operate during these uncertain times if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or are otherwise unable to comply with the terms of our credit facilities we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives which may require waivers under our credit agreement governing our senior secured debt and indentures governing our senior notes in order to generate additional cash there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional financing or any such waivers on terms acceptable to us or at all for additional information on our debt see note 9 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k”

 ​ 

operating activities 

​ 

fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

​ 

the major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital cash generated from operating activities decreased 1069 million to 5740 million in fiscal 2020 compared with 6809 million in fiscal 2019 earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expenses decreased 842 million primarily due to lower sales during the pandemic and approximately 74 million of pandemicrelated costs net of cares act retention credits and other labor incentives see results of operations in this mda for more information changes in operating assets and liabilities used 173 million more cash in fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 the increase in cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by the timing of payments for accounts payable and lower expected payments for incentive compensation and trade programs these cash outflows were partially offset by lower receivables due to fewer sales at the end of fiscal 2020 compared with the end of fiscal 2019 the timing of payments for income taxes and lower finished goods inventory due to declines in demand during the fiscal fourth quarter as a result of the pandemicrelated governmentimposed restrictions

​ 

in order to preserve liquidity throughout the covid19 pandemic we deferred substantially all of our previously planned fiscal 2021 strategic capital expenditures we expect capital investments in fiscal 2021 to be approximately 140 million excluding acquisitions these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions including the impact of covid19 and our regulatory compliance requirements at may 31 2020 we had commitments for capital expenditures of 365 million

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of may 31 2020 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

​

​ 

obligations and commitments 

​ 

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements potato supply agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum 

prices the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts 

​ 

to supplement the financial information included in this report we have presented adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps each of which is considered a nongaap financial measure 

​ 

our management uses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps to evaluate the company’s performance excluding the impact of certain noncash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods we include these nongaap financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when used in conjunction with gaap financial measures is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the company’s operating performance and underlying prospects these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as alternatives for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures the same way these measures are not a substitute for their comparable gaap financial measures such as net income loss or diluted earnings per share and there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures

​ 

the following table reconciles net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures

​

 ​ 

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act in fiscal 2018 we decreased income tax expense and increased net income 284 million or 019 per share for onetime items including a 399 million net provisional tax benefit from the estimated impact of remeasuring our net us deferred tax liabilities with a new lower us federal statutory rate partially offset by an 115 million transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings 

​ 

critical accounting estimates 

​ 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to our trade promotions income taxes and acquisitions among others we base our estimates on historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

​ 

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results these estimates require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

​ 

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

​ 

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions sales promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives the estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and redemption rates influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories

​ 

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products the costs of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability the estimate of trade promotions is inherently difficult due to information limitations as the products move beyond distributors and through the supply chain to operators estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities current and past tradepromotion spending patterns the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs

​ 

the determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer promotion participation particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event because of the complexity of some of these trade promotions the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from our estimates as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates at may 31 2020 and may 26 2019 we had 425 million and 486 million respectively of sales incentives and trade promotions payable recorded in “accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets

​ 

income taxes 

​ 

we compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled

​ 

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes management judgments are required for the following items

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 



 ​ 

while we believe the judgements and estimates discussed above and made by management are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts further information on income taxes is provided in note 3 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

​ 

acquisitions 

​ 

from time to time we may enter into business combinations we allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values fair value is determined using the income approach cost approach and or market approach of inventory property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions among others this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations additionally we expense any acquisitionrelated costs as incurred in connection with each business combination

​ 

significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of brands and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could increase or decrease

​ 

new and recently adopted accounting standards

​ 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

​ 

our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in the normal course of business we periodically enter into derivatives to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes the covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate at the time of this filing we are unable to predict or determine the impacts that the covid19 pandemic may have on our exposure to market risk from commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates among other factors for additional discussion refer to “forwardlooking statements” “liquidity and capital resources” within “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” as well as “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k

​ 

based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of may 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to “cost of sales” of approximately 96 million 74 million net of income tax benefit it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item

​ 

at may 31 2020 we had 21660 million of fixedrate and 13890 million of variablerate debt outstanding we have interest rate risk associated with our variablerate debt a one percent increase in interest rates related to variablerate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately 141 million annually 108 million net of income tax benefit

​ 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

​ 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

​ 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

​ 

as disclosed in part ii item 9a controls and procedures in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended may 26 2019 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we identified a material weakness in internal control related to information technology general controls in the area of application support team access to an information technology system “it system” that supports process controls and information used in our financial reporting processes during fiscal 2020 management implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included enhancing our communication of internal control responsibilities to ensure the timely termination of access to the it system when granted on a temporary basis to authorized members of our application support team during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls and found them to be effective as a result we have concluded the material weakness has been remediated as of may 31 2020 

​ 

other than the remediation efforts discussed above there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

trademarks licenses and patents 

  

our trademarks are material to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other geographic markets where the related food items are sold depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use and their registrations are maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms our significant trademarks include lamb weston lamb’s supreme lamb weston seeing possibilities in potatoes and design lamb’s seasoned lw private reserve stealth fries and sweet things we also sell certain products such as grown in idaho and alexia  which we license from third parties 

  

we own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions including packaging manufacturing processes equipment formulations and designs our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while we consider our patent portfolio to be material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

raw materials and packaging 

  

our primary raw materials are potatoes edible oils and packaging we source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic longterm grower relationships and shorterterm annual contracts in the united states most of the potato crop used in our products is grown in washington idaho and oregon for lambwestonmeijer european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands austria belgium germany france and the united kingdom we also have growing regions in china and australia we believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs yeartoyear we source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers and we source energy and packaging materials through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types 

  

the prices paid for these raw materials as well as other raw materials used in making our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply 

  

from time to time we have faced increased costs for our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through longterm relationships contract strategies and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists as well as through our productivity and pricing initiatives 

  

manufacturing 

  

we operate 17 manufacturing facilities for our products see item 2 properties for more information about our manufacturing facilities 

  

in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we source a portion of our products under “copacking” agreements a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies we regularly evaluate our copacking arrangements to ensure the most costeffective manufacturing of our products and to utilize companyowned manufacturing facilities most effectively 

international operations 

  

at may 26 2019 we had operations in twelve countries with manufacturing and processing facilities in four countries foreign net sales including sales by domestic segments to customers located outside of the united states were approximately 7427 million 6658 million and 6635 million in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively our longlived assets located outside of the united states are not significant see note 15 segments of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k for additional information on our us and nonus operations also see “item 2 properties” for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states see “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

  

backlog 

  

we manufacture primarily to fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders due to the seasonal nature of our manufacturing activities and associated inventory such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

  

competition 

  

the valueadded frozen potato products industry in north america europe and other international markets is highly competitive competitors include large north american and european frozen potato product companies that compete globally as well as local and regional companies significant competitors include mccain foods limited jr simplot company cavendish farms corporation the kraft heinz company clarebout potatoes nv aviko bv agristo nv farm frites international bv and mydibel sa some of our competitors are larger and have substantially more financial sales and marketing and other resources we compete with producers of similar products on the basis of among other things customer service value product innovation product quality brand recognition and loyalty price and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences the markets in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future see also “item 1a risk factors – increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits” of this form 10k 

  

seasonality 

  

our product contribution margin percentage inventory levels net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality in general our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter reflecting the benefit of freshlyharvested potatoes we typically harvest potatoes in the pacific northwest of the united states in july through october which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter freshlyharvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs we typically hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory on a firstinfirstout basis so the relatively favorable costs primarily incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter requiring more working capital at that time in general net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2019 we had approximately 7600 employees excluding our joint ventures approximately 700 of these employees work outside of the united states approximately 32 of our hourly employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate most of the union workers at our facilities are represented under contracts that expire at various times throughout the next several years approximately 32 expire in fiscal 2020 as these agreements expire we believe they will be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future 

  

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

  

our business valueadded frozen potato products is highly competitive our principal competitors have substantial financial sales and marketing and other resources a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing increasing promotional activity or losing market share competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

  

increased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits 

  

in recent years market demand for valueadded frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products as additional industry capacity comes online or market demand otherwise decreases we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations including foreign currency risks and trade barriers 

  

we conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the united states including through our joint ventures during each of fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 net sales outside the united states primarily in canada japan china korea mexico and taiwan accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales these amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures which are also subject to risks associated with international operations 

  

many factors relating to our international sales and operations many of which factors are outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations including 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

disruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to serve our customers globally we rely in part on our international joint venture partnerships but also on exports from the united states during fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 export sales from the united states accounted for approximately 16 17 and 19 respectively of our total net sales circumstances beyond our control such as a labor dispute at a port could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities we have access to production overseas through our facilities in australia canada and china and a joint venture in europe but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms if this occurs we may be unable to adequately supply all of our customer opportunities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the separation as of may 26 2019 we had 23182 million of longterm debt including current portion recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur additional substantial debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

  



  



  



  



  



  

the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business 

  

the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability to 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations in addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing 

  

additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs further under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with conagra at the separation we may not retire repurchase or significantly modify our senior notes during the fiveyear period following the spinoff 

  

our business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region 

  

ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our valueadded products eg french fries are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally in the united states most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in washington idaho and oregon european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands austria belgium germany france and the united kingdom recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions but the capitalintensive nature of our industry’s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions unfavorable crop conditions in any one region such as the drought in europe during our fiscal year 2019 could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability 

  

our business is affected by potato crop performance 

  

our primary input is potatoes and every year we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into valueadded products environmental and climate conditions such as soil quality moisture and temperature affect the quality of the potato crop on a yeartoyear basis as a result we source potatoes from specific regions of the united states and specific countries abroad including australia austria belgium france germany the netherlands the united kingdom canada and china where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist however severe weather conditions during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance such as the drought in europe during our fiscal year 2019 potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure decreased yields and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes we have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop however if a weather or pestrelated event occurs in a particular crop year and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our customer opportunities and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease alternatively overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and oversupply an increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss 

  

increases in commodity and other input costs may have a negative impact on profits 

  

a significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as oil and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations in addition we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products commodity price increases or constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities including necessary services such as transportation and warehousing may increase our operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and decreased profitability there is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the united states although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases as a result the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

  

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category our profitability could decrease 

  

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative functions however gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position 

  

changes in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us 

  

we expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers in some instances we have entered into longterm agreements with growers however a portion of our potato needs are typically sourced on an annual basis to the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our longterm growers contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities to obtain sufficient potato supply we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected or forgo sales to some market segments which would reduce our profitability if we forgo sales to such market segments we may lose customers and may not be able to replace them later 

changes in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us 

  

we maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments customers include global national and regional quick serve and fast casual restaurants as well as small independently operated restaurants multinational broadline foodservice distributors as well as regional foodservice distributors and major food retailers some of these customers independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales while we contract annually or biannually with many of our foodservice customers loss of a significant customer could materially impact the business in addition shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation accounted for approximately 10 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019 and 11 of our consolidated net sales in both 2018 and 2017 there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

  

some of our customers are large and sophisticated with buying power and negotiating strength these customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition some of these customers eg larger distributors and supermarkets have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality however if we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers our profitability could decline 

  

we must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences and trends 

  

consumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences we need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences for example as consumers focus on freshly prepared foods some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens as a result we would need to evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment in addition our products contain carbohydrates sodium genetically modified ingredients added sugars saturated fats and preservatives the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny we must continue to reformulate our products introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste texture and appearance that consumers demand in valueadded potato products all of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

a portion of our business is and several of our growth strategies are conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit 

  

we have built our company in part through the creation of joint ventures some of which we do not control in these relationships we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners rather than our exclusive benefit through our extensive experience in operating a portion of our business through joint ventures we understand that joint ventures often require additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decisionmaking if our joint venture partners take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture or disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those actions or decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted 

  

if we are unable to complete potential acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives integrate acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

  

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include i diversion of management attention from existing businesses ii difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems iii difficulties implementing effective control environment processes iv adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers v inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings vi potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and vii indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers if we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects such as new production lines our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

  

new regulations imposed by the fda or efsa around acrylamide formation in french fried potato products could adversely affect us 

  

the regulation of food products both within the united states and internationally continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny the presence andor formation of acrylamide in french fried potato products has become a global regulatory issue as both the fda and the european food safety authority “efsa” have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give “browned foods” their desirable flavor acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet including but not limited to breads toast cookies coffee crackers potatoes and olives the regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control temperature and material testing low sugar and low asparagine however limits for acrylamide content have been established for some food types in the state of california and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits in addition the efsa has recently promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products if the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and additional legal limits are established our manufacturing costs could increase in addition if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation sales of our products could decrease 

  

if we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

  

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the us department of agriculture the fda the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products 

  

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

litigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are or may become party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability product recalls product liability product claims employment matters environmental matters or other aspects of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business 

  

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances which would cause us to incur associated costs those costs could be meaningful we may also be subject to litigation requests for indemnification from our customers or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury illness or death a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

  

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

damage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our customers rely on us and our comanufacturers to manufacture safe high quality food products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may damage the reputation of our customers and ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

  

our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for our operations and activities our research and development efforts our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management our failure to comply with local laws and regulations our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in 

decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

  

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

  

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

  

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

  

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements despite careful security and controls design implementation updating and independent thirdparty verification our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers or suppliers 

  

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations potentially significant fines and penalties damage to our reputation and credibility loss of strategic opportunities and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may face business interruptions litigation and financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or customers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

  

we intend to replace our information technology infrastructure and plan to implement a new enterprise resource planning system problems with the transition design or implementation of this upgrade could interfere with our business and operations and adversely affect our financial condition 

  

we are currently in the process of replacing our information technology infrastructure with a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system which we expect to implement during fiscal 2021 we may experience difficulties as we transition to new upgraded systems and processes these difficulties may include loss of data difficulty in processing customer orders shipping products or providing services and support to our customers difficulty in billing and tracking our orders difficulty in completing financial reporting and filing reports with the sec in a timely manner or challenges in otherwise running our business we may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the transition design and implementation of a new erp system particularly any disruptions delays or deficiencies that impact our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we do not encounter adverse effects the transition design and implementation of a new erp system may be much more costly than we anticipated 

  

we identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls which if not remediated appropriately or timely could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in “part ii item 9a controls and procedures” of this form 10k when assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of may 26 2019 management identified a material weakness in an internal control over the timely termination of temporary access to an information technology system that supports our financial reporting processes that was granted to certain authorized members of our application support team as a result we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of may 26 2019 we are implementing remedial measures and while there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful we plan to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal 2020 if we are unable to remediate the material weakness or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected 

  

if we were unable to prepare our future financial statements in conformity with us gaap as required such circumstances would expose us to potential events of default if not cured or waived under the financial and operating covenants contained in our various debt instruments and cause us to seek any necessary consents waivers or amendments from our lenders under such circumstances we would face the risk that we may not be able to obtain any such consents waivers or amendments that the terms of any such consents waivers or amendments might be less favorable than the current terms of our indebtedness or we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness to enable us to repay that indebtedness when it becomes due also if we were unable to prepare our future financial statements in conformity with us gaap as required it could result in damage to our reputation or lead to regulatory proceedings or private litigation any or all of which could result in additional business disruptions and the company incurring potentially substantial costs and our stock price could be adversely impacted 

  

accordingly if we are unable to remediate the material weakness in the future or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures such events could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

  

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not 

absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met as noted in our material weakness described above the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline 

  

if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience as well as finance marketing and other senior management professionals the market for these employees is competitive and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business if we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new highquality employees our business could be materially and adversely affected 

  

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

  

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as potatoes and oils in addition water is an important part of potato processing we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases as well as more stringent regulation of water rights in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions improve our energy efficiency and reduce and reuse water we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

  

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

  

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

  



  



  



  



  



  

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

  

as of may 26 2019 we had goodwill of 2059   million and other intangibles of 376   million the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of brands trademarks licensing agreements customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth

executive summary 

  

we delivered strong financial results in fiscal 2019 reflecting the favorable operating environment and our focus on delivering our strategic and operational objectives specifically in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

  





























  

demand for frozen potato products continues to grow around the world we expect to address the increase in demand by investing in additional capacity we began operating a new processing line in boardman oregon during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as well as a new line in richland washington during the second quarter of fiscal 2018   in addition our new line in hermiston oregon with a total annual production capacity of approximately 300 million pounds became operational in may 2019 during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we purchased the remaining interest in our lamb weston bsw joint venture and acquired a frozen potato processor in australia which added approximately 50 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network in july 2019 we acquired another frozen potato processor in australia which added approximately 70 million pounds of production capacity to our manufacturing network lambwestonmeijer our joint venture in europe recently expanded capacity at its facility at bergen op zoom the netherlands and in june 2017 acquired the potato processing business of oerlemans foods which included a potato processing facility located in broekhuizenvorst the netherlands lambwestonmeijer is also party to a joint venture that constructed a new production facility in lipetsk a special economic zone in south moscow the russian federation which began operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 

  

markets 

  

we operate in the global valueadded frozen potato products industry with the majority of our sales derived from products sold to customers in north america and the remainder sold to customers primarily in asia europe latin america oceania and the middle east 

  

in general demand for frozen potato products grew steadily in fiscal 2019 in north america volume demand growth was driven by quick service restaurant chains “qsrs” as well as in retail channels outside north america demand growth was driven by increased access to consumers through continued expansion in these markets by both north americabased qsrs local qsrs and other chain and independent restaurants in emerging markets demand growth was also driven by increased affordability due to higher per capita incomes and increased appeal of westernstyle food offerings and diets 

  

in this environment of growing volume demand there was limited available capacity in north america to produce frozen potato products in fiscal 2019 which led to increased raw potato costs across the industry in europe a poor potato crop resulted in higher manufacturing costs 

  

outlook   

  

in fiscal 2020 we expect the overall operating environment will be generally favorable with continued solid demand growth in north america and our key international markets new industry capacity in north america and europe may ease nearterm capacity constraints and will allow processors to operate their production facilities at more normalized levels in addition we expect the rate of inflation for many of our commodity and manufacturing costs will be similar to fiscal 2019 we also expect higher selling general and administrative costs as a result of investments in our enterprise resource planning infrastructure as well as for continued improvements in our information systems sales marketing innovation operations and other functional capabilities designed to drive operating efficiencies and support future growth 

  

results of operations 

  

we have four reportable segments global foodservice retail and other for each period presented we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance we define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses product contribution margin excludes general corporate expenses and interest expense because management believes these amounts are not directly associated with segment performance for the period for additional information on our reportable segments see note 15 segments of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k 

fiscal year ended may 26 2019 compared to fiscal year ended may 27 2018 

  

net sales and product contribution margin dollars in millions 

  



  

net sales 

  

lamb weston’s net sales for fiscal 2019 increased 3328 million or 10 to 37565 million compared with 34237 million in fiscal 2018 net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5 increase in volume and 5 increase in pricemix primarily driven by growth in our global segment 

  

global net sales increased 2173 million or 12 to 19615 million compared with 17442 million in fiscal 2018 net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7 increase in sales volumes driven by growth in sales to strategic customers in the us and key international markets as well as the benefit of limited time product offerings pricemix increased 5 largely reflecting pricing actions and favorable customer mix 

  

foodservice net sales increased 570 million or 5 to 11561 million compared with 10991 million in fiscal 2018 net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 5 increase primarily reflecting pricing actions initiated in the fall of 2018 as well as improved mix sales volume declined nominally as the loss of some distributor and operatorlabel product volumes essentially offset growth in branded products 

  

retail net sales increased 491 million or 11 to 4983 million compared with 4492 million in fiscal 2018 net sales in fiscal 2019 reflect a 7 increase in sales volume primarily driven by distribution gains of grown in idaho and other branded products pricemix increased 4 largely due to improved mix and pricing actions 

  

net sales in our other segment increased 94 million or 7 to 1406 million compared with 1312 million in fiscal 2018 the increase primarily reflects higher pricemix in our vegetable business 

  

product contribution margin 

  

lamb weston’s product contribution margin for fiscal 2019 increased 1232 million or 15 to 9711 million compared with 8479 million in fiscal 2018 

  

global product contribution margin increased 706 million or 19 to 4463 million in fiscal 2019 as a result of favorable price mix volume and supply chain efficiency savings which more than offset input manufacturing and transportation cost inflation as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new production line in richland washington global cost of sales was 15084 million or 11 higher in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 largely due to higher sales volume cost inflation and higher depreciation expense partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings advertising and promotion spending was modestly higher in 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 

  

foodservice product contribution margin increased 365 million or 10 to 4024 million in fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of favorable pricemix and supply chain efficiency savings which more than offset input manufacturing and transportation cost inflation as well as higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the new richland production line cost of sales was 7460 million or 3 higher in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 largely 

due to cost inflation and higher depreciation expense partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings advertising and promotion spending declined approximately 1 million in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

  

retail product contribution margin increased 115 million or 13 to 988 million in fiscal 2019 due to volume growth and favorable pricemix more than offsetting input manufacturing and transportation cost inflation cost of sales was 3819 million or 10 higher in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 largely due to higher sales volume and cost inflation advertising and promotion spending was 16 million higher in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 primarily in support of grown in idaho and other branded products 

  

other product contribution margin increased 46 million to 236 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to 190 million in fiscal 2018 these amounts include a 33 million loss related to unrealized marktomarket adjustments and realized settlements associated with commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019 and a 11 million gain related to the contracts in fiscal 2018 excluding these adjustments other segment product contribution margin increased 90 million largely due to improved pricemix in our vegetable business 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 357 million or 12 in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 fiscal 2018 included 87 million 57 million aftertax for costs related to the separation primarily related to professional fees and other employeerelated costs 

  

excluding the separation costs fiscal 2019 sga expenses increased 444 million or 15 versus the prior year the increase in sga expenses excluding comparability items was largely driven by higher expenses related to information technology services and infrastructure as well as investments in our sales marketing and operating capabilities the increase was also driven by approximately 8 million of unfavorable foreign exchange reflecting an approximate 3 million expense in fiscal 2019 compared to an approximate 5 million benefit in fiscal 2018  an approximate 2 million increase in incentive compensation expense that primarily reflected an increase in stock price and absolute shares outstanding and an approximate 1 million increase in advertising and promotional support partially offset by an approximate 4 million benefit from an insurance settlement 

  

interest expense net 

  

interest expense net was 1071 million in fiscal 2019 a decrease of 17 million compared with fiscal 2018 the decrease in interest expense net was the result of lower average total debt versus the prior year 

  

for more information see note 9 debt and financing obligations of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k for the period prior to the separation interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the lamb weston business and did not include any allocated interest expense from conagra 

  

income taxes 

  

income tax expense in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 was impacted by the tax act enacted in december 2017 notably the tax act reduced the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 assessed a onetime transition tax on earnings of nonus subsidiaries that have not been taxed previously in the us limited the tax deductibility of interest provided for immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time modified or repealed many business deductions and credits and created new taxes on certain future foreignsourced earnings 

a reconciliation of income tax expense including the impact of the comparability items recorded in fiscal 2019 and 2018 related to the tax act is as follows in millions

equity method investment earnings 

  

we conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them lamb weston’s share of earnings from its equity method investments was 595 million and 836 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively these amounts included a 26 million unrealized loss related to marktomarket adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in fiscal 2019 and a nominal unrealized loss related to the contracts in fiscal 2018 excluding these adjustments earnings from equity method investments declined 216 million compared to fiscal 2018 largely reflecting higher raw potato prices and lower sales volumes associated with a poor crop in europe for more information about our joint ventures see note 7 investments in joint ventures of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k 

  

acquisition of remaining 5001 interest in lamb weston bsw 

  

on november 2 2018 we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement the “bsw agreement” with ochoa ag unlimited foods inc “ochoa” to acquire the remaining 5001 interest in lamb weston bsw a potato processing joint venture we paid ochoa approximately 65 million in cash attributable to our contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in lamb weston bsw plus 132 million attributable to ochoa’s interest in expected earnings of the joint venture through our fiscal year ended may 26 2019 

  

prior to entering into the bsw agreement lamb weston bsw was considered a variable interest entity and we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of the entity accordingly we consolidated the financial statements of lamb weston bsw and deducted 5001 of the operating results of the noncontrolling interests to arrive at “net income 

attributable to lamb weston holdings inc” on our combined and consolidated statements of earnings the combined and consolidated statements of earnings include 100 of lamb weston bsw’s earnings beginning november 2 2018 the date we entered into the bsw agreement 

  

prior to entering into the bsw agreement the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet based on the value of ochoa’s put option in connection with the purchase of the remaining 5001 interest in the joint venture we recorded 94 million of accretion net of tax benefits to increase the redeemable noncontrolling interest to the amount we agreed to pay the purchase created 93 million of deferred tax assets related to the stepup in tax basis of the acquired assets we recorded both the accretion of the noncontrolling interest and the related tax benefits in “additional distributed capital” on our consolidated balance sheet and they did not impact net income while the accretion net of tax benefits had no impact on net income in the combined and consolidated statements of earnings it reduced net income available to common stockholders 94 million net of tax benefits and both basic and diluted earnings per share 006 during fiscal 2019 

  

acquisition 

  

in december 2018 we acquired a frozen potato processor in australia for 886 million net of cash acquired we allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of the fair value at the date of acquisition of which 751 million was allocated to goodwill operating results of the acquired company subsequent to december 21 2018 have been included in our global segment

global net sales increased 1194 million or 7 to 17442 million compared with 16248 million in fiscal 2017 net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 5 increase in pricemix associated with price increases in both domestic and international markets as well as improved customer and product mix sales volumes increased 2 primarily driven by organic growth and new business with major restaurant chains in north america while net sales in international markets increased nominally sales volumes declined as we chose to improve customer and product mix as well as lower shipments to certain export markets 

  

foodservice net sales increased 691 million or 7 to 10991 million compared with 10300 million in fiscal 2017 net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6 increase related to favorable pricing as well as actions to improve customer and product mix sales volume increased 1 which was primarily related to growth of sales of lamb weston

retail net sales increased 643 million or 17 to 4492 million compared with 3849 million in fiscal 2017 net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 12 increase in sales volume driven by distribution gains of grown in idaho and other branded products as well as increased shipments of private label products pricemix increased 5 reflecting higher prices across the branded and private label portfolios as well as improved mix partially offset by higher trade investments to support expanded distribution of grown in idaho branded products 

  

net sales in our other segment increased 29 million or 2 to 1312 million compared with 1283 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to favorable product mix in our vegetable business

global product contribution margin increased 371 million or 11 to 3757 million in fiscal 2018 as a result of favorable price mix and volume growth global cost of sales was 13618 million or 6 higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 largely due to higher volume input manufacturing transportation and warehousing cost inflation higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in richland washington and higher incentive compensation costs partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings advertising and promotion spending was 09 million higher in 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 

  

foodservice product contribution margin increased 352 million or 11 to 3659 million in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of favorable pricemix cost of sales was 7247 million or 5 higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 largely due to input manufacturing transportation and warehousing cost inflation higher depreciation expense primarily related to our new french fry production line in richland washington and higher compensation costs partially offset by supply chain efficiency savings advertising and promotion spending was 16 million higher in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

  

retail product contribution margin increased 97 million or 13 to 873 million in fiscal 2018 due to favorable pricemix and higher sales volumes cost of sales was 3460 million or 16 higher in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 largely due to higher volume and transportation warehousing input and manufacturing cost inflation advertising and promotion spending was 65 million higher in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 as we invested behind the introduction of grown in idaho branded products  

  

other product contribution margin increased 97 million to 190 million in fiscal 2018 as compared to 93 million in fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to a change in unrealized marktomarket adjustments of approximately 4 million related to our commodity option contracts and an expense in the prior year related to a recall of some vegetable products that were produced by a third party 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

sga expenses increased 389 million or 15 in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 fiscal 2018 and 2017 included 87 million 57 million aftertax and 265 million 167 million aftertax of expenses for costs related to the separation primarily related to professional fees and other employeerelated costs fiscal 2017 also included a 31 million 20 million aftertax noncash gain on assets excluding these items fiscal 2018 sga expenses increased 536 million or 23 versus the prior year largely due to incremental costs associated with being a standalone public company higher incentive compensation costs based on operating performance and a 90 million increase in advertising and promotional support in addition the increase in sga expenses also included approximately 5 million to establish a new lamb weston charitable foundation and approximately 4 million of costs related to transitioning our foodservice segment gotomarket strategy from a brokerled sales model to a direct sales model 

  

interest expense net 

  

interest expense net was 1088 million in fiscal 2018 an increase of 476 million compared with fiscal 2017 the increase in interest expense net was the result of recognizing interest expense for a fullyear for the debt incurred in connection with the separation compared with recognizing approximately only seven months of interest expense on this debt during fiscal 2017 

  

for more information see note 9 debt and financing obligations of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k for the period prior to the separation interest expense was included for only the legal entities that comprised the lamb weston business and did not include any allocated interest expense from conagra 

  

income taxes 

  





  

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act in fiscal 2018 income tax expense decreased 647 million 363 million of the decrease related to a lower us corporate tax rate and 284 million related to the provisional impacts of the tax act that was enacted in december 2017 for further information on the tax act and its impact see note 5 income taxes of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k 

  

equity method investment earnings

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in fiscal 2019 cash from operations increased 1997 million to 6809 million in addition to using cash for normal operating requirements we invested in our business and returned cash to shareholders in fiscal 2019 we spent 3342 million on capital expenditures including the construction of a new french fry line in hermiston oregon that 

added 300 million pounds of additional annualized production capacity we also used cash for acquisitions we expanded our global footprint with the acquisition of a frozen potato processor in australia for 886 million net of cash acquired and we purchased the remaining interest in our lamb weston bsw joint venture for 782 million finally we returned cash to shareholders including 1133 million in dividends and we repurchased 458749 shares of our common stock for 318 million we ended the year with 122 million of cash and cash equivalents and 4894 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures dividends on our common stock acquisitions debt service income tax payments and stock repurchases   

  

we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payment of any dividends declared on our common stock for at least the next twelve months 

  

cash flows

operating activities 

  

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017

accrued expenses relating to employee compensation and accrued interest in fiscal 2018 and the timing of payments for accounts payable these cash outflows were offset partially by lower payments for income taxes primarily related to the tax act

investing activities used 4230 million of cash in fiscal 2019 compared with 3068 million in fiscal 2018 these expenditures include the plant capacity expansions in hermiston oregon in fiscal 2019 and richland washington in fiscal 2018 additionally in december 2018 we acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of a frozen potato processor in australia for 886 million net of cash acquired 

  

we expect capital investments in fiscal 2020 to be approximately 275   million which excludes acquisitions these expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors including our financial results future economic conditions and our regulatory compliance requirements at may 26 2019 we had commitments for capital expenditures of 415 million

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of may 26 2019 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

investments in joint ventures 

  

lamb weston has interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities but for which we are not the primary beneficiary we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities for more information about our investments in joint ventures see note 7 investments in joint ventures of the notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

  

obligations and commitments 

  

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements potato supply agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum 

prices the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available 

  

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 26 2019 are as follows the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table are estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts 

  

to supplement the financial information included in this report we have presented adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps each of which is considered a nongaap financial measure 

  

lamb weston’s management uses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps to evaluate the company’s performance excluding the impact of certain noncash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods the company includes these nongaap financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when used in conjunction with gaap financial measures is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the company’s operating performance and underlying prospects these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as alternatives for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures the same way these measures are not a substitute for their comparable gaap financial measures such as net income loss or diluted earnings per share and there are limitations to using non‑gaap financial measures 

  

the following table reconciles net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures 

  





  

fiscal 2017 includes a 31 million noncash gain on assets 

  

fiscal 2016 includes 595 million of charges reflecting lamb weston’s portion of actuarial losses in excess of 10 of conagra’s pension liability for conagra sponsored plans 

  

fiscal 2016 and 2015 include 01 million and 07 million respectively related to costs incurred in connection with conagra’s initiative to improve selling general and administrative effectiveness and efficiencies which is referred to as the supply chain and administrative efficiency plan “scae plan” 

  



  



  

the following table reconciles diluted earnings per share to adjusted diluted eps 

  





  



  



  



  

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act in fiscal 2018 we decreased income tax expense and increased net income 284 million or 019 per share for onetime items including a 399 million net provisional tax benefit from the estimated impact of remeasuring our net us deferred tax liabilities with a new lower us federal statutory rate partially offset by an 115 million transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings 

  



  

critical accounting estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s combined and consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to our trade promotions income taxes and acquisitions among others we base our estimates on historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results these estimates require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

  

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

  

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions sales promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives the estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and coupon utilization and redemption rates influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories 

  

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products the cost of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates made at the time of shipment or coupon release the estimate of trade promotions is inherently difficult due to information limitations as the products move beyond distributors and through the supply chain to operators estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities current and past tradepromotion spending patterns the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs 

  

the determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer promotion participation particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event because of the complexity of some of these trade promotions the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are different from our estimates as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates at may 26 2019 and may 27 2018 we had 486 million and 454 million respectively of sales incentives and trade promotions payable recorded in “accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

income taxes 

  

we compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 

  

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes management judgments are required for the following items 

  



  



  



  

while we believe the judgements and estimates discussed above and made by management are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts further information on income taxes is provided in note 5 income taxes of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

  

acquisitions 

  

from time to time we may enter into business combinations we allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values fair value is determined using the income approach cost approach and or market approach of inventory property plant and equipment identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions among others this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations additionally we expense any acquisitionrelated costs as incurred in connection with each business combination 

  

significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of brands and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to 

develop these values we could record impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could increase or decrease 

  

new and recently adopted accounting standards 

  

for a listing of our new and recently adopted accounting standards see note 1 nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10‑k 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in the normal course of business we periodically enter into derivatives to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes 

  

based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of may 26 2019 a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to “cost of sales” of approximately 91 million 70 million net of income tax benefit it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 

  

at may 26 2019 we had 16660 million of fixedrate and 6075 million of variablerate debt outstanding we have interest rate risk associated with our variablerate debt a one percent increase in interest rates related to variablerate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately 62   million annually 47 million net of income tax benefit

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a‑15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended  the “exchange act”  as of may 26 2019 based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which is described below 

  

following identification of the material weakness and prior to the filing of this form 10k management performed additional substantive procedures for the year ended may 26 2019 taking these additional procedures into account management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” further our ceo and cfo have certified that based on their knowledge the financial statements and other financial information included in this form 10k fairly present in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company as of and for the periods presented in this form 10k in addition kpmg llp issued an unqualified opinion on our combined and consolidated financial statements which is   included in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

  

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

  

 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets 

  

 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 

  

 provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with management and director authorization 

  

 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements and 

  

 provide reasonable assurance as to the detection of fraud 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

  

our management under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and oversight of the board of directors assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of may 26 2019 management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management identified a material weakness in information technology general controls “itgcs” in the area of application support team access to an information technology system “it system” that supports process controls and information used in our financial reporting processes as a result of this itgc deficiency automated controls that depend on the effective operation of the itgcs and manual business process controls that are dependent upon the completeness and accuracy of information derived from the affected it system were also considered to be ineffective 

  

t he material weakness resulted from ineffective communication of internal control responsibilities that prevented the timely termination of temporary access to the it system that was granted to certain authorized members of our application support team  the material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements and there were no changes to previously released financial results however because the material weakness creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis management concluded that as of may 26 2019 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective 

  

our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting their report is included in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

  

remediation 

  

management is taking steps to remediate the itgc deficiency including enhancing its communication of internal control responsibilities to ensure the timely termination of access to the it system when granted on a temporary basis to authorized members of our application support team t he weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable control operates for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that the control objective is achieved we expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2020 

  

if the remedial measures described above are insufficient to address the identified material weakness or are not implemented effectively or additional deficiencies arise in the future it is possible that material misstatements in our interim or annual financial statements could occur in the future in addition any such unremediated material weakness could have the effects described in “item 1a risk factors” in this form 10k 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

except for the material weakness identified during the quarter ended may 26 2019 there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f or 15d15f of the exchange act that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

we were organized as a delaware corporation in july 2016 as a wholly owned subsidiary of conagra brands inc formerly conagra foods inc “conagra” on november 9 2016 we separated from conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by conagra of 100 of our outstanding common stock to conagra stockholders “separation” or “spinoff” each conagra stockholder of record on november 1 2016 “record date” received one share of our common stock for every three shares of conagra common stock held on the record date as a result of the separation approximately 146 million shares of our common stock were distributed on november 9 2016 to conagra stockholders on november 10 2016 our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “lw” on the new york stock exchange “nyse” 

  

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with conagra including a transition services agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and trademark license agreement these agreements govern the relationship between us and conagra following the separation and provide for the allocation of various assets liabilities rights and obligations of the parties these agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by conagra to lamb weston for a discussion of these agreements see the section entitled “relationship with conagra after the spinoff” in our registration statement on form 10 as amended as filed with the sec on october 17 2016 “form 10” and note 3 related party transactions 

 

of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k in april 2018 we concluded our transition services agreement with conagra 

  

in connection with the separation conagra transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the lamb weston business to us combined financial statements for lamb weston for periods prior to the separation were prepared on a standalone basis and were derived from conagra’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records the combined financial statements for lamb weston contained in this report for periods prior to the separation reflect our financial position results of operations comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of conagra prior to the separation and include allocations for a portion of conagra’s shared corporate general and administrative expenses following the separation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lamb weston holdings inc its wholly owned subsidiaries and lamb weston bsw llc which we own a 4999 interest in but we consolidate because we are the primary beneficiary the combined financial position results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate standalone public company during the periods presented nor are they indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be in the future information related to the separation and its effect on our financial statements are discussed throughout this form 10‑k

sales distribution and customers 

  

we benefit from strong relationships with a diverse set of customers we sell our products through a combined network of internal sales personnel and independent brokers agents and distributors to chain restaurants wholesale grocery mass merchants club specialty retailers and foodservice distributors and institutions including businesses educational institutions independent restaurants regional chain restaurants and convenience stores we have longtenured relationships with leading quick service and fast casual restaurants global foodservice distributors large grocery retailers and mass merchants 

  

our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation accounted for approximately 11 of our consolidated “net sales” in each of fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 no other customer accounted for more than 10 of our fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016 consolidated net sales accounts receivable from another customer accounted for 12 of our consolidated accounts receivable at may 27 2018 accounts receivable from an additional customer accounted for 10 of our consolidated accounts receivable at may 28 2017   

  

international operations 

  

at may 27 2018 we had operations in twelve countries with manufacturing and processing facilities in three countries foreign net sales including sales by domestic segments to customers located outside of the united states and canada were approximately 6658 million 6635 million and 6159 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively our longlived assets located outside of the united states are not significant see note 13 segments of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k for additional information on our us and nonus operations also see “item 2 properties” for more information on our manufacturing and other facilities for a discussion of risks related to our operations outside the united states see “item 1a risk factors” of this form 10k 

  

 

research and development 

  

we leverage our research and development resources for both growth and efficiency initiatives we seek to drive growth through innovation by creating new products enhancing the quality of existing products and participating in joint menu planning exercises with our customers we also emphasize sustainability in our research and development activities and continue to drive processing innovations aimed at reducing waste and water usage research and development expense was 135 million 106 million and 67 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

  

raw materials and packaging 

  

our primary raw materials are potatoes edible oils energy and packaging we source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic longterm grower relationships and shorterterm annual contracts in the united states most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in idaho oregon and washington for lambwestonmeijer european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands belgium germany france the united kingdom and china we believe that the grower networks to which we have access provide a sufficient source of raw potato inputs yeartoyear we source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers and we source energy and packaging materials through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types 

  

the prices paid for these raw materials as well as other raw materials used in making our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply 

  

from time to time we have faced increased costs for our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through longterm relationships contract strategies and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists as well as through our productivity and pricing initiatives 

  

manufacturing 

  

we own and operate 15 manufacturing facilities for our products see item 2 properties for more information about our manufacturing facilities 

  

in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we source a portion of our products under “copacking” agreements a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies we regularly evaluate our copacking arrangements to ensure the most costeffective manufacturing of our products and to utilize companyowned manufacturing facilities most effectively 

  

backlog 

  

we manufacture primarily to fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders due to the seasonal nature of our manufacturing activities and associated inventory such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

  

competition 

  

the valueadded frozen potato products industry in both north america and international markets is highly competitive competitors include large national and international frozen potato product companies as well as local and regional companies significant competitors include mccain foods jr simplot company cavendish farms and the kraft heinz company some of our competitors are larger and have substantially more financial sales and marketing and other resources we compete with producers of similar products on the basis of among other things customer service 

 

value product innovation product quality food safety brand recognition and loyalty price and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences the markets in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future see also “item 1a risk factors – increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits” of this form 10k 

  

trademarks licenses and patents 

  

our trademarks are material to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other geographic markets where the related food items are sold depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use and their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms our significant trademarks include lamb weston lamb’s supreme lamb weston seeing possibilities in potatoes and design lamb’s seasoned lw private reserve stealth fries and sweet things we also sell certain products under brands such as grown in idaho and alexia  which we license from third parties 

  

we own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions including packaging manufacturing processes equipment formulations and designs our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while we consider our patent portfolio to be material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

seasonality 

  

our product contribution margin percentage inventory levels net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality in general our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in our fiscal third quarter reflecting the benefit of freshlyharvested potatoes we typically harvest potatoes in the pacific northwest of the united states in july through october which is primarily in our fiscal second quarter freshlyharvested potatoes process more efficiently in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs we typically hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory on a firstinfirstout basis so the relatively favorable costs primarily incurred from our fiscal second quarter harvest flow through our income statement in our fiscal third quarter inventory levels also tend to be higher in our fiscal third quarter requiring more working capital at that time in general net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in our fiscal fourth quarter reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2018 we had approximately 7200 employees excluding our joint ventures approximately 700 of these employees work outside of the united states approximately 26 of our hourly employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate most of the union workers at our facilities are represented under contracts that expire at various times throughout the next several years approximately 44 expire in fiscal 2019 as these agreements expire we believe they will be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future 

  

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

  

our business valueadded frozen potato products is highly competitive our principal competitors have substantial financial sales and marketing and other resources a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing increasing promotional activity or losing market share competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

  

 

increased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits 

  

in recent years market demand for valueadded frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products as additional industry capacity comes online or market demand otherwise decreases we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations including foreign currency risks and trade barriers 

  

we conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the united states and canada including through our joint ventures during each of fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 net sales outside the united states and canada primarily in japan china korea mexico and taiwan accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales these amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures which are also subject to risks associated with international operations 

  

many factors relating to our international sales and operations many of which factors are outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations including 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



 

  



  



  



  



  



  

any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

disruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to serve our customers globally we rely in part on our international joint venture partnerships but also on exports from the united states during fiscal 2018 export sales accounted for 19 of our total net sales circumstances beyond our control such as a labor dispute at a port could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities we have access to production overseas through our facility in china and joint venture in europe but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms if this occurs we may be unable to adequately supply all of our customer opportunities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the separation as of may 27 2018 we had 23754 million of longterm debt including current portion recorded on our consolidated balance sheet we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur additional substantial debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

  



  



  



  



  



  

 

the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business 

  

the credit agreement governing our term loan and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability to 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations in addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing 

  

additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs 

  

our business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region 

  

ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our valueadded products eg french fries are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally in the united states most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in idaho oregon and washington european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in belgium france germany the netherlands and the united kingdom recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions but the capitalintensive nature of our industry’s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions unfavorable crop conditions in any one region could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability 

  

our business is affected by potato crop performance 

  

our primary input is potatoes and every year we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into valueadded products environmental and climate conditions such as soil quality moisture and 

 

temperature affect the quality of the potato crop on a yeartoyear basis as a result we source potatoes from specific regions of the united states and specific countries abroad including belgium france germany the netherlands the united kingdom canada and china where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist however severe weather conditions during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure decreased yields and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes we have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop however if a weather or pestrelated event occurs in a particular crop year and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our customer opportunities and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease   alternatively overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and oversupply an increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss 

  

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

  

a significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as oil and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price increases will increase our operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and decreased profitability there is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the united states although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases as a result the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

  

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category our profitability could decrease 

  

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels however gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position 

  

changes in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us 

  

we expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers in some instances we have entered into longterm agreements with growers however a portion of our potato needs are typically sourced on an annual basis to the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our longterm growers contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities to obtain sufficient potato supply we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected or forgo sales to some market segments which would reduce our profitability if we forgo sales to such market segments we may lose customers and may not be able to replace them later 

  

changes in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us 

  

we maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments customers include global national and regional quick serve and fast casual restaurants as well as small independently operated restaurants multinational broadline foodservice distributors as well as regional foodservice distributors and major food retailers some of these 

 

customers independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales while we contract annually or biannually with many of our foodservice customers loss of a significant customer could materially impact the business in addition shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed during each of fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation and its affiliates accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

  

some of our customers are large and sophisticated with buying power and negotiating strength these customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition some of these customers eg larger distributors and supermarkets have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality however if we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers our profitability could decline 

  

we must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences and trends 

  

consumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences we need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences for example as consumers focus on freshly prepared foods some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens as a result we would need to evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment in addition our products contain carbohydrates sodium genetically modified ingredients added sugars saturated fats and preservatives the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny we must continue to reformulate our products introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste texture and appearance that consumers demand in valueadded potato products all of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

a portion of our business is and several of our growth strategies are conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit 

  

we have built our company in part through the creation of joint ventures some of which we do not control in these relationships we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners rather than our exclusive benefit through our extensive experience in operating a portion of our business through joint ventures we understand that joint ventures often require additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decisionmaking if our joint venture partners take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture or disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those actions or decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted 

  

if we are unable to complete potential acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives integrate acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

  

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include i diversion of 

 

management attention from existing businesses ii difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems iii difficulties implementing effective control environment processes iv adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers v inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings vi potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and vii indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers if we are unable to complete acquisitions we may identify or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects such as new production lines our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

  

new regulations imposed by the fda or efsa around acrylamide formation in french fried potato products could adversely affect us 

  

the regulation of food products both within the united states and internationally continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny the presence andor formation of acrylamide in french fried potato products has become a global regulatory issue as both the fda and the european food safety authority “efsa” have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give “browned foods” their desirable flavor acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet including but not limited to breads toast cookies coffee crackers potatoes and olives the regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control temperature and material testing low sugar and low asparagine however limits for acrylamide content have been established for some food types in the state of california and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits in addition the efsa has recently promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products if the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and additional legal limits are established our manufacturing costs could increase in addition if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation sales of our products could decrease 

  

if we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

  

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the us department of agriculture the fda the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products 

  

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

litigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are or may become party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability product recalls product liability product claims 

 

employment matters environmental matters or other aspects of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business 

  

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances which would cause us to incur associated costs those costs could be meaningful we may also be subject to litigation requests for indemnification from our customers or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury illness or death a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

  

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

damage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our customers rely on us and our comanufacturers to manufacture safe high quality food products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may damage the reputation of our customers and ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

  

our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for our operations and activities our research and development efforts our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management our failure to comply with local laws and regulations our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

  

 

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

  

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

  

we are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of security 

  

we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements our information technology systems some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties may be vulnerable to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events natural disasters fires power outages systems failures telecommunications failures security breaches computer viruses hackers employee error or malfeasance and other causes increased cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems as well as the confidentiality integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational reputational legal and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or unauthorized disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs fines or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers or suppliers 

  

misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations potentially significant fines and penalties damage to our reputation and credibility loss of strategic opportunities and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net sales in addition we may face business interruptions litigation and financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or customers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems 

  

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

  

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements 

 

due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline 

  

if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience as well as finance marketing and other senior management professionals the market for these employees is competitive and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business if we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new highquality employees our business could be materially and adversely affected 

  

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

  

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as potatoes and oils in addition water is an important part of potato processing we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations the increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases as well as more stringent regulation of water rights in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions improve our energy efficiency and reduce and reuse water we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery as a result climate change could negatively affect our business and operations 

  

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

  

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

  



  



  



  

 



  



  

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

  

as of may 27 2018 we had goodwill of 1351 million and other intangibles of 354   million the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

  

we have a limited operating history as an independent public company and our   historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows nor do they reflect what our financial condition results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented 

  

our historical financial statements do not necessarily reflect what our financial condition results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during certain of the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows for future periods this is primarily a result of the following factors 

  



  



  



  

 

we are subject to significant restrictions under a tax matters agreement 

  

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with conagra the tax matters agreement generally prohibits us during the twoyear period following the spinoff from taking certain actions that could cause the spinoff and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions these restrictions include 

  



  



  



  



  



  

in addition during the fiveyear period following the spinoff we may not retire repurchase or significantly modify our senior notes further more generally we may not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the spinoff and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions under section 368a1d and section 355 of the code if we take any of the actions above and the actions result in taxrelated losses to conagra we generally will be required to indemnify conagra for such taxrelated losses under the tax matters agreement due to these restrictions and indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement we may be limited in our ability to pursue strategic transactions equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in our best interests also our potential indemnity obligation to conagra might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable 

  

if the spinoff is taxable to conagra as a result of a breach by us of any covenant or representation made by us in the tax matters agreement we will generally be required to indemnify conagra the obligation to make a payment on this indemnification obligation could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

it was intended that the spinoff together with certain related transactions would qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the code and a taxfree distribution within the meaning of section 355 of the code in connection with the spinoff conagra received an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that those transactions will qualify for their intended tax treatment however an opinion of tax counsel does not preclude the internal revenue service “irs” or the courts from adopting a contrary position the tax opinion relied on certain representations covenants and assumptions including those relating to our and conagra’s past and future conduct if any of those representations covenants or assumptions is inaccurate the tax consequences of the spinoff could differ from the intended tax treatment if the spinoff andor certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment for any reason conagra andor holders of its common stock would be subject to tax as a result of the spinoff and certain related transactions 

  

if the spinoff andor the related transactions are not treated as taxfree transactions or are taxable to conagra due to a breach by us or any of our subsidiaries of any covenant or representation made by us in the tax matters agreement we will generally be required to indemnify conagra for all taxrelated losses suffered by conagra in connection with the spinoff in addition we will not control the resolution of any tax contest relating to taxes suffered by conagra in connection 

 

with the spinoff and we may not control the resolution of tax contests relating to any other taxes for which we may ultimately have an indemnity obligation under the tax matters agreement in the event that conagra suffers taxrelated losses in connection with the spinoff that must be indemnified by us under the tax matters agreement the indemnification liability could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities following the spinoff including potential indemnification liabilities to conagra and these liabilities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with conagra that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions required to effect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and conagra with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to the lamb weston business whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff and whether known or unknown at the time of the spinoff as well as those obligations of conagra assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement if we are required to indemnify conagra under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement or meaningful unknown liabilities surface we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

  

in addition under the code and applicable treasury regulations each corporation that was a member of the conagra consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the completion of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire conagra consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period similar rules may apply for state local and nonus tax purposes in addition the tax matters agreement with conagra allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of any conagra consolidated combined unitary or other tax reporting group between us and conagra however if conagra is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible under the tax matters agreement we could be required to pay the entire amount of those taxes which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

in connection with the spinoff conagra agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that conagra’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future 

  

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement conagra agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conagra has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from conagra will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of those liabilities or that conagra will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conagra any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves if conagra is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

further conagra’s insurers may deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from such insurance providers we may be required to temporarily bear such loss of coverage

executive summary 

  

we had strong performance in fiscal 2018 our financial results reflected the favorable operating environment that the company has enjoyed over the past couple years our results also reflect our focus on delivering our strategic and operational objectives through an ongoing commitment to support our customers’ growth by investing in additional capacity maintaining high levels of service and developing innovative products and limited time offerings specifically in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

  





 























  

demand for frozen potato products continues to grow around the world we expect to meet the increase in demand by investing in additional capacity we began operating a new production line in richland washington and boardman oregon during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively and we expect to begin operating a new production line in hermiston oregon by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 our lambwestonmeijer joint venture in conjunction with a partner in the russian federation initiated production at a newlyconstructed french fry processing facility in lipetsk a special economic zone in south moscow in june 2017 our lambwestonmeijer joint venture also acquired the potato processing business of oerlemans foods which included a potato processing facility located in broekhuizenvorst the netherlands 

  

markets 

  

we operate in the global valueadded frozen potato products industry with the majority of our sales derived from products sold to customers in north america and the remainder sold to customers primarily in asia europe latin america oceania and the middle east 

  

in general demand for frozen potato products grew steadily in fiscal 2018 in north america volume demand growth was driven by quick service restaurant chains “qsrs” and casual dining restaurant chains internationally 

 

demand growth was driven by increased access to consumers through continued expansion in these markets by both north americabased qsrs local qsrs and restaurant chains in addition in emerging markets demand growth was driven by increased affordability due to higher per capita incomes and increased appeal of westernstyle food offerings and diets 

  

in this environment of growing volume demand there was limited available capacity to produce frozen potato products in fiscal 2018 especially in north america which led to increased prices across the industry 

  

outlook   

  

in fiscal 2019 we expect the operating environment to be generally favorable given the continued growth in volume demand and high industry manufacturing capacity utilization levels a number of manufacturers including lamb weston have announced intentions to add production capacity over the next five years largely in europe north america and china which will likely ease the industry’s nearterm production constraints in addition compared with fiscal 2018 we expect a higher rate of inflation for many of our commodity manufacturing transportation and warehousing costs we also expect significantly higher selling general and administrative costs as a result of investments in our information systems and enterprise resource planning infrastructure as well as sales marketing innovation operations and other functional capabilities designed to drive operating efficiencies and support future growth 

  

results of operations 

  

we have four reportable segments global foodservice retail and other for each period presented we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance we define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses product contribution margin excludes general corporate expenses and interest expense because management believes these amounts are not directly associated with segment performance for the period for additional information on our reportable segments see note 13 segments of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k 

  

fiscal year ended may 27 2018 compared to fiscal year ended may 28 2017 

  

net sales and product contribution margin dollars in millions 

  



  

net sales 

  

lamb weston’s net sales for fiscal 2018 were 34237 million an increase of 2557 million or 8 compared with fiscal 2017 net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6 increase in pricemix and 2 increase in volume growth with growth in each core operating segment 

  

global net sales increased 1194 million or 7 to 17442 million compared with 16248 million in fiscal 2017 net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 5 increase in pricemix associated with price increases in both domestic and international markets as well as improved customer and product mix sales volumes increased 2 primarily driven by 

 

organic growth and new business with major restaurant chains in north america while net sales in international markets increased nominally sales volumes declined as we chose to improve customer and product mix as well as lower shipments to certain export markets 

  

foodservice net sales increased 691 million or 7 to 10991 million compared with 10300 million in fiscal 2017 net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 6 increase related to favorable pricing as well as actions to improve customer and product mix sales volume increased 1 which was primarily related to growth of sales of lamb weston branded and operator label products to small and midsized restaurant chains partially offset by lower sales volume of distributor label products 

  

retail net sales increased 643 million or 17 to 4492 million compared with 3849 million in fiscal 2017 net sales in fiscal 2018 reflect a 12 increase in sales volume driven by distribution gains of grown in idaho and other branded products as well as increased shipments of private label products pricemix increased 5 reflecting higher prices across the branded and private label portfolios as well as improved mix partially offset by higher trade investments to support expanded distribution of grown in idaho branded products 

  

net sales in our other segment increased 29 million or 2 to 1312 million compared with 1283 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to favorable product mix in our vegetable business

liquidity and capital resources 

  

in fiscal 2018 we generated 4812 million of operating cash flow and made 3090 million of capital expenditures which included expenditures for significant expansions at our boardman oregon and richland washington facilities at may 27 2018 we had 556 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 571 million at may 28 2017 additionally we had 4966 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility at may 27 2018 currently our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures dividends on our common stock debt service and income tax payments the tax act enacted in december 2017 imposes a tax on all previously untaxed foreign earnings as a result we recognized a provisional transition tax expense of 115 million which will primarily be paid over the next eight years 

  

we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payment of any dividends on our common stock declared for at least the next twelve months 

  

cash flows 

  

below is a summary table of our cash flows followed by a discussion of the sources and uses of cash through operating investing and financing activities dollars in millions 

  



  

operating activities 

  

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

  

the major components of cash provided by operations are earnings from operations adjusted for noncash income and expense items and changes in working capital cash generated from operating activities increased 343 million to 4812 million in fiscal 2018 compared with 4469 million in fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense and other items increased 914 million primarily due to favorable pricemix and volume changes in operating assets and liabilities used 571 million more cash in fiscal 2018 compared with 2017 the decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher accounts receivable levels in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 due to increased sales and timing of collections the timing of payments for accrued expenses relating to employee compensation and accrued interest in fiscal 2018 and the timing of payments for accounts payable these cash outflows were offset partially by lower payments for income taxes primarily related to the tax act 

  

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

  

cash generated from operating activities increased 646 million to 4469 million in fiscal 2017 compared with 3823 million in fiscal 2016 earnings from continuing operations adjusted for noncash income and expense and other items increased 783 million due to favorable pricemix supply chain efficiency savings and volume growth cash 

 

provided by operating assets and liabilities decreased 137 million in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 the decrease in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by more cash required for taxes based on operating performance a buildup of inventory ahead of planned production outages to implement capital projects and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets related to the timing of grower prepayments partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses which related primarily to higher incentive compensation costs attributable to our operating performance

investing activities used 3068 million of cash in fiscal 2018 compared with 2853 million in fiscal 2017 these expenditures include plant capacity expansions at our richland washington and boardman oregon facilities

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of may 27 2018 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

investments in joint ventures 

  

lamb weston has interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities but for which we are not the primary beneficiary we do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities for more information about our investments in joint ventures see note 6 investments in joint ventures of the notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k 

  

obligations and commitments 

  

as part of our ongoing operations we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements debt agreements potato supply agreements and unconditional purchase obligations ie obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices the unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available 

  

 

a summary of our contractual obligations as of may 27 2018 were as follows the expected timing of payments of the obligations in the table are estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  





  



  



  



  



  



  



  

 



  



  



  

for the majority of restricted stock units “rsus” granted the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the rsus vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the table above as the amount is contingent upon continued employment in addition the amount of the obligation is unknown as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 

  

although we expect to pay approximately 65 million to purchase ochoa’s interest in lamb weston bsw such amount is excluded from the table above as it is subject to ongoing negotiations with ochoa once finalized we expect to consummate the transaction as soon as practicable 

  

reconciliations of nongaap financial measures to reported amounts 

  

to supplement the financial information included in this report we have presented adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps each of which is considered a nongaap financial measure 

  

lamb weston’s management uses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures and adjusted diluted eps to evaluate the company’s performance excluding the impact of certain noncash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods the company includes these nongaap financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in that they provide for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when used in conjunction with gaap financial measures is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the company’s operating performance and underlying prospects these nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as alternatives for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap these nongaap financial measures may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures presented by other companies and other companies may not define these nongaap financial measures the same way these measures are not a substitute for their comparable gaap financial measures such as net income loss or diluted earnings per share and there are limitations to using non‑gaap financial measures 

  

 

the following table reconciles net income to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures 

  





  

fiscal 2017 includes a 31 million noncash gain on assets

critical accounting estimates 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s combined and consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis 

 

we evaluate our estimates including those related to our trade promotions goodwill and intangible assets income taxes and allocations made as part of the carve out of lamb weston for periods prior to the separation among others we base our estimates on historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results these estimates require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

  

income taxes 

  

we compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 

  

inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes management judgments are required for the following items 

  



  



  



 

  



  

while we believe the judgements and estimates discussed above and made by management are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances actual resolution of these matters may differ from recorded estimated amounts further information on income taxes is provided in note 4 income taxes of the notes to combined consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10 k 

  

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

  

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions sales promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives the estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and coupon utilization and redemption rates influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories 

  

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products the cost of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates made at the time of shipment or coupon release estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends and include the following quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities current and past tradepromotion spending patterns the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs 

  

the determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer promotion participation particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event 

  

cost allocations 

  

prior to the separation that occurred during fiscal 2017 conagra provided a variety of services to lamb weston such as treasury and cash management procurement information technology general accounting and finance payroll and human resources legal and communications real estate and facilities and other general and administrative services to the extent that costs were not directly attributable to us direct costs primarily include restructuring charges and employee benefits for lamb weston personnel which include certain stockbased compensation pension and postretirement benefits healthcare and workers’ compensation conagra allocated certain selling general and administrative costs to us based on specific metrics correlated with the cost of these services eg employee headcount net sales square footage of office space etc 

  

the above allocations were consistent with historical allocations for lamb weston however conagra did not historically allocate certain other corporate costs to its various segments for any remaining indirect corporate costs which supported lamb weston we were allocated additional selling general and administrative costs using an equal weighting 

 

between the lamb weston product contribution margin net sales less cost of goods sold and advertising and promotion expenses and lamb weston total assets relative to consolidated conagra product contribution margin and total assets 

  

although it is not practicable to estimate what such costs would have been if lamb weston had operated as a separate entity we consider such allocations to have been made on a reasonable basis 

  

new and recently adopted accounting standards 

  

for a listing of our new and recently adopted accounting standards see note 1 nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10‑k 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in the normal course of business we periodically enter into derivatives to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes 

  

based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of may 27 2018 a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to “cost of sales” of approximately 53 million 40 million net of income tax benefit it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 

  

at may 27 2018 we had 16875 million of fixedrate and 6489 million of variablerate debt outstanding we have interest rate risk associated with our variablerate debt a one percent increase in interest rates related to variablerate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately 66   million annually

we were organized as a delaware corporation in july 2016 as a wholly owned subsidiary of conagra brands inc formerly conagra foods inc “conagra” on november 9 2016 we separated from conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by conagra of 100 of our outstanding common stock to conagra stockholders “separation” each conagra stockholder of record on november 1 2016 “record date” received one share of our common stock for every three shares of conagra common stock held on the record date as a result of the separation approximately 146 million shares of our common stock were distributed on november 9 2016 to conagra stockholders on november 10 2016 our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “lw” on the new york stock exchange “nyse” 

  

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with conagra including a transition services agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and trademark license agreement these agreements govern the relationship between us and conagra following the separation and provide for the allocation of various assets liabilities rights and obligations of the parties these agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by conagra to lamb weston for a discussion of these agreements see the section entitled “relationship with conagra after the spinoff” in our registration statement on form 10 as amended as filed with the sec on october 17 2016 “form 10” and note 3 related party transactions of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

research and development 

  

we leverage our research and development resources for both growth and efficiency initiatives we seek to drive growth through innovation by creating new products enhancing the quality of existing products and participating in joint menu planning exercises with our customers we also emphasize sustainability in our research and development activities and continue to drive processing innovations aimed at reducing waste and water usage research and development expense was 106 million 67 million and 72 million in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

raw materials and packaging 

  

our primary raw materials are potatoes edible oils energy and packaging we source a significant amount of our raw potatoes under both strategic longterm grower relationships and shorterterm annual contracts in the united states most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in idaho oregon and washington european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands belgium germany france and the united kingdom we believe that the grower network to which we have access provides a sufficient source of raw potato inputs yeartoyear we source edible oils through strategic relationships with key suppliers and we source energy and packaging materials through multiple suppliers under a variety of agreement types 

  

the prices paid for these raw materials as well as other raw materials used in making our products generally reflect factors such as weather commodity market fluctuations currency fluctuations tariffs and the effects of governmental agricultural programs although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply 

  

from time to time we have faced increased costs for our significant raw materials packaging and energy inputs we seek to mitigate higher input costs through longterm relationships contract strategies and hedging activities where an active market for an input exists as well as through our productivity and pricing initiatives 

  

manufacturing 

  

we own and operate 15 manufacturing facilities for our products see item 2 properties for more information about our manufacturing facilities 

  

in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we source a portion of our products under “copacking” agreements a common industry practice in which manufacturing is outsourced to other companies we regularly evaluate our copacking arrangements to ensure the most costeffective manufacturing of our products and to utilize companyowned manufacturing facilities most effectively 

  

backlog 

  

we manufacture primarily to fill customer orders from finished goods inventories while at any given time there may be some backlog of orders due to the seasonal nature of our manufacturing activities and associated inventory such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant 

  

competition 

  

the valueadded frozen potato products industry in both north america and international markets is highly competitive competitors include large national and international frozen potato product companies as well as local and regional companies significant competitors include the jr simplot company mccain foods cavendish farms and the kraft heinz company some of our competitors are larger and have substantially more financial sales and marketing and other resources we compete with producers of similar products on the basis of among other things customer service 

 

value product innovation product quality food safety brand recognition and loyalty price and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences the markets in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future see also “item 1a risk factors – risks relating to our business – increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits” of this form 10k 

  

trademarks licenses and patents 

  

our trademarks are material to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the united states and most other geographic markets where the related food items are sold depending on the country trademarks generally remain valid for as long as they are in use and their registration status is maintained trademark registrations generally are for renewable fixed terms our significant trademarks include lamb weston lamb’s supreme lamb weston seeing possibilities in potatoes and design lamb’s seasoned lw private reserve stealth fries and sweet things we also sell certain products under brands such as grown in idaho  which we license from third parties as well as alexia  which we license from conagra under a trademark license agreement that we entered into in connection with the separation 

  

we own numerous patents worldwide we consider our portfolio of patents patent applications patent licenses under patents owned by third parties proprietary trade secrets technology knowhow processes and related intellectual property rights to be material to our operations patents issued or applied for cover inventions ranging from basic packaging techniques to processes relating to specific products and to the products themselves our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained the actual protection afforded by a patent which can vary from country to country depends upon the type of patent the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country and the availability of legal remedies in the country while we consider our patent portfolio to be material to our business the loss of one patent or a group of related patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

seasonality 

  

our product contribution margin percentage inventory levels net sales and cash flows are affected by seasonality in general our product contribution margin percentage tends to be highest in the third quarter reflecting the benefit of freshlyharvested potatoes we typically harvest potatoes in the pacific northwest in august through december which is primarily in our second quarter freshlyharvested potatoes process better in our production lines and are not subject to storage or secondary transport costs we typically hold about 60 days of finished goods inventory on a firstinfirstout basis so the relatively favorable costs incurred from our second fiscal quarter harvest flow through our income statement in the third quarter inventory levels also tend to be higher in the third quarter requiring more working capital at that time in general net sales and cash flows tend to be higher in the fourth quarter reflecting customer and consumer buying patterns 

  

employees 

  

as of june 30 2017 we had approximately 6500 employees excluding our joint ventures approximately 400 of these employees work outside of the united states approximately 27 of our hourly employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industry in which we operate most of the union workers at our facilities are represented under contracts that expire at various times throughout the next several years approximately 8 expire in fiscal 2018 as these agreements expire we believe they will be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us

 item 1a risk factors 

  

our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in the future 

  

risks relating to our business 

  

increased competition may result in reduced sales or profits 

  

our business valueadded frozen potato products is highly competitive our principal competitors have substantial financial sales and marketing and other resources a strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing increasing promotional activity or losing market share competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume 

  

increased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits 

  

in recent years market demand for valueadded frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products as additional industry capacity comes online or market demand otherwise decreases we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume 

  

our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations including foreign currency risks and trade barriers 

  

we conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the united states and canada including through our joint ventures a primary growth strategy for our business is increasing our international sales and operations during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 net sales outside the united states and canada primarily in japan china korea mexico and taiwan accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales these amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures 

  

many factors relating to our international sales and operations many of which factors are outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations including 

  



  



  

 



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

disruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

to serve our customers globally we rely in part on our international joint venture partnerships but also on exports from the united states during fiscal 2017 export sales accounted for 21 of our total net sales circumstances beyond our control such as a labor dispute at a port could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities we have access to production overseas through our facility in china and joint venture in europe but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms if this occurs we may be unable to adequately supply all of our customer opportunities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations 

  

we incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the spinoff as of may 28 2017 we had approximately 24029 million of longterm debt including current portion recorded on our combined and consolidated balance sheet 

 

we have the ability under our existing revolving credit facility to incur additional substantial debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could 

  



  



  



  



  



  

the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business 

  

the credit agreement governing our term loan and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability to 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  

these restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to take advantage of financing merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations in addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing 

  

additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs 

  

 

our business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region 

  

ideal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our valueadded products eg french fries are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally in the united states most of the potato crop used in valueadded products is grown in idaho oregon and washington european growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in the netherlands belgium germany france and the united kingdom recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions but the capital intensive nature of our industry’s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions unfavorable crop conditions in any one region could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet customer needs and could decrease our profitability 

  

our business is affected by potato crop performance 

  

our primary input is potatoes and every year we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into valueadded products environmental and climate conditions such as soil quality moisture and temperature affect the quality of the potato crop on a yeartoyear basis as a result we source potatoes from specific regions of the united states and specific countries abroad including the netherlands belgium germany france and the united kingdom where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist however severe weather conditions during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure decreased yields and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes we have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor and manage the potato crop however if a weather or pestrelated event occurs in a particular crop year and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our customer opportunities and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease   alternatively overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and oversupply an increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss 

  

increases in commodity costs may have a negative impact on profits 

  

a significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as oil and energy commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity market fluctuations supply and demand currency fluctuations external conditions such as weather and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations commodity price increases will increase operating costs we may not be able to increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume reduced margins and profitability we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases there is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the united states in addition these practices and experience reduce but do not eliminate the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases as a result the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend 

  

if we do not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category our profitability could decrease 

  

our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive valueadded frozen potato product category we continue to implement profitenhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions these initiatives are focused on costsaving opportunities in procurement manufacturing logistics and customer service as well as general and administrative overhead levels however gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position 

  

 

changes in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us 

  

we expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers in some instances we have entered into longterm agreements with growers however a portion of our potato needs are typically sourced on an annual basis to the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our longterm growers contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities to obtain sufficient potato supply we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected or forgo sales to some market segments which would reduce our profitability if we forgo sales to such market segments we may lose customers and may not be able to replace them later 

  

changes in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us 

  

we maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments customers include global national and regional quick serve and fast casual restaurants as well as small independently operated restaurants multinational broadline foodservice distributors as well as regional foodservice distributors and major food retailers some of these customers independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales while we contract annually or biannually with many of our foodservice customers loss of a significant customer could materially impact the business in addition shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed during each of fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 our largest customer mcdonald’s corporation and its affiliates accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits 

  

some of our customers are large and sophisticated with buying power and negotiating strength these customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing increased promotional programs or specialty tailored products in addition some of these customers eg larger distributors and supermarkets have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands we continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality however if we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers our profitability could decline 

  

we must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences 

  

consumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences we need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences for example as consumers focus on freshly prepared foods some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens as a result we would need to evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment in addition our products contain carbohydrates sodium genetically modified ingredients added sugars saturated fats and preservatives the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny we must continue to reformulate our products introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste texture and appearance that consumers demand in valueadded potato products all of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments if our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

 

a portion of our business is and several of our growth strategies will be conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit 

  

we have built our company in part through the creation of joint ventures some of which we do not control in these relationships we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners rather than our exclusive benefit through our extensive experience in operating our business through joint ventures we understand that joint ventures often take additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decisionmaking if our joint venture partners begin to take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture or begin to disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted 

  

if we are unable to complete acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives or integrate acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

  

from time to time we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives our acquisition activities may present financial managerial and operational risks those risks include i diversion of management attention from existing businesses ii difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems iii difficulties implementing effective control environment processes iv adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers v inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings vi potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses and vii indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers if we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 

  

new regulations imposed by the fda or efsa around acrylamide formation in french fried potato products could adversely affect us 

  

the regulation of food products both within the united states and internationally continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny the presence andor formation of acrylamide in french fried potato products has become a global regulatory issue as both the fda and the european food safety authority “efsa” have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give “browned foods” their desirable flavor acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet including but not limited to breads toast cookies coffee crackers potatoes and olives currently the regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control temperature and material testing low sugar and low asparagine however limits for acrylamide content have been established for some food types in the state of california and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits if the global regulatory approach to acrylamide changes and stringent legal limits are established our manufacturing costs could increase in addition if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation sales of our products could possibly decrease 

  

if we fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties 

  

our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the us department of agriculture the fda the occupational safety and health administration and other federal state local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing packaging storage distribution advertising labeling quality and safety of food products the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits administrative penalties and civil remedies including fines injunctions and recalls of our products 

  

 

our operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the environmental protection agency and comparable state agencies which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change may result in increased compliance costs capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

litigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are or may become party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability product recalls product liability product claims employment matters environmental matters or other aspects of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable as a result litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business 

  

we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage product tampering other adulteration of food products mislabeling and misbranding we may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances which would cause us to incur associated costs those costs could be meaningful we may also be subject to litigation requests for indemnification from our customers or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury illness or death a significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall the destruction of product inventory product availability competitive reaction customer reaction and consumer attitudes even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image 

  

additionally as a manufacturer and marketer of food products we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other national state and local government agencies the food drug  cosmetic act and the food safety modernization act and their respective regulations govern among other things the manufacturing composition and ingredients packaging and safety of food products some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior meaning that no intent is required to be established if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we may be subject to civil remedies including fines injunctions recalls or seizures as well as criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

damage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our customers rely on us and our comanufacturers to manufacture safe high quality food products product contamination or tampering the failure to maintain high standards for product quality safety and integrity or allegations of product quality issues mislabeling or contamination even if untrue may damage the reputation of our customers and 

 

ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions 

  

our reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following or by adverse publicity whether or not valid relating thereto the failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for our operations and activities our research and development efforts our environmental impact including use of agricultural materials packaging energy use and waste management our failure to comply with local laws and regulations our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

  

our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expenses 

  

inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states and foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits changes in interest rates mortality rates health care costs early retirement rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans a significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements 

  

we anticipate upgrading our information technology infrastructure and expect to implement a new enterprise resource planning system problems with the transition design or implementation of this upgrade could interfere with our business and operations and adversely affect our financial condition 

  

under a transition services agreement entered into in connection with the separation conagra currently provides us with information technology services which under the agreement terminates on february 28 2018 we are currently investigating upgrade options for our information technology infrastructure including a longterm plan to implement a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system and other complementary information technology systems after we transition from conagra which we expect to implement in fiscal 2019 we may experience difficulties as we transition to new upgraded systems and processes these disruptions may include loss of data difficulty in processing customer orders shipping products or providing services and support to our customers difficulty in billing and tracking our orders difficulty in completing financial reporting and filing reports with the sec in a timely manner or challenges in otherwise running our business we may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the transition design and implementation of an upgraded information technology infrastructure or a new erp system particularly any disruptions delays or deficiencies that impact our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations even if we do not encounter adverse effects the transition design and implementation of an upgraded information technology infrastructure or new erp system may be much more costly than we anticipated 

  

 

there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 

  

we do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how welldesigned and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met the design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs in addition beginning with our annual report on form 10k for our fiscal year ending may 27 2018 we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are in the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation which process is time consuming costly and complicated 

  

because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks over time controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures if our controls become inadequate we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations our reputation may be adversely affected our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and the market price of our stock could decline 

  

if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience as well as finance marketing and other senior management professionals the market for these employees is competitive and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business if we do not succeed in retaining our current employees and attracting new highquality employees our business could be materially and adversely affected 

  

the potential disruption from cyber attacks and information security problems present new risks 

  

we are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes we could be subject to billing and collection errors business disruptions or damage resulting from security breaches if any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner our product sales financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results in addition there is a risk of business interruption litigation risks and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information 

  

climate change or legal regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations 

  

there is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters in the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products such as potatoes and oils in addition water is an important part of potato processing we may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations the increasing concern 

 

over climate change also may result in more regional federal andor global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases as well as more stringent regulation of water rights in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions improve our energy efficiency and reduce and reuse water we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery 

  

deterioration of general economic conditions could harm our business and results of operations 

  

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions including interest rates access to capital markets consumer spending rates energy availability and costs including fuel surcharges and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions 

  

volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways including as follows 

  



  



  



  



  



  

impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangibles could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

  

as of may 28 2017 we had goodwill of 1330 million and other intangibles of 372   million the net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks customer relationships and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date or subsequent impairment date if applicable net of accumulated amortization goodwill and other acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized but must be evaluated by management at least annually for impairment amortized intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control such as increasing competitive pricing pressures lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates changes in industry earnings before interest depreciation and amortization “ebitda” multiples changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates etc or the bankruptcy of a significant customer and could result in the incurrence of impairment charges and negatively impact our net worth 

  

 

risks relating to our recent spinoff 

  

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff we have incurred additional expenses to create the corporate infrastructure necessary to operate as an independent public company and we will experience increased ongoing costs in connection with being an independent public company 

  

we believe that as an independent public company we are able to among other matters better focus our resources on our specific business longterm opportunities and growth strategies design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus and strategic priorities and implement and maintain a capital structure and financial policy designed to meet our specific needs however we may be unable to achieve some or all of these benefits in addition in connection with the spinoff we have incurred transaction and related costs of approximately 318 million 265 million in fiscal 2017 and 53 million in fiscal 2016 which are not considered part of our ongoing operations we expect to incur additional ongoing costs related to operating as an independent public company and replacing the services previously provided by conagra 

  

prior to the spinoff our business used conagra’s corporate infrastructure and services to support our business functions the expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure were spread across all of conagra’s businesses and charged to us on a costallocation basis except for certain services provided to us on a transitional basis pursuant to a transition services agreement we no longer have access to conagra’s infrastructure or services and we must establish our own the services historically provided to us by conagra have included treasury and cash management procurement information technology general accounting and finance payroll and human resources legal and communications real estate and facilities and other general and administrative stewardship we cannot assure you that all these functions will be successfully executed by conagra during the transition period or that we will not have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated in the transition services agreement any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in addition at the end of this transition period we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf 

  

if we are unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company do not achieve them in the time we expect or incur significant unanticipated costs related to operating as an independent company our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we have a limited operating history as an independent public company and our   historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows nor do they reflect what our financial condition results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented 

  

our historical financial statements do not necessarily reflect what our financial condition results of operations or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows this is primarily a result of the following factors 

  



  



 

  



  

if the spinoff is taxable to conagra as a result of a breach by us of any covenant or representation made by us in the tax matters agreement we will generally be required to indemnify conagra the obligation to make a payment on this indemnification obligation could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

it was intended that the spinoff together with certain related transactions would qualify as a taxfree “reorganization” within the meaning of section 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “code” and a taxfree distribution within the meaning of section 355 of the code in connection with the spinoff conagra received an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that those transactions will qualify for their intended tax treatment however an opinion of tax counsel does not preclude the internal revenue service “irs” or the courts from adopting a contrary position the tax opinion relied on certain representations covenants and assumptions including those relating to our and conagra’s past and future conduct if any of those representations covenants or assumptions is inaccurate the tax consequences of the spinoff could differ from the intended tax treatment if the spinoff andor certain related transactions fail to qualify for taxfree treatment for any reason conagra andor holders of its common stock would be subject to tax as a result of the spinoff and certain related transactions 

  

if the spinoff andor the related transactions are not treated as taxfree transactions or are taxable to conagra due to a breach by us or any of our subsidiaries of any covenant or representation made by us in the tax matters agreement we will generally be required to indemnify conagra for all taxrelated losses suffered by conagra in connection with the spinoff in addition we will not control the resolution of any tax contest relating to taxes suffered by conagra in connection with the spinoff and we may not control the resolution of tax contests relating to any other taxes for which we may ultimately have an indemnity obligation under a tax matters agreement in the event that conagra suffers taxrelated losses in connection with the spinoff that must be indemnified by us under the tax matters agreement the indemnification liability could have a material adverse effect on us 

  

we are subject to significant restrictions under the tax matters agreement 

  

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with conagra the tax matters agreement generally prohibits us during the twoyear period following the spinoff from taking certain actions that could cause the spinoff and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions these restrictions include 

  



  



  



  



  



  

 

in addition during the fiveyear period following the spinoff we may not retire repurchase or significantly modify our senior notes further more generally we may not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the spinoff and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as taxfree transactions under section 368a1d and section 355 of the code if we take any of the actions above and the actions result in taxrelated losses to conagra we generally will be required to indemnify conagra for such taxrelated losses under the tax matters agreement due to these restrictions and indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement we may be limited in our ability to pursue strategic transactions equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in our best interests also our potential indemnity obligation to conagra might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable 

  

we are subject to continuing contingent liabilities following the spinoff including potential indemnification liabilities to conagra and these liabilities could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

in connection with the spinoff we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with conagra that provides for among other things the principal corporate transactions required to effect the spinoff certain conditions to the spinoff and provisions governing the relationship between our company and conagra with respect to and resulting from the spinoff among other things the separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to the lamb weston business whether incurred prior to or after the spinoff and whether known or unknown at the time of the spinoff as well as those obligations of conagra assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement if we are required to indemnify conagra under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement or meaningful unknown liabilities surface we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

  

in addition under the code and applicable treasury regulations each corporation that was a member of the conagra consolidated tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the completion of the spinoff is jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of the entire conagra consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period similar rules may apply for state local and nonus tax purposes in addition the tax matters agreement with conagra allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of any conagra consolidated combined unitary or other tax reporting group between us and conagra however if conagra is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible under the tax matters agreement we could be required to pay the entire amount of those taxes which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

in connection with the separation conagra will indemnify us for certain liabilities however there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities or that conagra’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future 

  

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement conagra agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities however third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that conagra has agreed to retain and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from conagra will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of those liabilities or that conagra will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from conagra any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves if conagra is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations the underlying liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

further conagra’s insurers may deny coverage to us for liabilities associated with occurrences prior to the spinoff even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from such insurance providers we may be required to temporarily bear such loss of coverage

separation from conagra 

  

on november 9 2016 we separated from conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by conagra of 100 of our outstanding common stock to conagra stockholders each conagra stockholder of record on november 1 2016 received one share of our common stock for every three shares of conagra common stock held on the record date as a result approximately 146 million shares of our common stock were distributed on november 9 2016 to conagra stockholders on november 10 2016 our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “lw” on the nyse 

  

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with conagra including a transition services agreement tax matters agreement employee matters agreement and trademark license agreement these agreements govern the relationship between us and conagra following the separation and provide for the allocation of various assets liabilities rights and obligations these agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by conagra to lamb weston for a discussion of these agreements see the section entitled “relationship with conagra after the spinoff” in the form 10 and note 3 related party transactions of the notes to combined consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k 

 

  

in connection with the separation conagra transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of the lamb weston business to us combined financial statements prior to the separation were prepared on a standalone basis and were derived from conagra’s consolidated financial statements and accounting records the combined financial statements contained in this report reflect our financial position results of operations comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of conagra prior to the separation and an allocation of a portion of conagra’s shared corporate general and administrative expenses following the separation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lamb weston holdings inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries the combined financial position results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate standalone public company during the periods presented nor are they indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be in the future information related to the separation and its effect on our financial statements are discussed throughout this form 10‑k 

  

executive summary 

  

fiscal 2017 net sales increased 6 to 31680 million compared with 29938 million in the prior year income from operations increased 39 to 5183 million compared with 3733 million in the prior year net income attributable to lamb weston increased 15 to 3269 million or 222 per diluted share in fiscal 2017 compared with 2853 million of net income or 192 per diluted share in fiscal 2016 

  

fiscal 2017 included 265 million 167 million aftertax of expense for costs primarily professional fees related to the separation and a 31 million 20 million aftertax noncash gain on assets in fiscal 2016 we recognized 53 million 33 million aftertax of expenses for costs related to the separation and 595 million 375 million aftertax of noncash charges reflecting lamb weston’s portion of the actuarial losses in excess of 10 of conagra’s pension liability for conagra sponsored plans in addition fiscal 2016 included a 177 million noncash gain 133 million aftertax related to the settlement of a pension plan of our lambwestonmeijer joint venture 

  

excluding these comparability items net income increased 9 to 3416 million or 232 per diluted share in fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 the increase is primarily due to higher income from operations driven by favorable yearoveryear pricemix volume growth and supply chain efficiency savings the increase was partially offset by higher interest expense as well as higher selling general and administrative expenses related to incremental costs incurred as a standalone public company and higher incentive compensation costs attributable to our operating performance 

  

adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures in fiscal 2017 was 7071 million a 19 increase compared with fiscal 2016 the increase in adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated joint ventures was driven by growth in income from operations 

  

demand for frozen potato products continues to grow around the world we expect to meet the increase in demand by investing in additional capacity we began operating a new line in boardman oregon during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and we expect to begin operating a new line in richland washington during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 additionally through our lambwestonmeijer joint venture we recently expanded capacity in our facility at bergen op zoom the netherlands and are participating in a joint venture that is constructing a new production facility in lipetsk a special economic zone in south moscow the russian federation we expect the lipetsk plant to be operational in the second half of fiscal 2018 in june 2017 our lambwestonmeijer joint venture also acquired the potato processing business of oerlemans foods which included a potato processing facility located in broekhuizenvorst the netherlands 

  

 

markets 

  

we operate in the global valueadded frozen potato products industry with the majority of our sales derived from products sold to customers in north america and the remainder sold to customers primarily in europe asia latin america and the middle east 

  

in general demand for frozen potato products grew steadily in fiscal 2017 in north america volume demand growth was driven by quick service restaurant chains “qsrs” and casual dining restaurant chains expanding potato product offerings through both innovation and increased focus on certain eating occasions namely breakfast internationally demand growth was driven by increased access to consumers through continued expansion in these markets by both north americabased qsrs local qsrs and restaurant chains in addition in emerging markets demand growth was driven by increased affordability due to higher per capita incomes and increased appeal of westernstyle food offerings and diets 

  

in this environment of growing volume demand the excess available capacity to produce frozen potato products tightened in fiscal 2017 especially in north america which has led to increased prices across the industry a number of frozen potato product manufacturers including lamb weston and lambwestonmeijer have expanded or are in the process of expanding production capacity 

  

outlook   

  

for fiscal 2018 we expect the operating environment to be generally favorable given the continued growth in volume demand and high industry manufacturing capacity utilization levels a number of manufacturers have announced intentions to add production capacity over the next five years largely in europe north america and china which is likely to ease the industry’s nearterm production constraints in addition compared with fiscal 2017 we expect a higher rate of inflation for many of our commodity and input costs as well as for packaging edible oil manufacturing transportation warehousing and other manufacturing costs we also expect higher interest expense associated with our capital structure after the separation and higher selling general and administrative costs as a result of a full year of standalone public company costs 

  

results of operations 

  

we have four reportable segments global foodservice retail and other for each period presented we report net sales and product contribution margin by segment net sales and product contribution margin are the primary measures reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance we define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses for additional information on our reportable segments see note 14 segments of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” in this form 10k

liquidity and capital resources 

  

prior to the separation transfers to and from conagra’s cash management system were reflected in “net transfers to from conagra” on the combined and consolidated statements of cash flows conagra funded our cash needs up to november 9 2016 the date of the separation “separation date” our primary uses of cash are for operations capital expenditures cash dividends on our common stock and debt service we believe that net cash generated from operating activities cash on hand available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements including payment of any dividends declared for at least the next twelve months 

 

  

in fiscal 2017 we generated 4563 million of operating cash flow and made 2874 million of capital expenditures which included expenditures for significant expansions at our boardman oregon and richland washington facilities the separation from conagra left us with a significant amount of debt despite this we paid 274 million of dividends and ended the year with 571 million of cash and cash equivalents and 4937 million of aggregate liquidity from unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of letters of credit at may 28 2017 and may 29 2016 we had 351 million and 336 million respectively of cash held in foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested repatriation of these funds to the united states would subject these funds to us federal income taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable

operating activities 

  

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016

cash generated from operating activities totaled 3823 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to 3537 million generated in fiscal 2015 the increase in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was due in part to higher net income also the increase in inventory balances during fiscal 2015 was greater than fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower volumes in international shipments due to the slowdown from the west coast port labor dispute in fiscal 2015 as well as deflation in commodity inputs for fiscal 2016 total dividends received from equity method investments in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were 379 million and 120 million respectively

critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results these estimates require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we review the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment andor complexity 

  

sales incentives and trade promotion allowances 

  

we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions sales promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates and volumebased incentives the estimates for sales incentives are based principally on historical sales and coupon utilization and redemption rates influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories 

  

trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees cooperative marketing programs temporary price reductions and other activities conducted by our customers to promote our products the cost of these programs are recognized as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates made at the time of shipment or coupon release estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred but unpaid are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales timing of promotional activities current and past tradepromotion spending patterns the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs estimates made by management in accounting for these costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends 

  

the determination of sales incentive and trade promotion costs requires judgment and may change in the future as a result of changes in customer promotion participation particularly for new programs related to the introduction of new products final determination of the total cost of promotion is dependent upon customers providing information about proof of performance and other information related to the promotional event 

 

goodwill and intangible asset impairment 

  

goodwill 

  

at may 28 2017 we had 1330 million of goodwill of which 748 million 428 million 109 million and 45 million was recorded in our global foodservice retail and other segments respectively 

  

we maintain four reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing global foodservice retail and other which are the same as our operating segments discussed in note 14 segments of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10k we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value 

  

in conducting our goodwill impairment analysis for our total company and each reporting unit we utilize the income approach based on a discounted cash flow model level 3 measurement the fair value for our total company was also calculated using the market approach based primarily on comparable company ebitda multiples level 2 measurement and was compared to and supported our total company fair value based upon the discounted cash flow approach we believe that the discounted cash flow model captures our estimates regarding the results of our future prospects however we also considered the markets expectations based on observable market information the discounted cash flow model estimates the projected future cash flows to be generated by our reporting units discounted to present value using a discount rate for a potential market participant the following assumptions are key to our estimates of fair value 

  

business projections the discounted cash flow model utilizes business projections that are developed internally by management for use in managing the business these projections include significant assumptions such as estimates of future revenues profits income taxes and capital expenditures our forecasts take into consideration recent sales data for existing products planned timing of capital projects and key economic indicators to estimate future production volumes selling prices and key input costs for our manufactured products our pricing assumptions are estimated based upon an assessment of industry supply and demand dynamics for our products 

  

growth rates a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value in the discounted cash flow model revenue growth assumptions along with profitability and cash flow assumptions were based on historical trends for the reporting units and management’s expectations for future growth 

  

discount rates future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise the discount rates selected are based on existing conditions within our industry and reflect adjustments for potential risk premiums in those markets as well as weighting of the market cost of equity versus debt 

  

based on the results of the quantitative goodwill impairment test we determined that the fair value of our global foodservice retail and other reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying amount and therefore no goodwill impairment existed 

  

nonamortizing intangible assets 

  

at both may 28 2017 and may 29 2016 we had 180 million of nonamortizing intangible assets we review intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment during the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value   in conducting our indefinite lived 

 

intangible impairment analysis we utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology this methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand the following assumptions are key to our estimates of fair value 

  

business projections the relief of royalty methodology utilizes future net sales that are developed based on business projections estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions product pricing and consumer trends 

  

royalty rate a royalty rate for each brand is determined based on the royalty rate that would be charged to a third party the royalty rate is applied to forecast revenue to estimate cash flows 

  

discount rates future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise the discount rates selected are based on existing conditions within our industry and reflect adjustments for potential risk premiums in those markets as well as weighting of the market cost of equity versus debt 

  

based on the results of the quantitative annual assessment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives we determined that the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying amount and therefore no impairment existed 

  

if managements estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions the estimated fair value of goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets could change significantly such change could result in impairment charges in future periods which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill and intangible assets as additional information becomes known we may change our estimates 

  

income taxes 

  

we compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 

  

we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of deferred income taxes balances we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not estimated to be achievable on a more likely than not basis we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable the estimated recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by objective historical evidence as well as subjective evidence including management’s future plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments and future taxable income forecasts therefore future changes in the objective and subjective evidence could affect our assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets and our provision for taxes 

  

we use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether based on the technical merits of the position the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on examination the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating 

 

and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in our combined and consolidated statements of income determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 

  

we have not recognized us deferred income taxes on certain undistributed nonus earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the united states remittances of nonus earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our nonus and us operations material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes 

  

further information on income taxes is provided in note 4 income taxes of the notes to combined consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10 k 

  

cost allocations 

  

conagra provided a variety of services to lamb weston such as treasury and cash management procurement information technology general accounting and finance payroll and human resources legal and communications real estate and facilities and other general and administrative stewardship to the extent that costs were not directly attributable to us direct costs primarily include restructuring charges and employee benefits for lamb weston personnel which include certain stockbased compensation pension and postretirement benefits healthcare and workers’ compensation conagra allocated certain selling general and administrative costs to us based on specific metrics correlated with the cost of these services eg employee headcount net sales square footage of office space etc 

  

the above allocations were consistent with historical allocations for lamb weston however conagra does not historically allocate certain other corporate costs to its various segments for any remaining indirect corporate costs which supported lamb weston we were allocated additional selling general and administrative costs using an equal weighting between the lamb weston product contribution margin net sales less cost of goods sold and advertising and promotion expenses and lamb weston total assets relative to consolidated conagra product contribution margin and total assets 

  

although it is not practicable to estimate what such costs would have been if lamb weston had operated as a separate entity we consider such allocations to have been made on a reasonable basis 

  

new and recently adopted accounting standards 

  

for a listing of our new and recently adopted accounting standards see note 1 nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to combined and consolidated financial statements in “part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this form 10‑k 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and energy foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in the normal course of business we periodically enter into derivatives to minimize these risks but not for trading purposes 

  

based on our open commodity contract hedge positions as of may 28 2017 a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to “cost of sales” of approximately 44 million 28 million net of income tax benefit it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 

 

  

at may 28 2017 we had 16887 million of fixedrate and 6954 million of variablerate debt outstanding we have interest rate risk associated with our variablerate debt a one percent increase in interest rates related to variablerate debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of approximately 71 million annually
